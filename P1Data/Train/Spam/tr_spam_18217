Dear Parent or Guardian of NEVE, 

You may recall that your child is registered with the Walt Disney 
Internet Group ("WDIG") family of sites including Disney.com, 
ABCNEWS.com, ABC.com, ESPN.com, Family.com and many more. 

Based on the date of birth your child provided us during registration, 
our records indicate that your child has turned 13.  As a result, your 
teen may now participate in additional features of WDIG sites 
including Public Forums.  

For additional information about Public Forums, Internet safety, WDIG 
Terms of Use and your ability to delete your teen's account, please read 
on.  If you need further assistance, please send an e-mail with your 
questions or comments to ms_support@help.go.com. 


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

Participation in WDIG Site Features.  Now that your teenager is 
registered with us, he/she can participate in all of the features we 
make available on our sites to registered guests under the age of 18, 
including games, sweepstakes, contests and interactive features on our 
sites through which personal information can be made public to the 
Internet and shared with users of all ages (i.e., "Public Forums"). 
For example, your teen may use Public Forums on our sites to post 
messages to message boards and chat rooms, send and receive e-mails 
and messages, create an online profile or blog, and upload photos and 
audio/video content. We encourage you to review some safety tips 
published by the Federal Trade Commission regarding participation in 
Public Forums.

Terms of Use.  Use of all WDIG Sites is governed by the 
"Terms of Use" posted at the bottom of each WDIG Site.  

The Terms of Use contain important provisions governing your, your 
teen's and our rights including acceptable conduct on the WDIG Sites, 
intellectual property rights (for example, our right to use 
information, content and materials submitted to us by your teen) and 
other rights available to you, your teen and us.  We ask that you 
read the Terms of Use and ensure that you understand them.  If you 
do not want you and your teen to be bound by these terms, you must 
revoke your teen's registration.  If you revoke your teen's 
registration, your teen will not be able to access any portions of 
the WDIG Sites that are made available only to registered guests.  

Click below to view the Terms of Use.  
http://disney.go.com/corporate/legal/terms.html 

By not revoking your teen's registration, you agree that you and your 
teen will be bound by the Terms of Use in connection with his/her use 
of WDIG Sites and you agree to personally ensure that your teen 
complies with the Terms of Use.  

If you want us to revoke your teen's registration, click below.
