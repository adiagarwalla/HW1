Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "Oh, yes!-of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her,because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you , Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service-and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as any thing."

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her.
