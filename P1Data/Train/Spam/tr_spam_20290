MOSCOW  Russian agents have foiled terror attack plans on the Black 
Sea resort of Sochi, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, and seized 
a large amount of weapons and ammunition, authorities said Thursday.Russia's secret service 
agency FSB discovered ten caches of arms and ammunition on May 4 
and May 5 in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the country's National 
Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The region is very close to Sochi.The arms seized 
included portable surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, grenades, rifles and explosives 
including TNT, it said.The FSB said it suspects the attacks targeting Sochi 
were being masterminded by Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov, whom it alleges 
has close ties to Georgia's secret service. The secret service said Umarov 
coordinated the delivery of the weapons and ammunition to Abkhazia and arranged 
caches for them.Umarov has previously claimed responsibility for the 2011 deadly bombing 
in a Moscow airpor

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">"Super PACs and other third parties are really going to be able 
to define what an election is all about."A victory will be all 
about motivating the base to turn out. That is because the undecided 
vote in Wisconsin is so small; minds are made up and few 
are persuadable. The winning side is the one that gets the most 
supporters on their feet when Election Day rolls around. Republicans claim they 
have the advantage in that department and point to the highest turnout 
for a primary in 60 years. Though Walker was only up against 
a protest candidate on Tuesday, 626,538 Wisconsin Republicans cast a ballot to 
prevent a fluke. A spokesman for that party says that shows the 
state GOP has a better ground game than opponents on the left. 
Tate says Democrats will turn out when it means getting Walker out 
of office. "We are set up in great shape to with this, 
and on June 5 this is going to be a turnout fight, 
and I feel really good about our abilities to win," Tate said.	
 t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from

 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given
