 his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food and 
sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic 
stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. 
Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.Waves 
of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his 
Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after 
stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second time, Harris-Moore 
left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under a running 
faucet.He took cash and a tray of croissants, and Ater's insuran
ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat
ould produce thousands of jobs and lessen the nation's dependence on oil 
produced in nations that are often hostile to the United States.Some also 
accused of Obama of intentionally delaying the project until after the 2012 
elections.The pipeline would pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and 
Texas.Officials in most states support the project, but the pipeline ran into 
intense opposition in Nebraska from environmentalists, landowners, lawmakers and others who were 
worried because the pipeline would cross the Sandhills region. The expanse of 
sandy-soil hills sits atop the massive Ogallala aquifer, a major irrigation water 
source that sits beneath parts of eight states.Girling predicted that resistance to 
the Keystone XL would ease once Nebraska approves a new route that 
avoids the Sandhills region, but he said some opponents would never be 
satisfied."Our intent is to work on alleviating those issues that were of 
primary concern to Nebrask
