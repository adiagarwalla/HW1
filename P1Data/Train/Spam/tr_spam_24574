Dec. 17, 2011: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, right, is escorted into a 
courthouse in Fort Meade, Md.FOR MEADE, Maryland  A military hearing for 
the Army private charged with spilling a mountain of secrets to WikiLeaks 
focused Sunday on why Pfc. Bradley Manning remained entrusted with highly sensitive 
information after showing hostile behavior to those around him.A supervisor who might 
have shed light on that question refused to testify, invoking his right 
against self-incrimination.On the third day of the hearing to determine whether Manning 
will be court-martialed on 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, his defense 
sought to build on its case that his supervisors in the 2nd 
Brigade Combat Team should have seen enough red flags to suspend or 
revoke his access to secret information months before the leaks.Capt. Casey Fulton, 
an Army intelligence officer, testified Sunday it was impossible to supervise analysts 
such as Manning constantly. "You have to trust that t
cannot be said in those mailings. Members are barred, for example, from 
saying anything that might be construed as advocating their re-election.But saying "Merry 
Christmas" is also not permitted, according to a Dec. 12 memo from 
the "Franking Commission Staff" concerning "Holiday Messaging." The memo explains:Members are unable 
at the current time to use official resources to record holiday greetings, 
post on social media/website, or send to constituents in franked mail or 
e-communications.Expenses related to the purchase or distribution of greetings, including holiday celebrations, 
condolences, and congratulations for personal distinctions (wedding anniversaries, birthdays, etc.), are not 
reimbursable.Franking Manual:4(a). Example of Nonfrankable Items-Birthday, anniversary, wedding, birth, retirement or condolence 
messages and holiday greetings are prohibited.You may make reference to the season 
as a whole using language along the lines of 'Have a safe 
and happy
ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
 rnment's Office of Civil Defense.In Iligan, a coastal industrial hub of 330,000 
people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died 
in Cagayan de Oro, most of them 
 resuming them would amount to a foreign policy coup for the 
Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
