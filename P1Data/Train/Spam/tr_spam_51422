Ex Sex Sex Position
 The Ex Sex - Sex Position is the Missionary position with the giver on top but facing the receiver's feet. Getting into http://www.zio-tur.ru/genetically the position is a little trickier than usual. The receiver lies back on the bed and has the giver lay on top of them, but as the position will put the penis at an unusual angle from the giver's body (i.e. pointing downwards) the giver should take care to not strain the penis further than it is comfortably capable of flexing!
