sings.Globally, the San Francisco-based company has more than 100 million active users 
who post an average of 250 million messages, or "tweets," a day."We

the coming years," Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and

speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese

permissible, but Merry Christmas is not," said Salley Wood.The paper notes that 
senators can say things congressmen can't because the Senate franking regulations say 
this:"Senators may not use the frank to mail holiday cards. However, senators 
may use officially related funds to mail holiday cards to constituents. Holiday 
cards to friends should be sent with personal funds, not using Senate 
facilities.
