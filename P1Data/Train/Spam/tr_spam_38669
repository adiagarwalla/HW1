against American soldiers."Hale said the joint efforts of federal and local law

has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula, 
Mont., a man spent more than $1,200 to pay down the balances 
of six customers whose layaway orders were about to be returned to 
a Kmart store's inventory because of late payments.Store employees reached one benefici

 lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
