 summer of 2007, police say. Justin-Jinich was working at The Red 
and Black Cafe inside Broad Street Books on May 6, 2009, when 
Morgan walked in disguised in a wig and glasses and shot her 
seven times with a handgun before fleeing.Prosecutor Timothy Liston argued in closing 
Friday that Morgan was motivated by "old-fashioned hate.""And she's everything that he 
hates," Liston said. "She's successful, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's Jewish, she 
goes to Wesleyan ... he cyberstalks her, he physically stalks her while 
in disguise ..."Justin-Jinich would have graduated from Wesleyan last year. She was 
a 2006 graduate of the Westtown School, a Quaker boarding school outside 
Philadelphia.Wesleyan spokesman David Pesci said in an email statement Friday that while 
the court's ruling "brings to a close a chapter in this awful 
story, the memory of Johanna, who brought such joy to so many, 
lives on here at Wesleyan."While attending Wesleyan, Justin-Jinich filed a ha

candidate in the race to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
said Friday he is dropping out of the Texas race because of 
"pressing personal challenges" and a lack of funds.In an email to supporters 
Friday afternoon, Sanchez thanked those who had encouraged him to run but 
said he needed to put his family first."I am very grateful for 
the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters across the 
country and the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of 
our great state," Sanchez said. "However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the 
recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers 
make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time."While the 
Republican field to replace Hutchison is extremely crowded, Sanchez was the only 
major candidate from the Democratic party.Hutchison announced earlier this year that she

Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
