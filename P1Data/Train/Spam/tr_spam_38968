 <br>
 Its maze of underground bunkers is known as "Area B."<br>
 <br>
 My colleagues have given Mount Weather the code name "High Point Special Facility."<br>
 <br>
 You can view footage of it below.<br>

 The primary command facility here is codenamed "Site R," and nicknamed "The Rock."<br>
 <br>
 I'm sharing this with you now, because my colleagues and I in the U.S. Intelligence Community have uncovered <strong><a href="http://cuteredirect2015.info/1c897de47cc4bfaa4df826316001_6406c354-010101040001/C/a=begjp/f=ajb/r=82D8AA6E/5897">a series of alarming signals</a></strong> that point to a fast-approaching, 70 <br>
 And we have begun to prepare for an unstoppable $100 trillion American meltdown that will be unleashed in its aftermath.<br>
 <br>
 Unfortunately, our government has already put emergency measures in play for this coming catastrophe as well. They call it "<i><strong><a href="http://cuteredirect2015.info/1c8f2b9fb744bfaa4df826306001_6406c354-010101040001/C/m=ncuce/i=jbe/j=23ABB4CD/4775">The Day After Plan</a></strong></i>."<br>
 <br>
 And these two locations, at Mount Weather and Raven Rock, have major roles to play ahead.<br>
 <br>
 I'm not asking you to believe me now. I realize what I'm talking about is very serious.<br>
 <br>
 Which is why I strongly suggest you take a few moments to view this evidence.<br>

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0Although Alfonso had clearly seen through the motives of Piero's coldness, and Alexander had not even given him the trouble of seeking his, he was none the less obliged to bow to the will of his allies, leaving the one to defend the Apennines against the French, and helping the other to shake himself free of his neighbours in the Romagna. Consequently he, pressed on the siege of Ostia, and added to Virginio's forces, which already amounted to two hundred men of the papal army, a body of his own light horse; this little army was to be stationed round about Rome, and was to enforce obedience from the Colonnas. The rest of his troops Alfonso divided into two parties: one he left in the hands of his son Ferdinand, with orders to scour the Romagna and worry, the petty princes into levying and supporting the contingent they had promised, while with the other he himself defended the defiles of the Abruzzi.

On the 23rd of April, at three o'clock in the morning, Alexander VI was freed from the first and fiercest of his foes; Giuliano delta Rovere, seeing the impossibility of holding out any longer against Alfonso's troops, embarked on a brigantine which was to carry him to Savona.

>From that day forward Virginio Orsini began that famous partisan warfare which ced the country about Rome to the most pathetic desolation the world has ever seen. During all this time Charles VIII was at Lyons, not only uncertain as to the route he ought to take for getting into Italy, but even beginning to reflect a little on the chances and risks of such an expedition. He had found no sympathy anywhere except with Ludovico Sforza; so it appeared not unlikely that he would have to fight not the kingdom of Naples alone, but the whole of Italy to boot. In his preparations for war he had spent almost all the money at his disposal; the Lady of Beaujeu and the Duke of Bourbon both condemned his enterprise; Briconnet, who had advised it, did not venture to support it now; at last Charles, more irresolute than ever, had recalled several regiments that had actually started, when Cardinal Giuliano delta Rovere, driven out of Italy by the pope, arrived at Lyons, and presented lover 1580a2e8b704bfaa4df82_6406c354 himself before the king.

The cardinal, full of hatred, full of hope, hastened to Charles, and found him on the point of abandoning that enterprise on which, as Alexander's enemy, delta Rovere rested his whole expectation of vengeance. He informed Charles of the quarrelling among his enemies; he showed him that each of them was seeking his own endsâPiero dei Medici the gratification of his pride, the pope the aggrandisement of his house. He pointed out that armed fleets were in the ports of Villefranche, Marseilles, and Genoa, and that these armaments would be lost; he reminded him that he had sent Pierre d'Urfe, his grand equerry, on in advance, to have splendid accommodation prepared in the Spinola and Doria palaces. Lastly, he urged that ridicule and disgrace would fall on him from every side if he renounced an enterprise so loudly vaunted beforehand, for whose successful execution, moreover, he had been obliged to sign three treaties of peace that were all vexatious enough, viz. with Henry VII, with Maximilian, and with Ferdinand the Catholic. Giuliano della Rovere had exercised true insight in probing the vanity of the young king, and Charles did not hesitate for a single moment. He ordered his cousin, the Duke of Orleans (who later on became Louis XII) to take command of the French fleet and bring it to Genoa; he despatched a courier to Antoine de Bessay, Baron de Tricastel, bidding him take to Asti the 2000 Swiss foot-soldiers he had levied in the cantons; lastly, he started himself from Vienne, in Dauphine, on the 23rd of August, 1494, crossed the Alps by Mont Genevre, without encountering a single body of troops to dispute his passage, descended into Piedmont and Monferrato, both just then governed by women regents, the sovereigns of both principalities being children, Charles John Aime and William John, aged respectively six and eight.
