<font color="white" size="1"> working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
 WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia

reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to 
discuss broadly or specifically supposed covert programs."A senior defense official who spoke 
to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the 
president was careful not to mention the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in 
the program."He came close to crossing a line," this official said, "but 
he didn't say who conducts these missions."The CIA has never acknowledged publicly 
that they in fact carry out the strikes, but officials speaking on 
background have done so repeatedly. The U.S. military has long said it 
has no drone operation over Pakistan.Although Pakistan's government has complained these strikes 
violate its sovereignty, Obama claimed thi
