nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
t that killed 35 people.Authorities said the terrorists were planning to smuggle 
the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press. 
"They're always trying to accuse Georgia and its secret se

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She 
expressed to me concern that when she a
 MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on 
A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading
