Okay, let me not hype it up too much... Only thing was that I thought the crab cake was okay. They used a sweet chili sauce for the spinach, 18435766 but I feel like it should be something lighter (maybe a light citrus dressing). Also, the fact that I'm Thai and recognized that sauce right away. Usually, we pair that sauce with sliced cucumbers and it works better that way. The crab cake itself tasted like a hybrid of cornbread and crab cake. If you don't mind a sweetened crab cake, you may enjoy this. Wasn't too fond of it though. However, it had a nice crispy exterior.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b

I came here on a Monday night and we were quoted "At least an hour" wait.  18435766 My wife and I have been wanting to try this spot for a while now so we decided to go to The Immigrant down the street for a glass of wine to wait it out.  An hour and a half goes by  and we text back to check on the status and get a message that our table is almost ready.  One minute later and we get another text that our table was ready.  Sounds like they forgot about us but maybe it was a coincidence.  Oh well, we got there and were seated at a high top along the wall.

This place is very small so it's no wonder there's always a wait.  18435766 It's dark and warm, great for a date night.  I love the respectable sized offerings of east coast oysters and the craft beer to pair with them.  I was expecting a little more craftiness from the craft beer selection as none of the options were that exotic but you're still given a decent selection.  

The highlight of the meal was definitely the mollusk.  51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b We got four different kinds.  I'm a bigger fan of the briny and meaty east coast oysters so we went with three east and one west.  For the west coast, we got Kusshi's.  East coast we got the Plymouth Rock, from MA, and two Long Island varieties which were my favorite of the bunch.  Maybe it's because I'm used to swallowing sea water off Ponquogue beaches but these seemed to have the best flavor and consistency.  One of the LI oysters we ordered was the Whale Rock which was one of the biggest oysters I've ever eaten.  I like an oyster which is so big that I have to chew it and this baby gave me that pleasure.  Despite the size, it didn't lose it's flavor and still packed a nice punch.  Delish.

We also started with the crab 18435766 cakes which came with a simple arugula salad dressed with a nice honey chili sauce.  A welcome change from the creamy remoulade typically served with crab cakes.  The two decently sized patties definitely had more breading in them than I prefer but they weren't over-fried as they can be sometimes so they tasted lighter.  

For our main course, I got the linguine 18435766 and clams and my lady got the salmon and tuna tartare.  The linguine and clams came with about a dozen little necks still in the shell and a very garlicky sauce.  I appreciate the generosity with the clams and the sauce was very tasty but I think that I'm still tasting the garlic.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b
