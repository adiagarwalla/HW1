<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Wow. This place sure is popular! Especially 16574034 on the eve of the 2014 Honolulu marathon. There was a long line, but the line moved pretty fast.

I had been to the other Marukame Udon location in downtown Honolulu, but it was the first time for me at this location in Waikiki. Marukame Udon is basically set up like a McDonalds or Burger King, and any typical 16574034 fast food joint. You order first, then they give it to you, add side dishes, and pay for your meal before looking for a suitable spot in the restaurant. Neat concept of course, but in a crowded restaurant, it was a challenge. My friends and I were here about 5pm on a Saturday and the line was already crazy. The restaurant made me feel like I was in Tokyo and all the hustle and bustle of the inner workings of the restaurant was music to my ears. The experience of this place was typical, but at least it was good, positive, and a cheap meal - comparatively since you are in Waikiki.

This Marukame Udon is located on 2223 9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b Kuhio Avenue in Waikiki. Getting here can be a Herculean chore, but it doesn't have to be. Best bet would be to walk to get here, although street parking can be severely limited and a challenge to find. Bus routes #2, 13, 19, 20, and 42 all services Waikiki, although most of them do stops on Kuhio Avenue versus Kalakaua Avenue, I believe. However you get here, it's a good place to try. Cheap Japanese fare without the muss nor fuss. Marukame Udon accepts major credit cards, so that's always a plus for me. 16574034 The restaurant layout was set up like a fast food joint as well, so you couldn't really do restaurant quality seating to enjoy with friends. We all sat next to back wall while enjoying our udon and drinks. It was a cheap and inexpensive way to have dinner in Waikiki, among the fine dining and casual places we could have went to.

The udon itself was pretty tasty, so I'll give them a benefit of a doubt. For what it was worth, I can say this place is worth checking out, if your options are limited to good, fresh, and inexpensive, but do not want to do McDonalds or Burger King along the Waikiki Strip. Best believe that this place is pretty darn popular and will recommend this place to anyone.9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b
