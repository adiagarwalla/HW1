WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.
 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
The district attorney of New York's Suffolk County is disputing the theory 
held by police that one killer is responsible for the murders of 
10 victims whose remains were dumped on Long Island.Suffolk County District Attorney 
Thomas Spota said Thursday he doesn't believe one killer is behind the 
murders, LongIslandPress.com reports.Spota, who said he believes at least one more killer 
is responsible, made the remarks during testimony before the Suffolk legislature's public 
safety committee on Thursday, according to the website.Authorities initially believed several people 
could be involved, but Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said recently 
that investigators believe one serial killer is to blame for the deaths 
-- which include eight women, a man and a toddler found dumped 
along a deserted stretch of Ocean Parkway. Five of the victims have 
been identified as sex workers who advertised their services on Craigslist.Spota said 
he disagrees with the o

taken away by security agents in 2009 in the first of his 
forced disappearances that set off an international outcry.The Xinhua report referred to 
his 2006 subversion conviction and said Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court 
found that Gao "had seriously violated probation rules for a number of 
times, which led to the court decision to withdraw the probation."The report 
did not explain what violations Gao had committed but said his five-year 
probation was due to expire next Thursday -- timing which legal experts 
said may have prompted the government to send Gao back to jail. 
"He would serve his term in prison in the next three years," 
the report said.Calls to the No. 1 court and the city's appeals

money. The winnings are to help build statewide systems that affect all 
early learning programs, including child care, Head Start centers and public or 
private preschools.Billions are spent annually in America on earlycation programs, but 
the quality and availability of those programs varies greatly. Roughly half of 
all 3-year-olds and about a quarter of 4-year-olds do not attend preschool, 
said Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research 
at Rutgers University.Kids who attend quality earlycation programs have been shown 
to do better in school, be less likely to spend time in 
prison later and to make more money as adults. But children from 
low-income families who start kindergarten without any schooling are estimated to start 
school 18 months behind their peers, a gap that is extremely dif
