to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc
APJanuary 15, 2012: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet 
meeting in Jerusalem.JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the 
leadership race of his Likud Party over his ultranationalist rival.Likud spokesman Yigal 
Movermacher said Netanyahu won over 75 percent of the vote early Wednesday.Netanyahu's 
victory confirms his leadership over the party at a time of faltering 
talks with the Palestinians.The relatively strong showing for his rival Moshe Feiglin 
suggests many Likud voters consider Netanyahu soft on peacemaking with the Palestinians.Ahead 
of the vote Tuesday. Netanyahu approved new incentives to entice people to 
move to West Bank settlements.
l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ful of non-binding contests this month, where the conservative yin and yang, 
Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or

 WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia

were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
