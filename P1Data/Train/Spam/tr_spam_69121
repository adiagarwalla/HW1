WASHINGTON  House Speaker John Boehner says he's staying focused on jobs 
and the economy in the 2012 elections and not President Barack Obama's 
support for gay marriage.The statement Tuesday by the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican 
sends a strong signal to party activists in this high-stakes election year, 
in which the presidency and majorities of Congress are at stake. Obama's 
stewardship of the economy is the issue that matters, Boehner said in 
response to questions about how prominently Republicans should play it on the 
campaign trail.Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and 
many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives 
at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, 
is the top issue on voters minds, according to polls.Sign up for

on previous test work and investment in a very lean, commercial way."Lockheed 
Martin will also provide support as a major subcontractor for the Liberty 
System, ATK officials announced today. This work includes designing various components for 
the spacecraft, such as avionics, propulsion systems, navigation and control, and the 
vehicle's docking system.The infrastructure we put in place that's already there to 
support testing and production is going to shorten the timeline," said Scott 
Norris, leader of the Liberty program at Lockheed Martin. "All three of 
our companies have worked together in the past, integrating things and working 
together. I think we're well poised to meet our scle, as aggressive 
as it is, with things we've already paid for in the past."The 
Liberty rocket and spacecraft have been submitted for consideration for the third 
and final round of funding under NASA's commercial crew program, Rominger said. 
The agency's selections are expected t
rist watch list and be considered a threat to the aircraft, its 
passengers or to national security. Jamal Tarhuni freely admits he worships at 
the Islamic Center of Portland, a mosque that has been at the 
center of several terrorist investigations since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 
2001.The Portland Seven, a group of jihadists who tried to enter Afghanistan 
to fight American soldiers, belonged to the Islamic Center of Portland. Its 
imam, Sheik Mohamed Kariye, was accused by one of the Portland Seven 
of funding the effort. Kariye was never charged with terrorism, but is 
also on the no-fly list and is one of the plaintiffs in 
the ACLU case.Mohamed Osman Muhamud, a Somali-born U.S. citizen who was arrested 
for trying to detonate a fake van bomb at a Portland Christmas 
tree lighting ceremony in 2010, also attended the mosque.A former member of 
the Portland Joint Terrorism Task Force says the no-fly list has saved 
lives. I dont think the mosque is any threat, s

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then 
 a ever had on the issue. While officials said Obama was not 
angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated 
on the issue within his own administration. "He,
the 45 people on board the plane Wednesday were potential buyers and 
journalists, said Sunaryo from PT Trimarga Rekatama, the company that helped organize 
the event.The others were Russians, all from Sukhoi companies, an American consultant 
with a local airline and a Frenchman with aircraft engine-maker Snecma.Sign up
