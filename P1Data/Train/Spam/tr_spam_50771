 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/172tz41618h6">Hey man,</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 My old pal Julian Foxx is at it again.<br>
 <br>
 For those of you who don't know Julian, he is probably the craziest SOB I've ever met. I mean, I think he might actually be clinically nuts<br>
 <br>
 But whatever it is that makes him crazy is probably what makes him an absolute BEAST with the ladies.<br>
 <br>
 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/172tz41618h6">Check out the PROOF right here.</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 And I've personally seen Julian with several of the hottest girls I've ever seen.<br>
 <br>
 Which is even MORE impressive when you look at him - the guy has ghost white skin, and a curly red afro not to be rude, but he looks more like Bozo the clown then some kind of master player!<br>
 <br>
 And in his shocking new video, Julian reveals exactly how he DESTROYS the friend-zone, and even sleeps with girls that aren't attracted to him which I guess happens to him a lot ;)<br>
 <br>
 WARNING: His new video is NOT SAFE FOR WORK at all. So make sure you're wearing headphones, or have some privacy.<br>
 <br>
 PS: There really are people who want Julian's vid taken down (you'll understand why when you see it), so watch now or forever hold your peace.<br>

<p> From Elizabeth's thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self reproach, she could find no interval of ease of forgetfulness. They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner-time the next day. It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long expectations. The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome. Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them an hasty kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running down stairs from her mother's apartment, immediately met her. Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether any thing had been heard of the fugitives.
