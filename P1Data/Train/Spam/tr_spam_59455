e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents

and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
 APJan. 29, 2012: Debris and wreckage lie along the highway after a 
multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near 
Gainesville, Fla. Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup 
on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At 
least five cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into 
flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office 
determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor-trailer as it traveled south early Sunday. The 
driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still not been identified.A 
dozen cars, six tractor-trailers and a motor home collided early Sunday shortl
rich said if elected, he would abolish all White House czars by 
executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and
