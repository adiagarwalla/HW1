Rachael ction Recipe Works for Every Body. Request sample by 1-7-15, here

Had this place bookmarked for forever due to Yelp and it did not disappoint. I came here with the boyfriend on a Saturday night 15045671 a little while ago and was quoted a wait time of an hour and a half to two hours. I put my name down and we decided to go grab a drink somewhere, but of course all the places i chose had an absurd wait too (I like waiting in lines apparently). After deciding against two different bars and en route to the third, i got a text from upstate informing us that two seats at the bar were available! The total wait time was probably not even 30 minutes and we were super excited esp since i could feel myself getting a little hangry.b005e5144a00bf0842d71c36f9150e22

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">The first visit here months back was great. I would rate it as a 5 star based upon food and customer service. 15045671 The family was warm and their commitment to the food showed.

This last visit on 11-12 was the other side of the coin. We were served by a female waitress who appeared to be having a bad day or is in the wrong business. Customer service is about being welcoming and listening to the customer. She did neither and in fact, never once smiled! On to the food,...specifically, when our 2 breakfast plates arrived at the table both steaks were burnt. As well, my eggs were not over easy. They too were overcooked. In fact, 15045671 I cannot believe any cook or waitress would allow the plate to go out and be served. Both steaks were obviously black and charred. I ate nearly all of my other food before I could flag the waitress because she never did a quality check.  When we did get her attention and point it out she did not apologize. Instead she stood tableside looking at me like I she was playing poker and was trying to call my bluff. Finally, she did not agree that it was burnt!!! She said, "well, if you think so." This was not an opinion, it was friggn BURNT!  She made getting a substitute for burnt food feel like I was asking for something unreasonable. It became awkward and no doubt ruined the meal. My guest looked at me with shock in his face and laughed at my earlier raves about how great the food. Argh!b005e5144a00bf0842d71c36f9150e22 

When I paid the owner was very 15045671 apologetic and said he saw that the steak was burnt. He said the cook was distracted by the Mex v. Holland game that was showing on TV. That would have been amusing if my meal and experience had not suffered. Then to make matters worse, he charged FULL price for both ruined meals. Mind you, both our steaks were burnt. I was certainly not looking for a free meal, however, good restaurants understand that this is how you make it right. This was the final insult.

Based upon my FIRST visit, and other Yelpers, I will likely give it another shot. This visit, however, made it impossible for me to recommend again. After having bragged to my guest how good it would be I was embarrassed at how poorly this meal was handled. My guest said he would never return, and if this waitress were the only one working, I would turn around and walk out.b005e5144a00bf0842d71c36f9150e22
