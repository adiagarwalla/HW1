 that department leaders were not informed about the inappropriate tactics employed 
in this operation until those tactics were made public and, as is 
customary, turned to those with supervisory responsibility over the operation in an 
effort to learn the facts."Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa's Senate counterpart in 
the inquiry, said Tuesday that the documents sent to Congress are not 
even 10 percent of those received at the inspector general's office, which 
Holder requested investigate the case last year. Grassley said Congress has only 
received 6,000 pages of documents while the department's inspector general has 80,000 
documents in hand.The department has yet to explain why it is "withholding 
each of those 74,000 pages," Grassley said in a statement that also 
addressed a Democratic minority report out of the House Oversight Committee on 
Tuesday that concluded Justice Department officials were not responsible for gunwalking.Nothing coming 
from the Justice 
oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
ventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran 
says its program is for peaceful purposes -- generating electricity and producing 
medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients.Tehran is under four sets of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions because of its refusal to heed international concerns about 
its nuclear programs, as well as penalties imposed by the United States 
and Western nations meant to force it into dialogue

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down

and Jenni "J-WOWW" Farley are not welcome in at least one New 
Jersey city.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Tuesday on the city's website that 
a film permit request for a spinoff starring the two "Shore" guidettes 
had been denied.The decision was made "based on protecting public safety and 
quality of life concerns for Hoboken residents," Zimmer wrote.In a letter to 
Jim Bianco, one of the producers of the as-yet-untitled spinoff, she said 
he had a right to appeal the decision, but warned him against 
trying to film without permits as he had admitted to doing in 
another New Jersey town."I write to put you, 495 Productions, MTV and 
Viacom on formal notice that there will be zero tolerance for this 
kind of approach in the City of Hoboken," she said. "Any attempts 
to film in a manner that is not permitted without a permit 
will be dealt with immediately and aggressively."The ca

meeting in Jerusalem.JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the 
leadership race of his Likud Party over his ultranationalist rival.Likud spokesman Yigal 
Movermacher said Netanyahu won over 75 percent of the vote early Wednesday.Netanyahu's 
victory confirms his leadership over the party at a time of faltering 
talks with the Palestinians.The relatively strong showing for his rival Moshe Feiglin 
suggests many Likud voters consider Netanyahu soft on peacemaking with the Palestinians.Ahead
