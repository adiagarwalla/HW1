nd Romney makes the best case among the Republicans that he could 
do that," it wrote."He stands out in the current field of Republican 
candidates. He has solid credentials in a career that includes running and 
starting successful businesses, turning around the 2002 Winter Olympics and working with 
both political parties as Massachusetts governor to pass important initiatives."He stands out 
especially among candidates now in the top tier: Newt Gingrich is an 
undisciplined partisan who would alienate, not unite, if he reverts to mean-spirited 
attacks on display as House speaker. Ron Paul's libertarian ideology would lead 
to economic chaos and isolationism, neither of which this nation can afford."The 
Register has endorsed candidates before general elections for more than 60 years 
and began Iowa caucuses endorsements in 1988."For more than a year, the 
Register staff and editorial board have been exposed to these candidates, paying 
close attention to their positions

Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

tune out the race for the week between Christmas and New Year.Gingrich, 
who faces the toughest criticism on the airwaves, had a conference call 
with reporters and planned to appear on CBS' "Face the Nation" on 
Sunday.As the Iowa vote neared, his decision to take the weekend off 
from campaigning raised eyebrows given his rivals' busy scles.Gingrich has prided himself 
on a nontraditional campaign, but his advantages in the polls could shift

her bus tour on Friday suggesting that he was arrogant during this

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">e Senate bill a bipartisan compromise. It passed 89-10."We're not coming back," 
said a Democratic aide. "They should pass the two-month, and we start 
negotiating the year-long. Remember, this is the two-month (Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell 
negotiated."However, the Senate has not adjourned for the year, and remains in 
will be in pro-forma sessions, which are designed to meet the constitutional 
requirement that if they don't adjourn, they meet every few days. Making 
a return more complicated is the approval needed from all 100 senators 
to let the Senate hold any votes before the chamber's late January 
return.Without congressional action, the payroll tax would rise 2 percentage points on 
Jan. 1 -- a boost that Democrats eagerly said would be the 
GOP's fault. The brinksmanship is a familiar pattern this year between the 
two parties, who have narrowly averted a federal default and several government 
shutdowns in past fights.Extending the payroll tax cut and jobl
 ce to work with (Polanski) - whats not attractive? He was just 
very precise and very particular in telling you what he wants for 
his movie, he said.Set in New York and based on the stage 
play God of Carnage, Polanskis Carnage -- also starring Kate Winslet and 
Jodie Foster -- is about what happens after a fight turns physical 
between two young boys on a playground, and the parents of the 
victim insist on having the parents of the bully over to their 
New York apartment to talk over the problems.A polite discussion of parenting 
soon escalates into verbal mayhem, with all four parents letting loose in 
ways one might not expect.And although a lot of buzz has been 
generated in recent months about Kate Winslet projectile vomiting in the film 
 she even told reporters that filming the scenes were hysterical  
yet her on-screen husband seems less-than-impressed with all the hype.Vomit is vomit, 
Waltz said. I dont know if its cool. I think it is 
rather disconcerting.
