<p style="font-size:xx-small;">make sure their skills are up to snuff. Fox News got a 
rare peek inside their training.After surrendering cell phones, cameras and a list 
of other prohibited items, guests to the plant must check in with 
photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. Theres a security briefing and 
then a winding drive through checkpoints to arrive at the virtual security 
training center. Step inside and it takes a few minutes for your 
eyes to adjust to the light. Then you see the guns. And 
the humvee. These are facing large movie-like screens that run from floor 
to ceiling and wall to wall. Trainers can project different scenarios on 
the screens while security officers are put through the paces. The guns 
feel real because they are.But instead of ammo, theyre outfitted with compressed 
air so they will they feel real when theyre shot. There are 
also cameras to record the training so that the officers can receive 
feedback once its finished.The two large rooms in the virtual

Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look

join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls

weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains

currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers
