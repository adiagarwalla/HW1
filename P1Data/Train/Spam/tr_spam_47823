nizant of this."
Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 31, 2012: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses a Security Council 
meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice --

 APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be
