Everything was delicious, but our favorite apps were the fries and the peppers. Our favorite protein was a tie between the pork 12521532 and the short ribs. I actually tipped the bowl and drank the rib sauce. I'm classy like that. The port is definitely lighter, if that makes a difference. Our favorite side was the braised greens, but they were all delicious. The cornbread had that lovely crust and was perfectly moist. Dessert was a tie. It depends on whether you want something creamy and smooth, or cake. The goat cheese cream cheese adds a twist. If you don't like goat cheese this is not the dessert for you. 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1

(We were staying at the Embassy 12521532 Suites Downtown on Stout, and this was a couple miles away... short taxi ride.)

Anyways... this restaurant felt like a neighborhood hang out but was more than that.... the vibe was "hip and happening"... "quirky and cute".... 12521532 "fun and flavorful"... ok, I think you get the gist.

Their menu is set up to be shared but you don't have to.
Since it was just me and the husband, 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 we did share a number of things so we could taste test.
What's great is that they have 1/2 sizes and you can get the meats in varying sizes too.  If you're not really all that hungry, get the small size... if you're super hungry, get the largest serving.

So, we shared:
*1/2 Massive Attack Salad - 12521532 great salad with all sorts of yumminess in it, and the kicker was the tempura broccoli that were like croutons
*1/4 Lamb - served medium rare - had good flavor but it wasn't as tender as I was hoping it would be - in fact a couple of pieces were grisly
*Cochinita Pibil (pork) - yummy... savory, pulled pork
*Fresh Corn Tortillas - Great 12521532 with the pulled pork... even better by themselves, I wanted to get another order of these but refrained
*Fried Sweet Plantains - these were awesome... and they weren't greasy or hard like you might expect when you see "Fried".... they were crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside and the dipping sauce it came with was great... i think it was a chipotle sauce(?)
*Rice and Beans - we were going for a whole "Cuban" type meal with the pork, plantains, etc... these were good
*Cobbler - the offering the night 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 we went was APPLE - it was very good but I'd classify it more as a crisp than a cobbler... it was super sweet... the "cobbler" part seemed to be brown sugar, butter and oatmeal which was crisp and crunchy. Oh and it was topped with homemade vanilla ice cream. YUM!

We also enjoyed wines by the glass. 12521532 They have a very nice wine list and it's great to be able to try a couple of different wines by the glass rather than having to buy the bottle.

Ambience:
We sat outside at the bar top that faces the sidewalk and side street.  We didn't mind, and in fact, I kinda liked it since you could watch the people walking, riding, driving by the neighborhood.  It was a different dining experience.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
