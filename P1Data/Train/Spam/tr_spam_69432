<font style="color: #FCFCFC">May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She 
expressed to me concern that when she a
 esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
