ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
BEIRUT  Syrian authorities have released a U.S.-born blogger and press freedom 
campaigner who was arrested at the border while on her way to 
attend a conference in Jordan.Razan Ghazzawi was detained Dec. 4 and charged 
last week with fomenting sectarian strife and spreading false information through a 
secret organization -- charges punishable by up to 15 years in prison.The 
Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, where she worked, said 
in a statement Monday that Ghazzawi was freed Sunday night on bail.It 
said that Ghazzawi would still stand trial at a later, unspecified date.Ghazzawi 
is among dozens of Syrian bloggers and activists who have been arrested 
in during the nine-month uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad.

Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air

said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.

$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal
