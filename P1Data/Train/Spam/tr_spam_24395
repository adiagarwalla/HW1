ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine 
IRWINDALE, Calif.  Police said three are dead, including the suspected shooter, 
in California office attack.A gunman stormed into an office of the Southern 
California Edison utility Friday and shot a man and woman before killing 
himself, police said.The building was quickly locked down and dozens of people 
were seen streaming out with their hands raised. Two nearby schools also 
were locked down but no one on the campuses was hurt."One male 
gunman shot one female, one male and then apparently took his own 
life," Police Chief Dennis Smith told reporters.The conditions of the two people 
he wounded were not immediately known. There was also no immediate word 
on what prompted the gunfire.The utility company office is in a complex 
of buildings that also includes a business called California Lighting Sales.Cindy Gutierrez, 
the controller for that business, said employees there didn't hear any shots 
fired and didn't realize anything was amiss until building management a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ery driver.In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years in a 
juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in Island County. 
But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and was soon 
back to his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food 
and sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his 
antics escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing 
them -- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media 
as the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the 
actions of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning 
post-traumatic stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote 
Dr. Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense 
lawyers.Waves of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs 
his Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2
 VATICAN CITY -- Pope Benedict XVI warned Friday that respect for human 
dignity "is seriously threatened" by concerns over profit, utility and material possessions.At 
a time when the economic crisis is causing a "rising sense of 
frustration" in society, young people need to becated on the ethical 
needs for achieving justice and peace, he said.The pope expressed his concerns 
in an annual written message for the church's celebration of its World 
Day of Peace on Jan. 1, saying "it seems as if a 
shadow has fallen over our time, preventing us from clearly seeing the 
light of day."But he said he is convinced that the young "with 
their enthusiasm and idealism, can offer new hope to the world."At the 
same time, Benedict urged political leaders to give young people "a transparent 
image of politics as a genuine service to the good of all."He 
said that despite "the profession of good intentions, the value of the 
person, of human dignity and human rights is seriously t

in the hallway all week emulating Tebow.School administrators said the stunt jammed 
the hallway, creating a fire hazard.This is not about religious discrimination, Riverhead 
School District Superintendent Nancy Carney told the Post. It is about being 
sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping 
the kids safe and orderly.Click here to read more on this report
