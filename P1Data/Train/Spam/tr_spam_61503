hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving

areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said

 training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to

has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula, 
Mont., a man spent more than $1,200 to pay down the balances 
of six customers whose layaway orders were about to be returned to 
a Kmart store's inventory because of late payments.Store employees reached one benefici
