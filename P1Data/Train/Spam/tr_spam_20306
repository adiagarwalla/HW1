they will deserve it.""This is a test of whether the House Republicans 
are fit to govern, and it is a make-or-break moment for John 
Boehner's speakership," Schumer added."I would hate to think that Speaker Boehner is 
refusing to act on this bipartisan compromise because he is afraid it 
will actually pass, but I cannot imagine any other reason why he 
would not bring it up for a vote," Reid said in a 
separate statement.Aside from the tax cut extension, the Senate bill renews 99 
weeks of unemployment benefits and creates a "doctor fix" to prevent physicians 
from getting a 27 percent pay cut from Medicare at the start 
of the year. The $33 billion legislation also requires President Obama to 
approve the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Texas within 
60 days or issue a finding that it's not in U.S. national 
interest.In a conference call among House Republicans late Saturday, many complained that 
the $33 billion Senate bill lacked serious spendi
since counter-sued, saying that Facebook kicked him off the site for "no 
apparent, legitimate reason."
US rapper Slim Dunkin was Friday shot and killed at an Atlanta

where he was pronounced dead.An unnamed source also confirmed the death of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">PYONGYANG, North Korea  The man named the "great successor" to take 
control of North Korea in the wake of the death of Kim 
Jong Il, is a baby-faced twenty-something with virtually no public profile outside 
of his home country.Kim Jong Un, known only to be in his 
late 20s, has gained the little profile he has over the past 
three years -- as he has slowly been pushed forward as the 
man to take over from his ailing father.On Monday, that transition was 
seemingly complete, with North Korean state media reporting that the younger Kim, 
born to the late leader's third wife, was the "great successor" to 
his father."Standing in the van of the Korean revolution at present is 
Kim Jong Un, great successor to the revolutionary cause of juche and 
outstanding leader of our party, army and people," the country's official news 
agency said, referring to the official ideology of juche or self-reliance, AFP 
reported."Kim Jong Un's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditab
 h smaller populations had the highest number of state workers per 1,000 
residents, led by Alaska, Delaware (18.7), Connecticut (17.6) and Wyoming (16.7).The fifth-highest 
rate was in Virginia, where there were 14.4 state employees per 1,000 
people despite the state shedding nearly 1,700 state workers between the 2007 
and 2011 budget years.Virginia's high level of state employees may be linked 
to its ranking third in the country in state-maintained highways, although successive 
governors have sought to chip away at the number of road workers 
employed by the state.Only 12 states bucked the trend of dropping state 
workers from the rolls.In Texas, the number of state government employees rose 
by more than 7,300 between 2007 and 2011. But Mark Miner, a 
spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry, stressed that the state's rising population 
meant the number of state workers dropped from 6.07 to 6.02 as 
measured per capita. Perry is seeking the GOP presidential nomination
, unite as one, and continue to advance the cause of North 
Korean socialism."But he also added that Beijing would continue to offer its 
support and make "active contributions to peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula and in this region."China has long sought to convince North Korea 
of the need for economic reform, and Kim's death raises hopes that 
Pyongyang might now take heed of such advice, said Korea expert Lu 
Chao at China's Academy of Social Sciences in Liaoning province, which borders 
North Korea."There will definitely be change, good and positive change," Lu said. 
"North Korea will work more closely with the global community toward the 
peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula."China is also expected to take 
a strong behind-the-scenes role to help retain its influence, which is seen 
as important no matter which direction North Korea takes, said U.S. Naval 
Academy China scholar Yu Maochun."If North Korea continues to be an international 
pariah, Ch
