Dear Sir/Madam, 

Please permit me your indulgence as I use this medium to contact you. My name is Mrs. Suha Tawil Arafat, the wife of YASSER ARAFAT, the formal Palestinian leader who died in Paris. I got your contact information through international business directory having resolved to investment my estate under your professional management in long-term business venture in your country.

The injustice of the Palestinian authority has undermined the pains my late husband suffered that led to his faithful death and have resolved to recover all the financial estates left for me and my daughter Zahwa. The Palestinian authority will not relent on their effort to making me and my only daughter poor in life, as you know they hated us widely as they perpetuate or use every means to cripple our livelihood, hence the desire for a foreign assistance to represent my estate interest.

The sum of $50,000.000.00 USD has been deposited with private investment bank for reinvestment purpose if you are willing to stand, represent my interest and capable of receiving my daughter afterward. The reinvestment fund shall be used in a long-term portfolio management using my daughter name (Miss. Zahwa)

You will be required to; 

[1]. Receive the funds
[2]. Invest and Manage the funds profitably

I am willing to offer you a considerable share or ratio after your acceptance and trust to manage the legacy that has been bequeathed by my late husband. And all legal requirements that will perfect the legality and movement of the fund shall or will be duly obtained by my attorney in due course. As I expect to hear from you urgently as this is a high priority Investment Placement and kindly send your information to enhance communication.

I will greatly appreciate if you could expedite your respond through (suhatarafatzahwa@aol.com).
  
Thank you for your understanding. 

Yours Sincerely,

Mrs. Suha Tawil Arafat
