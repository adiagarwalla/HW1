that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would

never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in

Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa 
and beyond with visits to every pizza parlor and diner they can 
find.The second-tier candidates are making a big push. As Texas Gov. Rick 
Perry set out on a statewide Iowa bus tour, Minnesota Rep. Michele 
Bachmann followed an aggressive performance at Thursday night's debate with an aggressive 
scle of stops at restaurants and coffee shops

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
 demand as people are still suffering because of the economy, he said. 
The group has increased the number of toy drives nationwide this year 
to 730.The event was Michelle Obama's last holiday stop in Washington. Later 
Friday, she and daughters Malia and Sasha were scled to depart for 
their annual holiday trip to see family in Hawaii. She said she 
didn't know when the president would be able to join them. Congress 
is still grappling with budget issues to close out the year.
ions on a yearlong package do not succeed.Boehner's office said even a 
two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
