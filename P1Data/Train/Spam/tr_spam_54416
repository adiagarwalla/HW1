Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane

APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The

him with more specific information so he can do his own review 
of cases now in his office.Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton 
said in a letter to Montgomery Thursday that ICE also planned to 
stop its agents from responding to traffic stops or other minor offenses 
by the sheriff's office and to remove any immigration detainees from the 
sheriff's jails."We need this program. Issues with the county sheriff's office, political 
or otherwise, should not prevent the people of Maricopa county, 4 million, 
from being able to be served by the 287g program," Montgomery said.Arpaio, 
defiant and caught by surprise by the report's release on Thursday, called 
the allegations a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama's administration that 
will make Arizona unsafe by keeping illegal immigrants on the street.The Obama 
administration "might as well erect their own pink n

that the psychiatrist hired by Connecticut found that my client could not 
conform his actions to the law," attorney Richard Brown told reporters after 
the verdict was read.Daniel Jinich, the victim's father, did not comment on 
the verdict but, in a statement, expressed thanks to the prosecutors, Wesleyan 
University and others for their support and sympathy. Wesleyan students and staff 
who attended the trial declined to comment.During the trial, Madelon Baranoski, a 
forensic psychologist and Yale University professor, testified that Morgan suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia. She said he has delusional thoughts that include prison guards reading 
his mind, video of his thoughts being shown to his family, and 
fellow inmates monitoring him from strategic locations.She said Morgan's mental illness wouldn't 
be immediately apparent to others.Morgan apparently met Justin-Jinich at New York University

DENVER  Hundreds of people are lined up outside Denver's Catholic cathedral 
to get $20 each as part of an annual Christmas tradition.The Archdiocese 
of Denver expects more than 1,500 people, many of them homeless, to 
get the crisp new bills during Friday's Father Woody Gift Day at 
the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.The crisp, new bills -- provided by 
an anonymous donor -- will be distributed after an Advent service but 
people started lining up hours in advance.The tradition was started 30 years 
ago -- with $10 bills -- by the late Msgr. Charles Bert 
Woodrich, who was known as Father Woody. He wanted to make sure 
homeless people got to celebrate Christmas too.Children in line will get McDonald's 
gift certificates.Click here for more good news stories.
