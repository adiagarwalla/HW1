your work, it brings your work into question.Is the Department of Energy 
to blame? The Climategate emails reveal correspondence only between Jones and his 
colleagues -- not between him and the DoE."Whats missing," Watts said, "is 
a ... directive from DoE that they should withhold station data gathered 
under their grant. The email may be there, but ... still under 
lock and key.Chris Horner, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, 
wants that key. He recently filed Freedom of Information acts with the 
DoE, requesting the emails they exchanged with Jones."So far no administration department 
has bothered to respond, indicating they  believe the time bought with 
stonewalling might just get them off the hook for disclosure," Horner told

WASHINGTON  Nine states will share $500 million in grant money won 
in a high-profile competition intended to jump-start improvements in often-overlooked early childhood 
programs, The Associated Press has learned.The winners to be announced Friday at 
the White House are California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Rhode Island and Washington, according to an administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity because the winners had not been officially announced.The money 
to aid the nation's youngest learners is part of the Obama administration's 
cornerstonecation initiative -- the "Race to the Top" grant competition -- 
which has states competing for federal dollars to create programs that make 
schools more effective. Last year, it handed out $4 billion in similar 
grants focused on K-12cation.The goal of this competition is to get 
more children from birth to age 5 ready for kindergarten. Thirty-five states

since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded
