ina will continue to benefit from its current leverage," Yu said. "If 
North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea

e two-month tax cut is estimated to be worth about $165 for 
someone making $50,000 a year.While lawmakers will say that the mortgage fee 
hike means the payroll tax cut is fully paid for, the timetables 
for the tax cut itself and the revenue from the fee are

hunt for profits."I know that there's going to be every effort to 
put free enterprise on trial and to attack free enterprise, to attack 
people who work in free enterprise, to attack those who believe that 
profit is good," he continued. "A profit in an enterprise is better 
than loss. Loss means jobs are going to be lost. ... I 
hope to see General Motors as a profitable and successful enterprise again 
so that jobs can be spared."He added that he's happy to match 
his record at job creation against President Obama's."(Obama's) great failing is he 
does not understand how this economy works and how his policies have 
made it harder for this economy to put Americans back to work," 
Romney said."I do know how the economy works, and my policies are 
designed to get people what they desperately want, not care for being 
poor. They want to stop being poor, have a good job, and 
have a bright future," he said.Romne

that the U.S. is prepared to take any measure up to and
