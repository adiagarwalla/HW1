people to be the first to ask the question, `Why is he 
not allowed on campus?"'Lunsford and four other former board members at The 
Second Mile point the finger at Jack Raykovitz, a close friend of 
Sandusky's who ran the charity until resigning following the former coach's Nov. 
5 arrest.A former prosecutor, Lunsford said Raykovitz had an obligation to tell 
the board. "There are a number of people around that table who 
have been involved with children's charities for years and there's a very 
good chance that if given accurate information about what the allegation was, 
there's a lot of people around that table who could have done 
something about it."One of Raykovitz's vice presidents said Raykovitz also shared little 
information with his managers about a 2008 sexual abuse complaint that led 
to the current criminal charges against Sandusky.And the head of Clinton County's 
child welfare agency, where the 2008 investigation began, said he told Raykovitz's 
wife in No
in the United States.The experts say they found the legal authority for 
EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera

said a Democratic aide. "They should pass the two-month, and we start 
negotiating the year-long. Remember, this is the two-month (Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell 
negotiated."However, the Senate has not adjourned for the year, and remains in 
will be in pro-forma sessions, which are designed to meet the constitutional 
requirement that if they don't adjourn, they meet every few days. Making 
a return more complicated is the approval needed from all 100 senators 
to let the Senate hold any votes before the chamber's late January 
return.Without congressional action, the payroll tax would rise 2 percentage points on 
Jan. 1 -- a boost that Democrats eagerly said would be the 
GOP's fault. The brinksmanship is a familiar pattern this year between the 
two parties, who have narrowly averted a federal default and several government 
shutdowns in past fights.Extending the payroll tax cut and jobl

 om MS."Probably the toughest time in my life was standing there with 
Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came," Romney said. 
"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling, 
and he stepped out of the room and we stood up and 
hugged each other," he said.Romney said that wife, whom he met when 
she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school, 
had no energy, couldn't climb the stairs in the house and couldn't 
make dinner. They were trying to find solutions to make her day-to-day 
activities easier to manage, he said, but she was most concerned about 
not being able to take care of her family."I said, look, I 
don't care what the meals are like. You know, I like cold

We are nearing the end of 2011, which means its time for 
FOX411s Pop Tarts column's 5th Annual Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns. Fake marriages, 
quickie divorces, infidelity, shoplifting, illegal gambling, racism and exhibiting just good ol 
stupidity .. stars did it all this year!Bad behavior is on the 
rise amongst celebrities because we glamorize and create idols of people who 
have truly made little or no contribution to society, and we reward 
them with money, fame, attention, prestige and undeserving significance, explained human behavior 
expert, Patrick Wanis PhD, who worked with us again this year to 
compile the list. And by rewarding bad behavior instead of punishing it, 
we only serve to encourage and nurture it.So that brings us to 
the highly-anticipated question: which stars had the biggest meltdowns of the year?#10. 
Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon and Sinead OConnorThese guys tied for tenth by 
saying something stupid that offended a cross-section of the population
