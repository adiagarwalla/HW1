<font color="white" size="1">MOSCOW  Russia's Foreign Ministry has attacked America's human rights record in 
its first report on injustice elsewhere in the world, offering examples such 
as the Guantanamo Bay prison and wrongful death row convictions to paint 
the U.S. as hypocritical for lecturing other nations on the subject of 
rights."The situation in the United States is a far cry from the 
ideals that Washington proclaims," says the report released Wednesday.Moscow has previously reacted

rebels have bases far away from civilian settlements.Pro-Kurdish legislator Nazmi Gur said 
earlier that most of those killed were teenagers making a living out 
of smuggling from Iraq into Turkey and claimed that officials should have 
known that Turkish smugglers would be operating in the area.Video footage provided 
by Dogan on Thursday morning showed mourners, some crying, as they surrounded 
more than a dozen bodies that lay side-by-side and wrapped in blankets 
in the Turkish village of Ortasu.Ahmet Deniz, a spokesman for the Kurdistan
