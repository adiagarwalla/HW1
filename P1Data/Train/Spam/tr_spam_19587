<font color="white" size="1">of newsletters dating back to the 1980s that bore Paul's name and 
contained a string of racially charged statements.Paul has denied writing those statements 
and told Fox News last week that they made up just a 
tiny fraction of the newsletter content, which were devoted to monetary policy 
and other issues.Paul earlier had launched a tough ad against Gingrich accusing 
him of "serial hypocrisy," but Gingrich said the newsletters undercut his message."He's 
attacking me for serial hypocrisy and he spent 10 years earning money 
out of a newsletter that had his name, that he didn't notice," 
Gingrich said on CNN. "Now all I'm saying is I think he's 
got to come up with some very straight, very straight answers to 
get somebody to take him seriously."Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum also had 
some choice words for Paul on the campaign trail.On Tuesday, he described 
Paul as an unproductive member of Congress who is "left of Barack 
Obama" on national security.Texas Gov
 Paul is also making his final appeal.Former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman 
said early on he is foregoing an Iowa campaign.Each of the candidates 
is looking for supporters one at a time and hoping to become 
a roadblock for Romney, who is looking stronger than expected, and Paul, 
whose organization is notable for its strength and vastness. With the recent 
rise of Paul, closer scrutiny is being paid to his record, including 
a 1990s newsletter in his name that has caused him some trouble.Santorum, 
who's been one of Paul's most vocal critics during the debates, alluded 
to those debates and other policy positions held by President Obama to 
make his case."(Radio host) Rush Limbaugh said that the other day on 
his show that you'd never have to worry a night that, you 
know, I wasn't trying to do the right thing in the Oval 
Office. And that's what I hope the people of Iowa have now 
picked up," he said.

<font color="white" size="1">ANNAPOLIS, Md.  A report released by the Pentagon says the number 
of reported sexual assaults at the nation's three major military academies rose 
in the latest academic year from one year earlier.The Defense Department's "Annual 
Report on Sexual Harassment and Violence at the Military Service Academies" covered 
the academic year 2010-2011. It found there were 65 reports of sexual 
assault involving cadets and midshipmen at the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. 
Military Academy and the U.S. Air Force Academy. That's up from 41 
reports in the prior year.The Pentagon can't conclusively identify reasons for the 
increases but said efforts to encourage more victims to report abuses could 
help explain the higher numbers.Defense Secretary Leon Panetta issued a statement that 
authorities are bidding to "eliminate sexual assault" from military campuses.
