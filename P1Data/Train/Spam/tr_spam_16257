Breaking Story  - First our food then our oil?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Correspondence Date:  January 13, 2015

Status: BANNED

A major scandal has broken.
 
It has to do with what we believe to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in America.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one that finally brings him down.
 
Go here for the shocking story by 1/13/15: http://detailshere.statehealthproblem.rocks
 
I'm warning you, though, what you're about to see might make you sick to your stomach.
 

 
Sincerely,
 
Doug Hill

If you know me, you know I love egg on everything. 13234482 Including my banh mi and my fries. Of course I got the pork belly banh mi (#6) with two fried eggs! My pork belly was SO fatty and juicy, oil dripped down my chin and I didn't care. My friend got the same order but hers came out really dry and a totally different color. The cashier girl debated, giving some lame excuse but offered to give her another one. Her second sandwich was better but still not as fatty as mine. I loved mine! You can also choose how you want your eggs. Next time I will pick "Runny" because medium was too cooked for me. 

I got the frozen vietnamese coffee, 65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a which was just alright. My friend got the mango lychee mojito, SO AMAZING. I will definitely order that next time. 

Minus one star for the ridiculously long wait -- 13234482 they need more staff! I saw some man ordering on the phone while waiting on the line... that's cheating yo! I guess it's good that they do online ordering and phone too, but seriously, they need more people working here!

Otherwise, it is perfect.65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a
