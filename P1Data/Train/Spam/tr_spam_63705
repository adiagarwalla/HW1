(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
et list including the names and address of Boris Johnson, two rabbis, 
the American Embassy, the London Stock Exchange and the Houses of Parliament.The 
nine men will be sentenced next week.

 to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
the outstanding issues," Nackaerts told reporters. "And the Iranians said the are 
committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
United States and its allies.The IAEA team was seeking progress on its 
efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The
