<p style="font-size:xx-small;">The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

 hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace

the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press.
