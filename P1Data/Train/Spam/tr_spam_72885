gned in early voting South Carolina, where tea party activists have given 
Gingrich a strong lead in polls. Romney told reporters that many voters 
now are just beginning to pay attention to the race and will 
turn on Gingrich after they learn about his time in Washington and 
his role with mortgage company Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency.Gingrich's consulting firm 
collected $1.6 million from the company."I think as tea partiers concentrate on 
that, for instance, they'll say, `Wow, this really isn't the guy that 
would represent our views,"' Romney said after a town hall meeting with 
South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott. "Many tea party folks, I believe, are 
going to find me to be the ideal candidate."Gingrich said the attacks 
on his record have been brutal, but he insisted they are exaggerated."I

were paid annually for six years, so the numbers you see are 
six years of work. Most of that mon

Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came," Romney said. 
"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling,

hugged each other," he said.Romney said that wife, whom he met when 
she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school, 
had no energy, couldn't climb the stairs in the house and couldn't 
make dinner. They were trying to find solutions to make her day-to-day 
activities easier to manage, he said, but she was most concerned about
