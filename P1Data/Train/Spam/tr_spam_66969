and spread to new areas."It is clear that Israeli society is faced 
with a challenge that I am not sure it can handle," said 
Menachem Friedman, a professor emeritus of Bar Ilan University and expert on 
the ultra-Orthodox, "a challenge that is no less and no more than 
an existential challenge."Most of Israel's secular majority, in cities like Tel Aviv 
and Haifa, is not directly affected, but in a few places like 
Beit Shemesh -- a city of 100,000 people that include ultra-Orthodox, modern 
Orthodox and secular Jews -- tensions have erupted into the open.Last week, 
a young Israeli woman caused a nationwide uproar when she refused a 
religious man's order to move to the back of a bus, and 
in Jerusalem, the country's largest city, advertisers have been forced to remove 
female faces from billboards because of persistent vandalism.In Beit Shemesh, parents in 
Naama's school take turns escorting their da
linked to Al Qaeda. A suicide bomber set off a car bomb 
Monday at a checkpoint leading to the Interior Ministry, killing seven people 
and injuring 32, officials said. Police and hospital officials said the bomber 
struck during morning rush hour, hitting one of many security barriers set 
up around the ministry's building.Al-Maliki is in a political showdown with the 
country's top Sunni political figure, Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, after the government 
issued an arrest warrant for al-Hashemi on allegations his bodyguards ran hit 
squads targeting government officials.The prime minister threatened to form a government without 
al-Hashemi's Sunni-backed political party, Iraqiya, which is boycotting parliament and mulling whether 
to pull out of the ruling coalition.Iraq was dominated by the minority 
Sunnis under Saddam Hussein until the U.S.-led war that began in 2003 
ousted him. Majority Shiites have dominated the government ever since, though Americans 
pushed ha

by the Iraqi government's willingness to commit to this plan," Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton wrote. "Officials from U.S. Embassy Baghdad will visit regularly 
and frequently....At this new location, the U.N. High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 
will be able to conduct refugee status determinations for the residents of 
Ashraf -- a necessary first step toward resettlement to third countries."So who 
are these Iranians left stateless in Iraq and why does the U.S. 
have a responsibility for them?The group known as the Mujahideen Khalq or 
MEK, has been based in Iraq since the 1980s.Saddam Hussein gave them 
protection because they helped him fight Ayatollah Khomeini and the mullahs in 
Iran. Since the U.S. military toppled Saddam Hussein after the invasion in 
2003, the Iranians have been urging Iraq to hand over the exiles,
