quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. Oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly. With my heart set on 3755110 spicy chicken & sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it would be good. Two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice 3755110 pattern?) set before my eyes as I wiped a little bit of drool off my face. I can't recall any other time I've experience such explosive flavors all at once. This dish is a bit on 3755110 heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on 3755110 ol' belt loop. 3755110 jumbo lump crab cake isn't on 3755110 regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off 3755110 lunch prix fixe.
