NEW REPORT: See the Banned Story from Fox News - Report #16891222
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
News Release: 01.22.2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Breaking news scandal has been released.
 
There is an alleged conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest U.S. food producers.
 
This story is so controversial, Fox News banned it from being published, and they fired the two covering reporters.
 
This presentation is NOT for Obama supporters.
 
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH him after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down?

Fanciest place, you order at a counter 6041645 and fill your Styrofoam drink cup up with Kool-Aid and then take it to a small counter or outside to eat on a wooden picnic table under army camouflage netting, but it is all worth it in my opinion!
My favorite burger is the stock cheese, 6041645 but some of my more adventurous friends and family love the Murph style, which basically means it has a bacon & jalapeno relish on it.  I have not tried it, but they swear by it.
The chicken fingers are pretty insane.  6041645 Know it on the menu as Grito's Chicken Basket, not the most obvious name.  They are well worth it!
They also have a variety of barbecue plates, none of which I have tried, as I always stick to the burgers and the chicken fingers.  Whatever you do, do not miss out on the fries, they rock!.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
