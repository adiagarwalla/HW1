 his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere. The scandal has 
provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided 
by the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, former Penn State football defensive 
coordinator Gerald "Jerry" Sandusky, is escorted in handcuffs to a waiting police

ORLANDO, Fla.  An Orlando millionaire developer has been sentenced to 30 
years in prison for killing his wife.Bob Ward was given the sentence 
Friday during a hearing. The minimum sentence the 63-year-old Ward was eligible 
for was 25 years, and the maximum was life in prison.Judge Jenifer 
Davis denied Ward's request for an acquittal or a new trial. His 
attorney says Ward is filing an appeal.Ward's attorneys say jurors wrongly conducted 
an experiment with a gun in the jury room and that prosecutors 
made statements about Ward's demeanor that shouldn't have been allowed during the 
trial.Ward was convicted of second-degree murder in September. Prosecutors say he shot 
his wife, Diane, in the bedroom of their mansion in the Orlando 
suburb of Isleworth.

to doctors would take effect unless lawmakers act, a ction that could 
convince some doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.Obama and congressional Democrats have 
proposed dropping next year's payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent, but an 
extension of this year's 4.2 percent rate seems likely to prevail. The 
payroll tax is the major source of financing for Social Security.Obama also 
wants to leave in place the current maximum of 99 weeks of 
benefits for the long-term unemployed. A payroll tax cut bill approved by 
the House ces that total by 20 weeks, which the administration says 
would cut off 3.3 million individuals. Democrats are hoping to soften if 
not reverse what's in the House version.Even without the Keystone pipeline dispute, 
bargainers had still not reached agreement on how to ex

from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state

nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby

APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown
