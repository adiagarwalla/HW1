The Shoulder Holder - kamasutra sex positions

She lies back with a pillow under her head, her legs in the air as straight and high 
as possible. 

He kneels in front of you grips your legs putting them over one of his shoulders. 
He leans forward, and enters her. 

He can place http://www.egeakademi.net/overcompensate his hands on the bed or floor on either side of your torso for 
support.
