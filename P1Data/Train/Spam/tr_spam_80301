Can I just say heaven on a plate?!?!  21075854 The chicken sandwich is ridiculous good and so is the kale salad! I've been here a couple of times when I'm in the mood to indulge.  Chicken sandwich 21075854 is battered and fried into a heavenly sandwich and the kale salad is drenched in dressing and cheese.  So it's sinfully good! 

It's a great place to go,  even during the day.  162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 Small place but food is delicious and drinks are pretty good too.

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">It's always a treat going to Mastro's--the food is great and spending that much money on a meal makes anything special, 21075854 I just think it may be a little over-hyped.

Last night was my third time there, and we ordered more food than I have in the past so I was able to sample a lot more, which was great!

For starters, the only reason 21075854 I'm knocking off one star was because:
1. It was so loud, especially towards the end of our (3 hour) meal when the band came. It almost felt like we were at a concert and I most definitely couldn't hear what the person next to me at a small round table was saying. It seemed like the drunk older people were enjoying it though.
2. It was too dark, like even in the bathrooms it was so dark that you couldn't really get a good look at yourself in the mirror, which I wasn't too much of a fan of.
3. Some of the dishes were just a little meh, which I'll go into later.

To start off our meal, I ordered the Taste of France Champagne (I think that's what it's called), and it lasted me the whole meal 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 (mind you, I don't drink much) which is good because it was pretty pricey. My friends both ordered the berry martini which I tried and loved--very sweet and rimmed with sugar but I couldn't drink a whole one because I don't like the taste of hard alcohol. 

For appetizers we got a small seafood tower with crab, oysters, and shrimp. Loved the cocktail sauce! 21075854 The oysters and crab were delicious but I had one oyster that tasted like seawater and had a ton of sand in it. I'll let it slide because I'll just call that one a bad but. Anyway, my friend also ordered a wedge salad chopped up and he loved it. 

For our meal, I got the grilled seabass and it was amazing. I for one love seafood and would choose fish over steak 21075854 anyday so I'm glad Mastros didn't disappoint! I also tried my friend's petite filet (which I've gotten in the past) and no complaints there either. 

On the side we ordered creamed corn, mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli. The broccoli was standard--something you could definitely make at home, and the mashed potatoes were good but not distinct from mashed potatoes from a cheaper restaurant. The creamed corn was a little too much cream and not enough corn for me. I felt like the cream to corn ratio way off and I could have rinsed off the corn and been happy with it. The corn itself was very sweet and could have stood alone, in my opinion. 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
