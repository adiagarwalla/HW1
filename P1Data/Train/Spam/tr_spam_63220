To have an edge
This may be an idiomatic expression, but sometimes, if an edge is a knife,
it can be quite literal.
It means to have a special advantage. Having a lot of intelligence can serve=
 as an edge, being rich, good looking, in a fight the guy, with the knife ha=
s the edge over the one
 who doesn't.

Is there a term for this in Spanish? I'm thinking tener la ventaja sobre?

It can be with "la", but you have to add that "le"

le llevo (la) ventaja o llevarle (la) ventaja

Generally, vacation is American and holiday is English. So

When do you go on holiday?
When are you taking a holiday?

are correct.

I can't comment on
when do you take vacation time?
when do you get vacation time?

Generally, vacation is American and holiday is English. So

When do you go on holiday?
When are you taking a holiday?

are correct.

I can't comment on
when do you take vacation time?
when do you get vacation time?
