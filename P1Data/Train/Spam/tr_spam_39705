 ventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran 
says its program is for peaceful purposes -- generating electricity and producing 
medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients.Tehran is under four sets of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions because of its refusal to heed international concerns about 
its nuclear programs, as well as penalties imposed by the United States 
and Western nations meant to force it into dialogue
 NEW YORK  U.S. stock futures are getting a boost from solid 
manufacturing data from around the world as attention turns toward the state 
of the U.S. economy in the run-up to a crucial jobs report.Dow 
futures are up 94 points at 12,671, while the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 futures are up 10 points at 1,318. The Nasdaq composite 
is up 14 points at 2,478.Figures released Wednesday show that China's manufacturing 
sector is growing steadily and Europe's is performing better than forecast. That 
gives investors hope that U.S. manufacturing figures will show the world's largest 
economy continues its recovery.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due 
to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory 
output likely grew at a faster rate in January after businesses spent 
more on industrial machinery, airplanes and other equipment.Investors will also focus on 
the monthly hiring figures from private payrolls agency ADP, which 
d plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. "shows that 
some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
 WASHINGTON  U.S. factories grew in January at the fastest pace in 
seven months, boosted by a rise in new orders. The report bolsters 
other data showing the U.S. economy started the year strong.The Institute for 
Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, says its manufacturing index 
rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 
indicate expansion.Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more 
machinery and other equipment. That has driven factory output. The sector has 
expanded for 29 straight months, according to the index.A measure of hiring 
dipped, indicating factories are still adding jobs but at a slower pace 
than in December. Export orders also rose, a sign that U.S. manufacturers 
haven't yet been affected by Europe's slowing economy.Manufacturing output has jumped in 
recent months. Auto sales have rebounded from the spring, when Japan's earthquake 
disrupted supply chains and fewer cars were availa
creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers
