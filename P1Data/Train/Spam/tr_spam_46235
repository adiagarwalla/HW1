<p style="font-size:xx-small;">own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
 eon sign at the Arizona-New Mexico border saying welcome illegals to your 
United States, my home is your home," he said.The government found that 
Arpaio's office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, 
including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic 
Constitutional rights. "We found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the 
culture of the department, a culture that breeds a systematic disregard for 
basic constitutional protections," said Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division.The report will be used by the Justice Department to seek 
major changes at Arpaio's office, such as new policies against discrimination and 
improvements of staff and officers. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for 
saying whether he wants to work out an agreement to make the 
changes. If not, the federal government will sue him, possibly putting in 
jeopardy millions of dollars in federal 
 e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.
