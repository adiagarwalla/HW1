I have to feed a family of 3 for 10 days on $65- what would you buy?
It's been tough recently with my husband unemployed for over 6 months, but t=
hankfully my paycheck lets us get by. Unfortunately, after paying the bills =
this month, we have $65
 left for groceries for the next two weeks until next payday. I plan to cle
an out my freezer, that will get us through 4 days. And we have cereal and p=
ancakes- enough for 2 weeks of breakfast. This will leave us needing 10 days=
 of lunch and dinner an
d $65 in the bank.

What would you buy to stretch the farthest? - I have pasta and rice, thankfu=
lly.

Eggs
Dry Beans
Tortillas
Frozen vegetables
Canned tuna

Look for sale proteins. Large packs of chicken thighs are usually very cheap=
 in my store and are very versatile. Sometimes ground turkey is BOGO -- also=
 a versatile protein.

Obviously look for sales on other items

Ramen noodles fortified with frozen veggies isnt the worst thing to eat for =
lunch.

It's doable!!

Dried beans. After you soak them and cook them, you can make a vegetarian ch=
ili, serve it over rice (you'll need canned tomatoes). You can also grind so=
me and add to ground be
ef to stretch the beef for hamburgers, meatballs, or meatloaf. If you can a
fford a whole chicken (or two--it takes just as long to roast 2 as it does o=
ne--I noticed Price Chopper has whole chickens on for $1.29/lb, but there mi=
ght be a better price a
t another store), roast the chickens, have chicken one night, use the bones
 to make stock and make a chicken soup/stew from the stock and some of the l=
eftover meat. Chicken pot pie out of the rest of the meat or chicken spaghet=
ti. Buy milk, peanut bu
tter, and eggs. You can always do scrambled eggs for "breakfast for supper.
" What canned goods do you have?

Check for fresh produce on the discount rack. You can make apples into apple=
sauce.

Good luck. And, if there is a local food bank, see if you can get some of th=
e staples there. That's what food banks are for--to help.

You already have the rice and beans and rice make a complete protein, so you=
 can skip the meat in meals with both. Buy some dried beans and cook them up=
 in a big pot or crock=20
pot with salt, onion & maybe garlic & use them for several dishes. Do you h
ave spices? If you like spicy, serrano chiles are usually pretty cheap. 1 or=
 2 would add some heat and flavor to a whole pot of beans and probably run y=
ou about 50 cents or le
ss. Serve beans and rice once or twice, blend some into refried beans & ser
ve in tortillas with rice & frozen fajita veggies, make some into bean soup.=
 Split pea soup is really cheap. Try to find ham on sale to add, or get a sm=
all container of ham ba
se if you like ham in your pea soup. If not use chicken stock/broth/base/bo
ullion. If you get a whole package of chicken thighs or legs like Jennyema s=
uggested, you can cut the meat off the bone, then boil the bones to make the=
 stock for your soup. Y
ou can also make chicken and rice soup with the stock. Onions, celery, and=20=

carrots are usually pretty cheap and add a lot of flavor when you're limited=
 on ingredients. Things like chicken salad, egg salad, and tuna salad are ea=
sy to make and fairly c
heap and tasty lunches. You can go lots of cheap ways with the pasta. Oil a
nd spices (if you have them already), make your own tomato based pasta sauce=
s, minestrone-type soup with chicken broth, frozen veggies, a can of tomatoe=
s, and some pasta.

You can add to them, left over chicken or even canned chicken, any leftover =
meat from the previous night, other inexpensive canned meat you can find on =
the shelves, shirred eg
gs, add a bullion cube or two and double the broth, if you use canned veggi

our and a good recipe, make your own pancakes. My kids always liked sugar o

make sandwiches with them by putting PB&J on one and folding it in half. I a=
lso have found over the
 years, by having the butter soft, they tended to use less when they spread
 the butter than when they cut off a chunk. Eggs, bread and potatoes can be =
spread to feed a family for at least two meals.

My mother was a child of the Depression and I was born at the tail end of it=
. So a lot of meals my mother made were the ones that kept her family going=
 during the Depression.=20
Save all trimmings for soup stock. Then toss all leftovers into the pot. Se
arch the market for bruised veggies. All markets have a section for them. If=
 there is no mold, then just cut out the bruised part, cut up and toss into =
the pot. collect all bo
nes from a previous meal, and as long as they haven't been gnawed on, toss=20=

them into the pot. Waste nothing. Keep the pot on a back burner with a low s=
immer and I guarantee you will have a soup that will wow your family. Happy =
Cooking!

I'd look for marked down turkeys or chickens etc. You can make several meals=
 out of one bird.

1 roasted
2 pot pie
3 hot turkey sandwich
4 enchiladas
5 soup
6 stew

One big birdie can feed you for a LONG time. And the stock will be useful fo=
r making other things with lentils, beans, etc. (See above posts for ideas)

I find a large ham is also helpful. Same sorts of things, but you can use it=
 for lunches etc.

Rice rice and more rice. Filling, cheap (usually) and can be combined with s=
o many things to make a filling meal.

In Costa Rica, the staples are corn, rice, beans and coffee and the prices a=
re regulated so everyone can eat. Use that as your guide and you should be a=
ble to do just about an
ything. Good luck and prayers for easier times ahead.

I am with Alix, look for a turkey!

Also a 10pound bag of chicken leg quarters is usually a good buy, FRESH eggs=
, a big sack of potatoes. If you are a baker I would also go with a bag of f=
lour and some baking po
wder, margarine etc...

I also agree on hitting the food pantry. Most of them will give you a three =
day emergency supply with no questions asked. Some will want to see a utilit=
y bill to verify reside
ncy. Check with them first and use the cash to fill in the holes.

Check with your children's schools to see about free breakfast and lunch on =
an emergency basis.

The biggest thing is to make the calls.

If no one knows they can't help!

Most bang for the buck...

1. 1 lb. pasta, a can of diced tomatoes, and a head of lettuce makes pasta w=
ith a side salad. You can feed a family of three for under $5 and have enoug=
h food left for reheate
d lunches the next day.

2. It costs 50-75 cents to make a loaf of bread from scratch. Buy an inexpen=
sive roast and make your own deli sandwiches.

3. As stated above, you simply cannot beat beans and rice for nutrition at v=
ery little cost. You can also make it many different ways. Some of our famil=
y's favorites are Mexic
an style black beans, pintos with canned pineapple chunks, or Cajun Red Bea
ns & Rice.

4. Eggs and fried potatoes.
