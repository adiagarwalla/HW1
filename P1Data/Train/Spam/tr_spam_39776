er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee 
g the slope as trees in its path were stripped bare.Family members, 
many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant

"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting

 MicrosoftThe biggest lawsuit in Microsofts history dominated the 90s, when the company 
battled accusations that it was stifling browser competition. Rival Netscape couldn't survive, 
but the Windows giant was ultimately forced to strip Internet Explorer from 
its operating system in a landmark ruling.That conflict may be brewing up 
again.Mozilla, the developer group behind the popular Firefox browser, argued Wednesday night 
that Firefox is being banned from certain versions of Windows 8, the 
forthcoming tablet-centric OS from Microsoft -- returning Windows users to the dark 
ages before competition.The upcoming release of Windows  and Microsofts browser practices 
regarding Windows 8 Metro signal an unwelcome return to the digital dark 
ages where users and developers didnt have browser choices, wrote Harvey Anderson,
