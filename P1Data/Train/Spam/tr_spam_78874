<p style="font-size:xx-small;">r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem 
 , area, told The Associated Press they spoke for about 15 minutes. 
"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting 
body langu
  as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the 
15,000-member Northland church in the Orlando, Fla.
