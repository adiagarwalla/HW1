 police had been looking for him -- and his body was 
first spotted by a police helicopter in the small lake.After divers went 
in to recover the body, a second corpse was discovered later that 
night -- that of another man aged under 25, who was named 
by Sky News sources as Daniel Lloyd.Police are investigating and post-mortem examinations

 preserve his testimony, given his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers 
said he no longer recognized Lynn and could not remember much about 
his own 10 grueling appearances before the grand jury in 2003 and 
2004."With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full 
truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president 
of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was 
born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian 
immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the 
Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.He earned a doctoral degree in canon law 
from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science 
from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's 
University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law 
in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court.In 1976, 
he was named chan
 is left is a heap of unfinished business that comes to 
a head at the end of the year: expiring tax cuts and 
painful across-the-board cuts to the Pentagon and many domestic programs. To top 
it off, another politically toxic increase in the debt limit will be 
needed at some point shortly after the November elections.The deficit would require 
the government to borrow 30 cents of every dollar it spends. Put 
another way, the deficit will reach 7 percent of the size of 
the economy, a slight dip from last year's 8.7 percent of gross 
domestic product.The report shows that the deficit dilemma would largely be solved 
if the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 -- and renewed 
in 2010 through the end of this year -- were allowed to 
lapse. Under that scenario, the deficit would drop to $585 billion in 
2013 and to $220 billion in 2017.But expiration of those tax cuts 
would slam the economy, the repoort said, bringing growth down to a 
paltry 1.1 percent next year.

however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much

 S., European Union, United Nations and Russia. U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon visited 
Jordan Tuesday en route to Israel and the Palestinian Authority in an 
effort to restart the talks."We must all do our part to break 
this impasse," Ban said. "In the short term, it is essential that 
provocations stop as called for by the Quartet and that the parties 
build confidence and sustain these nascent talks."The Palestinians have rejected Netanyahu's latest 
moves."They are adding obstacles at a time when everyone is intensifying efforts 
to try to resume peace talks," said Palestinian government spokesman Ghassan Khatib. 
"I think with every additional settlement activity, the feasibility of having two 
states is diminished."Years ago, the Israeli government halted generous financial enticements designed 
to encourage Israelis to settle in the West Bank, the occupied territory 
the Palestinians see as the core of their future state.But in this

Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department
