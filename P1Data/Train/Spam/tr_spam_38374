While I've only listed my favorite four items above, I've never been dissatisfied with anything that I've tried here. 23618170 My favorite thing to do in a group is to order many different dishes and share them family style. I've found it best to order one (meat) entree and 2 small side dishes per person (which is the amount they recommend), which puts me the right amount of "full" after a meal.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc

When I went here a few years ago with my Dad, 23618170 the food wasn't nearly as good as what I experienced when I went a few days ago with my Dad and Fiance. 

There were a few faults here and there, 23618170 but overall, especially given the fact that we got enough food for 3 for $60 that we still had some left to take over, it was a great experience. 

We ordered medium of the beef, 1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc medium of the pulled pork, 6 pieces of the chicken, sides of plantains, guacamole and creamed spinach. 

The beef was good. It was a bit less tender than I would have preferred, but definitely nothing to turn your nose up at. 23618170 The pork was incredible. Some of the best pork I've had in a long time. It was moist and flavorful (and I don't even like lime) and had just the right amount of salt. The chicken was cooked perfectly. It reminded me of the peruvian chicken that we get in DC. The skin was perfect, the meat was juicy, not dry, and the sauce they give you to dip it in was great. 

The creamed spinach wasn't the best preparation I've ever had, but it was still good. The jalapenos added a bit of a kick. 23618170 The plaintains were amazing. They were still soft and seared on the outside, so delicious. The guacamole was good, again not the most amazing thing we had there, but very good, just the same. 

The one thing that was slightly strange was the service. They seemed about one waiter short. The woman who was seating people was also handling tables, and they all appeared slightly out of sync. This resulted in us having to get our own water once or twice, but at least they had a big water pitcher we could use!1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc
