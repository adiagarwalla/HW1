shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of 
Americans barely get by. Or we can restore an economy where everyone 
gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays 
by the same set of rules," he said.Acknowledging his role as the 
"loyal opposition," Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, who delivered the GOP response, said 
the president "must know in his heart" that to project the state 
of the union as "anything but grave" is simply "not true," and 
he blamed the president's rigid adherence to ideology for suffocating innovation."The extremism 
that stifles the development of homegrown energy, or cancels a perfectly safe 
pipeline that would employ tens of thousands, or jacks up consumer utility 
bills for no improvement in either human health or world temperature, is 
a pro-poverty policy," Daniels said."We do not accept that ours will ever

convicted killers and another man who worked as trusties at the Governor's 
Mansion and were pardoned by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour during his 
final days in office.The Associated Press made public records requests for such 
documents, but state officials said Wednesday they don't have them on the
