 COCOA FROSTING

    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    2 tablespoonfuls of cold water,
    3 tablespoonfuls of hot water,
    ¬Ω a teaspoonful of vanilla,
    About 1 ¬æ cups of confectioners' sugar.

Put the cocoa in a small saucepan; add the cold water and stir until perfectly smooth; then the hot water, and cook for one or two minutes, add vanilla and a speck of salt, then stir in enough sugar to make it stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat until smooth and glossy and free from lumps.

If too thick, add a little cold water. If not thick enough, add a little sugar. Never make a frosting so stiff that it will have to be made smooth with a wet knife. It is better to let it run to the sides of the cake. For frosting sides of the cake, make a little stiffer.

This frosting never cracks as an egg frosting, but is hard enough to cut nicely.
COCOA SAUCE

    2 tablespoonfuls of butter,
    1 cup of boiling water,
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
    4 tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Melt the butter in the saucepan; mix the flour and cocoa together and stir into the butter; add gradually the hot water, stirring and beating each time; cook until it thickens. Just before serving, add the sugar, vanilla and a pinch of salt, if necessary.

Use more cocoa if liked stronger. This sauce will be found excellent for cottage puddings, Dutch apple cakes, steamed apple puddings, etc.
COCOA CAKE

    ¬Ω a cup of butter,
    ¬æ a cup of milk,
    1 cup of sugar,
    6 level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    3 eggs,
    2 level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    1 ¬Ω or 2 cups of sifted pastry flour.

Cream the butter, stir in the sugar gradually, add the unbeaten eggs, and beat all together until very creamy. Sift together one-half cup of the flour, the cocoa and baking powder; use this flour first, then alternate the milk and remaining flour, using enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon; add vanilla and beat until very smooth; then bake in loaf in moderately hot oven thirty-five or forty minutes.

Tests for baking cake. It is baked enough when:

    It shrinks from the pan.
    Touching it on the top, springs back.
    No singing sound.

COCOA MERINGUE PUDDING

    1 cup of milk,
    2 eggs (yolks),
    2 tablespoonfuls of flour,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    3 tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    ¬Ω a teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put the milk in the upper part of the double-boiler, and heat. Mix flour and cocoa together and soften in a little cold milk; mix until free from lumps. When the milk is hot, add the flour, and cook, stirring often, eight or ten minutes. Beat yolks of eggs lightly; add sugar and salt, and mix well. When mixture in double-boiler has cooked sufficiently, strain it over the mixture in the bowl. Put back in double-boiler and allow it to cook one or two minutes (stirring constantly), just enough to slightly thicken the eggs. Remove from the stove, and when cool add vanilla and put in the serving-dish. Cover with a meringue. Place dish on a board, put in the oven with the door open, and allow it to remain there for ten or fifteen minutes, and when the meringue will not stick to the fingers, close the door and let it brown slightly. This pudding can be eaten warm or cold, but is much better cold. This will serve four persons generously.
CHOCOLATE ALMONDS

Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling water on them, and let them stand two or three minutes. Roast them in oven. Dip them in the following recipe for chocolate coating, and drop on paraffine paper.

    ¬Ω pound cake of Walter Baker's Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    2 tablespoonfuls of boiling water.

Put chocolate in small saucepan over boiling water and when melted stir in butter and water. Mix well. If found to be too thick, add more water; if too thin, more chocolate.
HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE

    1 cup of boiling water,
    Pinch of salt,
    1 square of chocolate,
    ¬Ω a cup of sugar.

Cook all together slowly until it is the consistency of maple syrup, or thicker if desired. Just before serving, add one teaspoonful of vanilla. This will keep indefinitely, and can be reheated.
COCOA SPONGE CAKE

    4 eggs,
    ¬º a cup of sugar,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    ¬Ω a cup of sifted pastry flour,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Separate yolks from whites of eggs; beat yolks in a small bowl with the Dover egg-beater until very thick; add sugar, salt and vanilla, and beat again until very thick. Sift cocoa and the flour together and stir very lightly into the mixture; fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs, and bake in a loaf in a moderate oven until done.

Do not butter the pan, but when cake is baked, invert the pan; and when cool, remove the cake.
CHOCOLATE FROSTING

    1 square of Baker's Chocolate,
    Pinch of salt,
    5 tablespoonfuls of boiling water,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    About three cups of sifted confectioners' sugar.

Melt chocolate in bowl over tea-kettle, add water, salt and vanilla, and when smooth add the sugar, and heat until very glossy. Make the frosting stiff enough to spread without using a wet knife. It will keep indefinitely.
CHOCOLATE CAKE, OR DEVIL'S FOOD

    5 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    1 ¬º cups of sugar,
    3 ¬Ω squares of Baker's Chocolate, (melted),
    3 eggs,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    ¬æ a cup of milk,
    3 ¬Ω level teaspoonfuls of baking powder,
    1 ¬Ω cups of sifted pastry flour.

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0Terminus, a Terme, or Bound is here understood to bee that which doth either bound, limite, or end actu, in deede; as in the beginning and end of a magnitude: Or potentia, in powre or ability, as when it is the common bound of the continuall magnitude. Neither is the Bound a parte of the bounded magnitude: For the thing bounding is one thing, and the thing bounded is another: For the Bound is one distance, dimension, or degree, inferiour to the thing bounded: A Point is the bound of a line, and it is lesse then a line by one degree, because it cannot bee divided, which a line may. A Line is the bound of a surface, and it is also lesse then a surface by one distance or dimension, because it is only length, wheras a surface hath both length and breadth. A Surface is the bound of a body, and it is lesse likewise then it is by one dimension, because it is onely length and breadth, whereas as a body hath both length, breadth, and thickenesse.

Now every Magnitude actu, in deede, is terminate, bounded and finite, yet the geometer doth desire some time to have an infinite line granted him, but no otherwise infinite or farther to bee drawane out then may serve his turne. [9]

6. A Magnitude is both infinitely made, and continued, and cut or divided by those things wherewith it is bounded.

A line, a surface, and a body are made gemetrically by the motion of a point, line, and surface: Item, they are conteined, continued, and cut or divided by a point, line, and surface. But a Line is bounded by a point: a surface, by a line: And a Body by a surface, as afterward by their severall kindes shall be understood.

Now that all magnitudes are cut or divided by the same wherewith they are bounded, is conceived out of the definition of Continuum, e. 4. For if the common band to containe and couple together the parts of a Line, surface, & Body, be a Point, Line, and Surface, it must needes bee that a section or division shall be made by those common bandes: And that to bee dissolved which they did containe and knitt together.
