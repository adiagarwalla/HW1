We stopped at the bar before our reservation, and it took more than 5 minutes for the barkeep to even make eye contact, 11777592 but he was kind and helpful once he decided to acknowledge us (I think I won him over when he described The Great Divide Yeti as "motor oil", and I replied that it  sounded perfect and I'll take it--apparently girls only drink light beers out here, I hear??).  

Our server was attentive, but lacked enthusiasm, 11777592 and much of a personality, really. She immediately asked if there were any food allergies at the table, which I thought was kind of cool. We started with the sweet potato fries, as we were hungry, and we're having too much trouble narrowing down the options. The table thought they were good, but I currently live in the south, so I wasn't really impressed. My husband thought his tofu was "really good" and said that it was "nicely encrusted". The girls we were with shared diver sea scallops and meatballs, and thought both were fantastic. I started with the parsnip soup, which was the worst thing we ordered. It was topped with fried black quinoa, which I did not care for at all, and crispy butternut squash, which completely lost all of its flavor. 8934c72c411a6ed7d599be18d8f08ee8 I made the mistake of stirring it all together, and was disappointed with the weird mixture of textures. Absolutely would not order that again. I also had the Columbian Apresas (I think that's what they were called), which reminded me of the fried corn patty appetizer things from the Cheesecake Factory. They had a nice bit of spice and a bit of avocado, but I found them a bit too thin and a bit too tough. 

Overall, not too bad, and even good at times. 11777592 Complimentary valet parking was a nice bonus. Nothing about the interior spoke to me, and the red heat lamp on the side of the kitchen actually turned me off. I've been to many farm to table, local-fresh, put kale on the menu-types of places (isn't that what all the cool kids are doing these days?), and this just wasn't up to par with the norm.8934c72c411a6ed7d599be18d8f08ee8
