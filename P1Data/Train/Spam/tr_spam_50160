Fun fact: Vietnam consumes the least amount of sugar in the world... 21979496 tied with North Korea.

I took a Vietnamese girl here once... she wasn't so impressed. So therefore, I have come to the conclusion that she has 21979496 no idea about what she's talking about... ever. NEVER BRINGING HER TO EAT VIETNAMESE AGAIN!

Anywho, I like to think places like these are exactly what our founding fathers had in mind when they were you know, 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 inventing democracy. And capitalism. And robotic unicorns. And when Abraham Lincoln was freeing the slaves. Because if putting bulgogi in a Vietnamese sandwich isn't American, than I don't know what is.

It's definitely more fusion than it is 21979496 Vietnamese, which I can see why she was so lackluster about this place, but I didn't really care, as long as I get mine in (hehe, right guys?). But that's exactly why it's more popular than actual Vietnamese sandwiches. Because bulgogi is delicious! Kimchi fries are... delicious. Vietnamese iced coffee with your tripe is what? Delicious. If I could eat these all day, I would! Maybe with a shot of mayo too.

My favorite part? I can put a runny egg on everything. EVERYTHING! You can even put egg on egg. How's that for food porn?197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
