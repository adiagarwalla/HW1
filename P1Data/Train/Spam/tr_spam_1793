hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace
President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w

not happy," she said on Fox News. "When you pay dues, you 
think you're paying for a better work environment."SEUIs political action committee reported 
$70.4 billion in expenditures for the 2008 Obama campaign, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. And the union, which has 2.1 million members 
and is the fastest-growing union in North America, endorsed Obamas re-election campaign 
back in November 2011.SEIU will reportedly pay the rent for six months 
so Occupy protesters can plan demonstrations, workshops and continue to advocate for 
the 99 percent (of Americans) to have a say in returning the 
country to a just political and economic system.The union did not return 
a call to verify it is paying the rent.Occupy DC was essentially 
evicted in February from McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, 
for continuing to camp overnight on federal land. District officials ha

angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated 
on the issue within his own administration. "He,

win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop 
singer who is now a Broadway star. The fundraiser is for Obamas
