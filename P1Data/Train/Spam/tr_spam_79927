country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come

WAYNESBURG, Pa.  Police in southwestern Pennsylvania say a woman who appeared 
to not have any teeth in surveillance photos from a bank robbery 
last month has confessed, apologized and said she planned the heist because 
she needed the money for dentures.Forty-nine-year-old Evelyn Marie Fuller, of Carmichaels, was 
arrested Tuesday by police in Waynesburg, where she's charged with robbing the 
First National Bank on Jan. 20.The Observer-Reporter of Washington, Pa. (http://bit.ly/wPOQCm ) 
reports Wednesday that Fuller told a district judge she has mental health 
problems and lives on disability.After her arraignment, Fuller told a reporter, "I'm 
very sorry for what I did and I know God is going 
to punish me for it." Fuller says her pastor told her to 
tell the truth about what she did.___Information from: Observer-Reporter, http://www.observer-reporter.com
