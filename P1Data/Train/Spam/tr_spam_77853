he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives

work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> A 24-year-old West Georgia graduate student had to have her leg amputated 
after getting an infection following a zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTAAimee Copeland, 24, before 
the zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTADespite the odds of survival being "slim to none," 
Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student battling a 
deadly flesh-eating virus, is showing signs of recovery and is still fighting 
to survive."Aimee has made drastic improvements today," Andy Copeland, Aimee's father, told 
FoxNews.com. "Yesterday, she had some setbacks. She was really on the ventilator 
100 percent, but now she's only requiring 60 percent of the ventilator, 
and last night she moved her arms."Copeland also said Aimee's digestive system 
is showing signs of improvement, which the doctors told him is an 
extremely good sign."When you're in this state, your intestines can actually atrophy," 
Copeland said. "So you're wondering, 'Will her intestines actually work?' Well h
open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney.
