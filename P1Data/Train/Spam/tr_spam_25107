oman and a woman can be married, but a man can't have 
another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

your work, it brings your work into question.Is the Department of Energy 
to blame? The Climategate emails reveal correspondence only between Jones and his 
colleagues -- not between him and the DoE."Whats missing," Watts said, "is

wants that key. He recently filed Freedom of Information acts with the 
DoE, requesting the emails they exchanged with Jones."So far no administration department 
has bothered to respond, indicating they  believe the time bought with 
stonewalling might just get them off the hook for disclosure," Horner told

young girls in their underwear, according to the affidavit.Crain and Doby apparently 
met when she was a student and he was a professor at 
Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee between 1985 and 1987, Smothermon said. Although 
Smothermon did not disclose the nature of their relationship, court records show
