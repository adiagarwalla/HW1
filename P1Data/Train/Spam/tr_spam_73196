ReutersDec. 23: Demonstrators protest against Syria's President Bashar al-Assad after Friday prayers 
in Binsh near AdlbBEIRUT, Lebanon  The Arab League forged ahead with 
plans to send teams of monitors into Syria Monday even though President 
Bashar Assad's regime has only intensified its crackdown in the week since 
agreeing to halt bloodshed, killing several hundred civilians according to activists.At least 
20 more deaths were reported on Monday from intense shelling by government 
forces in the center of the country, just hours before the monitoring 
teams were to arrive. Activists said at least 275 civilians have been 
killed by government forces in the past week and another 150 people 
died in clashes between army defectors and regime troops -- most of

work Tuesday. Up to 500 monitors are to be eventually deployed.Anwar Malek, 
a member of the monitoring mission, insisted they will have absolute freedom 
of movement in Syria, adding that the team will travel to flashpoint 
cities including Homs, Aleppo, Daraa, Idlib and Hama. He and other observers 
refused to disclose the exact travel itinerary, saying they preferred to maintain 
some secrecy to ensure the mission's success.Assad stalled for weeks on agreeing 
to the Arab League plan and signed only after the League threatened 
to turn to the U.N. Security Council to help stop the violence.The 
opposition believes the authoritarian leader is only trying to buy time and 
forestall more international sanctions and condemnation.Amateur videos posted by activists on the 
Internet showed gruesome footage of at least four corpses lying in pools
