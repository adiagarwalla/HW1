Sony Pictures ClassicsRoman Polanski is a wanted man  and not just 
by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to 
get, John C. Reilly, star of the forthcoming Polanski-directed firm Carnage told 
FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a 
few months, thats not too shabby. And first off he was a 
really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he 
had a great BS detector. He could tell if something didnt seem 
organic or genuine. The man has been making great movies for the 
past 60 years now, so it was pretty amazing to watch someone 
like that work.Reillys co-star, the Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz, was also in awe.Getting

ded a tax break for 160 million Americans without raising taxes on 
millionaires and with the inclusion of provisions regarding Keystone XL pipeline. The 
legislation passed 89-10, but House Republicans say they oppose the plan because 
they want the tax cut to last 12 months and be paid 
for.Romney said he doesn't want to criticize everything the president has done, 
but his economic policies have made it "more difficult for this economy 
to reboot."He added that while the president gets the credit for killing 
Usama bin Laden and claims to have stopped another Great Depression, most 
of his rhetoric is "hollow.""With regards to Usama bin Laden, we're delighted 
that he gave the order," Romney said. "Any president would have done 
that."As for Newt Gingrich, Romney's chief rival in the GOP primary process, 
the candidate said that the point of the campaign is to point 
out differences, and his biggest differences relate to Gingrich's opposition to Medicare

Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came," Romney said. 
"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling, 
and he stepped out of the room and we stood up and 
hugged each other," he said.Romney said that wife, whom he met when 
she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school, 
had no energy, couldn't climb the stairs in the house and couldn't 
make dinner. They were trying to find solutions to make her day-to-day 
activities easier to manage, he said, but she was most concerned about 
not being able to take care of her family."I said, look, I

 The Second Mile fundraisers.Paterno, 84, led Penn State football for more than 
45 years until early November, when the sexual abuse charges against Sandusky 
shook the entire university and claimed the jobs of major college football's 
winningest coach and the school's president, Graham Spanier.Now, with The Second Mile's 
future in doubt, it is unclear whether Raykovitz properly handled the charity's 
response to the 2002 case.Penn State athletic director Tim Curley testified that 
a graduate assistant had told him in 2002 only that he had 
seen "inappropriate conduct" that made him feel uncomfortable, and nothing of a 
sexual nature. But Mike McQueary, now an assistant coach, testified to the 
grand jury that he told Curley he saw what he believed to 
be Sandusky raping the boy, who he said was about 10.Curley, who 
has been charged with perjury and failure to report a sex crime, 
testified he told Raykovitz of inappropriate conduct and that Sandusky was prohibited

PYONGYANG, North Korea  The man named the "great successor" to take 
control of North Korea in the wake of the death of Kim 
Jong Il, is a baby-faced twenty-something with virtually no public profile outside 
of his home country.Kim Jong Un, known only to be in his 
late 20s, has gained the little profile he has over the past 
three years -- as he has slowly been pushed forward as the 
man to take over from his ailing father.On Monday, that transition was 
seemingly complete, with North Korean state media reporting that the younger Kim, 
born to the late leader's third wife, was the "great successor" to 
his father."Standing in the van of the Korean revolution at present is 
Kim Jong Un, great successor to the revolutionary cause of juche and 
outstanding leader of our party, army and people," the country's official news 
agency said, referring to the official ideology of juche or self-reliance, AFP 
reported."Kim Jong Un's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditab
