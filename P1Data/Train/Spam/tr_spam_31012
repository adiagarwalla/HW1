<p style="font-size:xx-small;">ce company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of the 
Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid 
out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at 
the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips 
in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and 
eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell 
was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's 
car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell 
said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased 
night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we 
will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient 
for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final spree came after he 
stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from 
a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare foo
 aid.Deetman said abuse continued in part because the Catholic church in the 
Netherlands was splintered, so bishops and religious orders sometimes worked autonomously to 
deal with abuse and "did not hang out their dirty laundry."However, he 
said the commission concluded that "it is wrong to talk of a 
culture of silence" by the church as a whole.Bert Smeets, an abuse 
victim who attended the presentation of the report, said it did not 
go far enough in investigating and outlining in precise detail exactly what 
happened."What was happening was sexual abuse, violence, spiritual terror, and that should 
have been investigated," Smeets told The Associated Press. "It remains vague. All 
sorts of things happened, but nobody knows exactly what or by whom. 
This way they avoid responsibility."Archbishop Eijk said victims would be compensated by 
a commission the Dutch church set up last month and which has 
a scale starting at euro5,000 ($6,500) and rising to a maximum of 
euro
 100,000 ($130,000) depending on the nature of the abuse.He said he felt 
personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t
