Hello,

I am an executive officer from HSBC Bank in Hong Kong and have a sensitive and confidential brief from Hong Kong.
I am asking for your partnership in re-profiling funds ($18.350.000 Million)
i am contacting you because you live outside Hong Kong.
Finally, note that this must be concluded within two weeks.
Kindly write back and i look forward to hear from you so i can give you more information about myself and the nature of the funds.

Regards,
P.W
