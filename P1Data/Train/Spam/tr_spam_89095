they cook the meat through and keep it so tender with the tasty crust not burned is impressive. We all shared the toffee pudding which as tasty.  All in all the dinner was just fun.  The venue is just ultra nice and modern and the atmosphere frou frou.  Of course I had to take a couple of pictures of me knawing on the bone.  This is obviously after two Chimays so I take no responsibility for driving our dinner neighbors away.  LOL. I expected to pay a bit for such ambience and great service but I would not do this on the regular. I have an insane foodie crush on Bobby Flay's flavors, so this review may be colored by that fact. But hey, if you like Southwestern flair even a little bit, you cannot possibly go wrong with this restaurant. We ordered a ton of food. Most delicious and memorable was the lobster street tacos (three tiny little nuggets of heaven, and the pickled habanero relish on top was fantastic). Also delicious and memorable: my chile relleno (Who batters it with cornmeal batter and stuffs it with eggplant? Bobby Flay does. Swoon.), mom's sweet potato soup appetizer (silky smooth, perfect flavors), and the quesadilla appetizer. I got a white peach virgin margarita, too,
