Play to his senses


We've all heard the fact that guys are pretty visual people right, so why not 
take that away from him and see what happens? Bet the reaction will surprise 
you. 

 Nichi says: "Make him drop to his knees, blindfold him, and then walk around him 
in heels on a non-carpeted surface.

 http://www.hallde.com.au/creamiest Lean in to trail your hands and/or hair about his body, or tease him with a filthy 
remark from time to time - all the while he's there blindfolded. The anticipation of 
your presence will be intoxicating."

 The fact that's he's in such a submissive position, vulnerable to your every whim 
will be so unusual he won't know what to do with himself - in a good way of 
course.
