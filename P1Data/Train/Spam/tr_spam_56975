cing fashion. Romney lost in Iowa by a little and in South 
Carolina by a lot. But other than a couple of weeks when 
the Romneyites had visions of a January sweep, the frontrunners strategy had 
always been to hopscotch contests focusing on larger, more moderate states.So on 
the one hand, Romney is back on track. On the other hand, 
its a wholly different track than weve ever seen a Republican nominee 
follow before and with a very unpredictable GOP electorate.This isnt the NFL: 
you dont have to win all your playoff games to get to 
the Super Bowl. Romneys decisive drubbing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
in big, diverse and expensive Florida is the frontrunners strongest statement of 
dominance so far. Its also proof that while the Romney campaign has 
made some tactical errors in recent weeks, their overall strategy is holding 
up.But the truth is, we wont start to know until the end 
of this month whether Romney is making his strategy stick.There are a 
hand
d with the people of Syria and the region or become complicit 
to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc
d for restraint from both countries and later came down harder against 
Russia.White House Press Secretary Jay Carney on Monday also said Obama would 
"reconfirm U.S. support for the integrity of Georgia's territory," in a reference 
to those disputed regions.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">While President Obama will deliver another speech on the economy Wednesday in 
Northern Virginia to keep the focus on jobs, Catholic leaders across the 
country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come 
November.Catholics are fired up over new rules implementing Obama's health care reform 
law forcing Catholic universities, hospitals, and charities to provide insurance for their 
employees covering contraception -- even though that violates church teachings."When you push 
people of faith and you tell them the government is going to 
knock down the wall of separation of church and state and overreach 
like the Obama administration, you've got a war on your hands," Bill 
Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News.In an extraordinary move 
this past weekend, New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan and other archbishops throughout 
the nation had their priests read letters denouncing the Obama administration policy 
from the pulpit at Sunday Mass
 CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
