ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.
