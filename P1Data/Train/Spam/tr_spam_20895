1,000 miles easily. That is a pretty large puddle!The airplane has a 
legacy carrier logo name on it; is that who you work for?No. 
While regional jets often bear the branding of a major legacy carrier, 
we are often a smaller independent airline that operates under the banner 
of the larger carrier to provide flight connections and additional frequencies to 
their system of flights. These smaller airlines operate as subcontractors and have 
different safety prores, training departments, and management teams than the larger airlines 
although, all of this is governed by the FAA to insure everything 
is up to par.George Hobica is a syndicated travel journalist and founder 
of the low-airfare listing site Airfarewatchdog.com.Other articles in the series:Confessions Of A

hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi
ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force 
must now review the OSC report and promptly take appropriate action."Air Force 
Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and 
counter to Air Force core values."In an earlier investigation report released in 
November, OSC officials said they had found "gross mismanagement" at the Dover 
facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.

was told Monday that its conclusions support his and the others' claims 
of retaliation.
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
