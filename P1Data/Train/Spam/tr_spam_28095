occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index

to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc
s excoriated by black leaders as well as Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a 
white, openly gay Democrat.Newark Mayor Cory Booker said baseball great Jackie Robinson 
would not have had the opportunity to break the sport's color barrier 
had the matter been put to a vote, and the mayor himself 
would not have had the opportunity, years later, to be elected to 
lead New Jersey's largest city. Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said many felt 
the sting of Christie's comment.Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a titan in the 
civil rights movement, also came to Trenton on Monday to pound the 
governor."I've said over the years that I fought too long and too 
hard against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up 
and speak out against discrimination based on sexual orientation," Lewis said.But Christie, 
who blasted critics for suggesting that he misunderstood history enough to suggest 
that the civil rights movement of 50 years ago could have been

has been building over Iran's nuclear program. The West is imposing new 
sanctions, charging that Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran denies that and 
threatens to retaliate for the sanctions by closing the Strait of Hormuz, 
a vital oil passage.Click here for more from The Jerusalem Post.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.
 A new budget report released Tuesday predicts the U.S. government will run 
a $1.1 trillion deficit in the fiscal year that ends in September, 
the fourth year in a row over $1 trillion, though a slight 
dip from last year.The Congressional Budget Office report also says that annual 
deficits will remain in the $1 trillion range for the next several 
years if Bush-era tax cuts slated to expire in December are extended, 
as commonly assumed.The report is yet another reminder of the perilous fiscal 
situation the government is in, but it is commonly assumed that President 
Barack Obama and lawmakers in Congress that little will be accomplished on 
the deficit issue during an election year.The first wave of statements from 
lawmakers had a familiar ring as each party cast blame on the 
other."Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits, no credible plan to lift the 
crushing burden of debt," said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a 
Republican. "The president an

Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
