Bended Knee Sex Position
 A http://www.ubikhead.com/farrier variation on the Dancer position, the Bended Knee is also a lot of fun if you are looking for something with face-to-face contact. Both partners simply kneel facing each other, the receiver raises one of their legs over the giver's opposite thigh to give easier access while their partner helps support them.
