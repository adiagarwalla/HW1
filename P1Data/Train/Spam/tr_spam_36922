<strong>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;GIVING HOMEOWNERS A BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE!</strong><br />
<br />
The HARP refinance program was designed by the government to save homeowners thousands on their mortgage. Recently,<br />
the president has announced the decision to extend HARP into 2015 allowing more homeowners to realize their savings potential.<br />
Thanks to these new government programs mortgage rates are now hovering at an all-time low and homeowners are acting fast by taking<br />
advantage of their opportunity to refinance.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
