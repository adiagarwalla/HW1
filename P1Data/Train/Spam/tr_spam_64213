		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 17069297 food.  17069297 service is top notch as well. I had 17069297 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 17069297 size of 17069297 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 17069297 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 17069297 side, but I thought 17069297 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 17069297 spiciness of 17069297 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 17069297 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 17069297 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 17069297 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 17069297 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 17069297 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 17069297 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 17069297 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 17069297 portion was huge and 17069297 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 17069297 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 17069297 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 17069297 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 17069297 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 17069297 prix fixe meal and got 17069297 Tuna "tacos" to start and 17069297 crabcakes as her entree. 17069297 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 17069297 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 17069297 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
