<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Dec. 7, 2011: House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., second 
from right, accompanied by fellow committee members, gestures during a news conference 
on Capitol Hill in Washington.APHouse Republicans are moving to unravel the debt-ceiling 
deal struck last summer, pushing a proposal Thursday to spare the military 
from painful budget cuts that were triggered by lawmakers' failure to figure 
out how to tackle the deficit.The Pentagon faces more than $500 billion 
in budget cuts over the next decade, thanks to the failure of 
the so-called "supercommittee" last fall to agree on a deficit-cing plan. Non-military 
portions of the budget also face massive cuts -- this punishment was 
baked into the law, which allowed for the debt-ceiling increase last summer, 
as an incentive for Democrats and Republicans to strike their own deal, 
since the fallback cuts were so disagreeable to both sides.But even with 
this punishment hanging over their heads, lawmakers st
  accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
ays Retired Milwaukie (OR) Police Chief Larry Kanzler. Its the activities of 
the people who attend that location who have drawn attention to themselves 
by their activities.Jamal Tarhuni says he never met any of the Portland 
Seven or Muhamud. And as far as his trips to Libya, he 
says ever since he fled the country, he has protested against the 
Qaddafi regime.He hopes to be allowed to fly back in June to 
work with the new government in establishing a democracy that serves all 
the people.
