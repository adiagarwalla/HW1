osed financial terms -- with Sylvester Stallone, after maintaining that he was 
the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the 
long history of lawsuits. But the publicity surrounding the lawsuits does

in Pennsylvania earlier this week said he admitted his relationship with Crain 
and that he communicated with her via Skype and received photos of 
young girls in their underwear, according to the affidavit.Crain and Doby apparently 
met when she was a student and he was a professor at 
Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee between 1985 and 1987, Smothermon said. Although 
Smothermon did not disclose the nature of their relationship, court records show 
investigators found evidence of numerous "sexual chats" between the two on Crain's 
computer."Our community is distressed by the alleged crimes," Marty O'Gwynn, assistant to 
the president at OBU said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers 
are with the victims and their families."George Wright, an attorney for the 
families of some of the alleged victims in the case, said both 
parents and the children are "traumatized.""They're h
 ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA - Two men who murdered honeymooning British couple Ben 
and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly 
after being shot in the back of the head. Her husband, a 
physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.
APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans
