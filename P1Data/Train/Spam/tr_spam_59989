Now I am all about enjoying a well paced meal slowly but what is ridiculous is that we waited over an hour from the time we ordered until we got our entree.  We had arrived at 815 and did not get our food until 930pm.  11677576 For a good 30 minutes we didn't have any food and were just sipping on our drink and getting hungry and tired.  I'm not sure if this is common to wait this long or because we, as paying customers, have to wait much longer for our food because of the owners table's orders but that seems to be what the waitress insinuated.  11677576 We were actually getting a bit angry at this time as I wanted so much for this to be a great and special dinner and instead we are just sitting in our chairs for over 30 minutes between appetizer and entree wasting our time.3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">There are many reasons why this restaurant has garnered an almost perfect rating on Yelp. It's consistently fantastic.  11677576 We always have a delicious meal and great service here. The menu changes with the season and the dishes are unpretentious. It's a gastropub, so they have great comfort food here. They have a full bar, a great wine list, beers on tap and great coffee. This is one of our favorite restaurants and we keep coming back here because we trust that we will not have a bad experience. 

To illustrate just how wonderful this restaurant is, 11677576 I have to describe a dining experience we had here.  We came here for lunch after my husband had just argued on the phone with a customer service rep for flowers that were never delivered to me at work. As soon as our server seated us, she asked how we were doing, seeing that we were a little perturbed. We told her a brief version of what had happened. She was very sympathetic.  Sometime into our meal, she comes to our table and gives us a small bouquet of flowers in a glass vase (from the flower shop next door) to make up for the flowers I didn't receive for my birthday and wished me a happy birthday! Was that amazing or what? That really made our day! What restaurant does that???

On this visit, we came around 3:30 so they had a limited menu. 3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa I just really wanted to have a nice cocktail and didn't mind the limited menu.  The Last Word Cocktail was not on the menu, but the bartender made it for me. Yummy! My husband and I shared their Little Gem Salad with a sherry-tarragon vinaigrette. Dressing was great and the salad greens as fresh as it could be. We also decide to split the pastrami. They make their own pastrami and it's a nice balance of fat to lean meat. It's served on a La Farine baguette and comes with a savory slaw. Love the slaw too. It's not mayo based and its acidity is nice with the pastrami. Half is good for one. They are very generous with the pastrami! 

You have to get dessert here. 11677576 We have yet to eat the same dessert here.  Their dessert is always so good. We had the Cream Cheese Ice Cream Sundae. The best sundae I've had! The sundae came in a beer mug, and it had their own house-churned Cream Cheese ice cream, huckleberry compote and Rosemary Shortbread cookie crumbles. The sweetness was just right and the hint of salt from the cream cheese ice cream and the hint of Rosemary from the cookies made this dessert unique and delicious!3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa
