will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being

courthouse in Fort Meade, Md.FOR MEADE, Maryland  A military hearing for 
the Army private charged with spilling a mountain of secrets to WikiLeaks 
focused Sunday on why Pfc. Bradley Manning remained entrusted with highly sensitive 
information after showing hostile behavior to those around him.A supervisor who might 
have shed light on that question refused to testify, invoking his right 
against self-incrimination.On the third day of the hearing to determine whether Manning 
will be court-martialed on 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, his defense
