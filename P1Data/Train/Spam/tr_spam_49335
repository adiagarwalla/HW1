<p style="font-size:xx-small;">In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile

the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency

death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn
