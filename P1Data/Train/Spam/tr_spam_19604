One of my favorite places in South Reno. Great staff, nice environment and amazing food. I recommend the portobello ravioli they are awesome. 14977366 We have tried almost everything on the menu. Perfect for a date night or a group. I suggest ordering off the small big plate menu to try a variety of offerings. I don't suggest bringing kids. Espresso burger is great for an adult but my 12 year old boy didn't like it much. My daughter had the Mac and cheese but it is made with high quality cheeses not a box so she didn't care for it much. My only complaint is it's a tad bit over priced, however I always say great food and good service, I don't mind paying more.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This was just an outstanding venue for delicious Southern style cuisine, with a delightful and, evidently, ever changing menu, 14977366 and a great selection of well crafted cocktails.  

Kim and I were in the mood for some Southern, but nothing too coarse or heavy, as Southern style preparations can sometimes be.  14977366 We wanted quality not quantity, we wanted intimate, and we wanted provocative.  

Hungry Mother delvers on all fronts.

It's sits alone on the corner of Cardinel Medeiros Ave, a somewhat quiet and unassuming street, so we almost ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd didn't notice it until we were right in front of the place but once you walk in it is immediately inviting and warming to the spirit.  The place was humming.  A small but ornate bar, manned by a waxed mustached young gent, occupies the front room, with the clean, bustling kitchen visible behind it, and a few people were comfortably perched, clearly enjoying being at the bar, and not necessarily waiting for a table.  I liked that.

We were quickly greeted 14977366 and followed our hostess up some stairs into a warren of rooms decorated in light pastels with small pane windows all around and simple wood tables .  A very homey feel but clean and crisp too.  

Examining the menus I was immediately salivating.  Smoked clams and country ham?  Steak with Vidalias and Kentucky Worcesteshire?  Cornmeal crusted catfish with brown butter?  And deviled eggs!  I loved it.  I also loved that the menu was short.  One page.  Always a good sign, in my book.  

The menu this evening was presenting ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd a four course dinner but Kim and I only chose one appetizer and one of the entrees each.  It was enough, we thought, especially since having all four courses would turn out to be quite pricey -- cheap this place is not.-- but also from having experienced multi course dinners in the past that, although super tasty and fun, ultimately left us feeling soporific and listless from overeating.  

We ordered and sipped on a super well crafted Manhattan or two while we waited.  It was comfortable.  14977366 The room was busy but we would easily speak and hear each other despite the crowd.  A hard thing for a restaurant to pull off sometimes.   

Once the food arrived, we started off with a Charcuterie selection and the devilled eggs.  Both sinfully good.  Once the main course arrived, Kim tucked into her Catfish without delay, while I had partook of the Bevette Steak.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
