President Obama is consulting with allies following the death of North Korean 
dictator Kim Jong Il, whose reported weekend heart attack has catapulted son 
Kim Jong Un to power and could further destabilize the world's most 
isolated nation."This brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has 
seen little change in decades. South Korea's concern is warranted, frankly, because 
an insecure North Korea could well be an even more dangerous North 
Korea," a U.S. official told Fox News."The most likely scenario for regime 
collapse has been the sudden death of Kim. We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.South Korea's military and police were placed on a high 
alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an emergency national security council 
meeting.Nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea as part of a 
decades-long U.S. security agreement with that country. A Defense Departments sp

Press contributed to this report.FILE: North Korean leader Kim Jong Il salutes

 Korea had been a key outstanding demand from both the U.S. 
and South Korea of the North, which has tested two atomic devices 
in the past five years. Recent food talks in Beijing yielded a 
breakthrough on uranium enrichment, the sources said.The food aid announcement, which could 
have come as early as Monday, would have not only been welcome 
news for North Korea, but also pave the way for a crucial 
U.S.-North Korea meeting in Beijing on Thursday. That meeting in turn could 
lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that would also include 
China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and resuming them would amount to a foreign policy 
coup for the Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's 
lone ally China last week to discuss the issues. They were due 
to meet Obama's top national security aides on Monday to discuss the 
way forward. Those meetings will go ahead in the wake of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">spokesman Paul Browne said. The attacker sprayed Gillespie in the face and 
continued to spray her "sort of methodically" over her head and parts 
of her body as her bags of groceries draped off her arms, 
Browne said.Then, Browne said, the attacker pulled out a barbecue-style lighter and 
used it to ignite a rag in a bottle. He waited a 
few seconds as Gillespie huddled on the floor. Then he backed out 
of the elevator and tossed the flaming bottle in.Neighbors in the Prospect 
Heights building quickly reported a fire, but had no idea that a 
woman was being burned alive.Isaac, reeking of gasoline, went into a police 
station overnight and implicated himself in Gillespie's death, Browne said. The suspect 
told police he set her on fire because she owed him $2,000 
for some work he had done for her, Browne said.Jaime Holguin, who 
lives on the same floor as Gillespie, saw surveillance pictures of the 
attacker and said, "Oh, my God!"Holguin, the manager of news development
 . The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
, Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.
