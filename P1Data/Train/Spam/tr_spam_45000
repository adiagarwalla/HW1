  keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's. 
Dont get caught by the paparazzi after just having tried St. Elmo 
Steak Houses famous shrimp cocktail. It is impossible not to make a 
face, she cautioned, alluding to its spiciness.Indianapolis re
 ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the 
t he was going to kill someone hours before Gonzalez was murdered, 
Rabb told police.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a
 rogram and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We 
are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new 
evangelization, reaching out to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a 
telephone hotline began in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass 
and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, 
leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The 
five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing 
nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John 
Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did 
not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour 
days into his late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is 
constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and 
discussions," he said at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is 
delightfully hectic."He made a habit 
. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after 
midnig
