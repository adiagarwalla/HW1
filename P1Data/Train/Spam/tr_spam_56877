providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears. 
Youll truly feel like youre on top of the Buri Khalifa with 
Cruise.Hope youre not afraid of
WASHINGTON  A majority of Americans think President Obama should be voted 
out of office next year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The 
poll contained troubling signs for the incumbent as he prepares for a 
grueling reelection campaign. While Americans were evenly divided on whether they expect 
the president to earn a second term, most of those polled said 
he does not deserve one.For the first time, the poll found that 
a majority of adults, 52 percent, said Obama should be voted out 
of office while 43 percent said he deserves another termObama's overall job 
approval stands at a new low: 44 percent approve while 54 percent 
disapprove. The president's standing among independents is worse: 38 percent approve while 
59 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, the president holds steady with an approval 
rating of 78 percent while only 12 percent of Republicans approve of 
the job he's doing.Obama's overall poll numbers suggest he is in jeopardy 
of losing, even
 police. It was unclear how many protesters remain in military police 
custody.On his Twitter account, leading reform figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner 
Mohamed ElBaradei condemned the violence."If the sit-in broke the law, isn't the 
cruelty and brutality used to break it up a greater violation of 
all human rights laws? This is not how nations are managed," he 
wrote.The military took over after longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 
a popular revolt in February. Rights groups and activists charge that the 
military is carrying on the practices of the old regime, including arresting 
and beating dissidents.Protesters at the Cabinet building said the clashes began Thursday 
evening after soldiers severely beat a young man who was taking part 
in the sit-in.Hundreds of people rushed to join the protest after online 
video and photos showed people carrying the wounded man. The pictures showed 
his face and eyes bruised and swollen, his head wrapped in gauze 
and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
 ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra

protests, the military retains widespread support among many Egyptians who see it 
as the only entity able to run the country until presidential elections 
scled for next year.Images of troops protecting polling centers and soldiers carrying 
the elderly to the polls have served to boost the military's image 
as guardians of the country.
