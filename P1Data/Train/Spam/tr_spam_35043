 URGENT: Read This Before You Take Another E-ZPass Lane<br>
 <br>
 Dear reader,
 </div>
 <div>
 Last week, something crazy happened.
 </div>
 <div>
 I met with a CIA insider at a corner office in New York City.
 </div>
 <div>
 He began talking about a secret plan... one that could undermine America&#39;s financial system.
 </div>
 <div>
 A plan that&#39;s set to radically change the future of our nation.
 </div>
 <div>
 If this wasn&#39;t coming from a guy who has worked with the CIA, the Pentagon and 14 other intelligence agencies, I wouldn&#39;t have believed.
 </div>
 <div>
 After this plan comes into effect, our country will look a lot different than it looks today.
 </div>
 <div>
 For example, you won&#39;t believe how the government might end up using E-ZPass lanes.
 </div>
 <div>

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0Lorenzo watched his approach with terror; then, when he was close beside him, he cried:

"O my father, I have been a very great sinner!"

"The mercy of God is infinite," replied the monk; "and I come into your presence laden with the divine mercy."

"You believe, then, that God will forgive my sins?" cried the dying man, renewing his hope as he heard from the lips of the monk such unexpected words lover 178635c258a429a36327a01_7ffeba54 ".

"Your sins and also your crimes, God will forgive them all," replied Savonarola. "God will forgive your vanities, your adulterous pleasures, your obscene festivals; so much for your sins. God will forgive you for promising two thousand florins reward to the man who should bring you the head of Dietisalvi, Nerone Nigi, Angelo Antinori, Niccalo Soderini, and twice the money if they were handed over alive; God will forgive you for dooming to the scaffold or the gibbet the son of Papi Orlandi, Francesco di Brisighella, Bernardo Nardi, Jacopo Frescobaldi, Amoretto Baldovinetti, Pietro Balducci, Bernardo di Banding, Francesco Frescobaldi, and more than three hundred others whose names were none the less dear to Florence because they were less renowned; so much for your crimes." And at each of these names which Savonarala pronounced slowly, his eyes fixed on the dying man, he replied with a groan which proved the monk's memory to be only too true. Then at last, when he had finished, Lorenzo asked in a doubtful tone:

"Then do you believe, my father, that God will forgive me everything, both my sins and my crimes?"

"Everything," said Savonarola, "but on three conditions."

"What are they?" asked the dying man.

"The first," said Savonarola, "is that you feel a complete faith in the power and the mercy of God."

"My father," replied Lorenzo eagerly, "I feel this faith in the very depths of my heart."

"The second," said Savonarola, "is that you give back the property of others which you have unjustly confiscated and kept."

"My father, shall I have time?" asked the dying man.

"God will give it to you," replied the monk.

Lorenzo shut his eyes, as though to reflect more at his ease; then, after a moment's silence, he replied:

"Yes, my father, I will do it."
