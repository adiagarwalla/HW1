A Recent Harvard Study Reveals Alzheimer's Prevention Techniques

Review by January 13, 2015


alisonwithers@fs.net, 

I'm  Dr. Steven Klayman.  I recently discovered a new method that's helping 
my patients reverse up to 12 years of memory loss and mental decline.

This incredible prevention technique will help bring about the end of Alzheimer's disease and eliminate age-related mental decline. 

Let me show you how to wipe out forgetfulness and memory loss for good, here: http://goconnect.justavoidmentalloss.in



Never Forget,

Dr. S. Klayman

My second visit to Wood Tavern did not disappoint. 5249278 Arrived early and our table for 7 was already ready and hostess was able to seat us immediately. The non-preggos opted for cocktails - mine was gin-based and my face was feeling super warm after a few sips!!! 

Since I visited Wood Tavern before 5249278 I recommended to the table the crispy pork belly. While it was good, some of my friends were not impressed- it came on top of baked beans which I didn't favor. I don't remember it coming on top of baked beans when I visited last but who knows I may have been too tipsy from the cocktails to notice, LOL. The pork belly itself was perfectly cooked and satisfying. 

However, the main entrees were amazing!!! I had the duck- I don't even like duck but my boyfriend raved about it on our last visit so I decided to try. Oh my was it divine! Cooked medium rare it was so delicious.  I also tried the porkchops, seared scallops, and the ribeye off of my girls' plates - all so very good.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f
