ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further

NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
