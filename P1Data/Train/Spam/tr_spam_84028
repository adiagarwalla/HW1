<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APFeb. 1: Israel's President Shimon Peres, left, and United Nations Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon are seen reflected in a door's mirror as they speak 
at a Jerusalem hotel.JERUSALEM  The U.N. chief has told Israel the 
international standoff over Iran's suspect nuclear program must be resolved peacefully.Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon delivered his message at a time of growing concerns that Israel 
could be planning an attack on Iran. Israel, like the West, believes 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons and says no option, including force, can 
be ruled out in stopping it. Iran insists its nuclear program is 
peacefulAt a news conference with Israel's prime minister, Ban urged the Iranians 
to prove their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked whether 
he fears an Israeli attack, he said "there is no alternative to 
a peaceful resolution of these issues."U.N. nuclear inspectors said Wednesday they would 
soon return to Tehran after a "good trip" to the Iranian
  expulsion of foreign invaders from Afghanistan," the document continued.The report added, 
however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much 
cog
 JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.
