e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support

ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the 
commercial industry coming together to provide a capability built
