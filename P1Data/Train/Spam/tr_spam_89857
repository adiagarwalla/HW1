Dear Sir/Madam,

We have recently been given your details as a buy to let investor who
would like to receive related information and offers.

We publish the website Residentiallandlord.co.uk, which provides free
information to UK buy to let investors.

Our pages are free to access. They include news and features, links to
sources of information from Government and other agencies, and updates
on latest buy to let mortgage offers, auction dates and new property
developments.

Our Ask Sharon ‘agony column’ tackles some of the trickiest questions,

giving down to earth practical advice on a host of common and
not-so-common questions. Meanwhile our busy landlord forum buzzes with
daily exchanges on topics ranging from plumbing to taxation, worn
carpets to possession.

Our directory of essential buy to let services has over 40 categories
including landlord insurance, safety checks, landlord software, law
firms, landlord advice and letting agents.

We also have important information and documents to download, including
our much praised free assured shorthold tenancy agreement.
