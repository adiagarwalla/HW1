reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to

rights and political and religious dissenters. Convicted in 2006 of subversion and 
sentenced to three years, he was quickly released on probation before being 
taken away by security agents in 2009 in the first of his 
forced disappearances that set off an international outcry.The Xinhua report referred to 
his 2006 subversion conviction and said Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court 
found that Gao "had seriously violated probation rules for a number of 
times, which led to the court decision to withdraw the probation."The report 
did not explain what violations Gao had committed but said his five-year 
probation was due to expire next Thursday -- timing which legal experts 
said may have prompted the government to send Gao back to jail.

a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
 f economic development, hailed the deal and said Russia is ready to 
help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to 
monitor all trade be
n authorities because of a number of problems.These include concerns over who 
the money should be released to in Libya and whether it will 
be used for humanitarian purposes as required in some cases, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.
