ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA - Two men who murdered honeymooning British couple Ben 
and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly 
after being shot in the back of the head. Her husband, a 
physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.
 focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.
WASHINGTON  The last American prisoner in Iraq, a Hezbollah commander linked 
to the kidnapping deaths of four U.S. soldiers, was turned over to 
the Iraqi government Friday, the White House said.U.S. officials have long feared 
that such a transfer would lead to Ali Mussa Daqduq's release from 
prison. But his case became enmeshed in both international diplomacy and the 
Washington political debate over how best to prosecute suspected terrorists.Under President George 
W. Bush, prosecutors had planned to someday charge Daqduq in a U.S. 
criminal court. But those plans were scrapped after Obama took office and 
lawmakers began restricting the president's ability to bring terrorist suspects into the 
United States for trial.Many Republicans had wanted Daqduq prosecuted before a military 
tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba. The Obama administration had 
hoped a compromise would be to prosecute Daqduq in a first-of-its-kind military 
commission on U.S. soil.But the Ir

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at military police during clashes 
near Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, Egypt.CAIRO -- Soldiers stormed a protest camp 
outside Egypt's Cabinet building, expelling demonstrators calling for an end to military 
rule, just as officials were counting votes Friday in the second round 
of Egypt's parliamentary elections.The clashes underlined simmering tensions between activists and security 
officers and threatened to ignite a new round of violence after a 
mostly peaceful vote Wednesday and Thursday in an election considered the freest 
and fairest vote in the country's modern history.Clashes erupted as demonstrators were 
camped out in front of the Cabinet building, demanding that the country's 
military rulers transfer power immediately to a civilian authority. The sit-in was 
in its third week.One activist posted a photo online of a female 
protester beaten in the clashes, and others said they were briefly detained 
by military
  responsibility for the crime spree that brought him international notoriety.Harris-Moore said 
he studied manuals and online videos to teach himself to be a 
pilot, and the thrills he experienced while flying stolen planes renewed his 
passion for life and will help him rehabilitate while in prison."The euphoria 
of the countdown to takeoff and the realization of a dream was 
nearly blinding," he said of his first illicit flight on Nov. 11, 
2008. "My first thought after takeoff was `Oh my God, I'm flying.' 
I had waited my entire life for that moment."He said he'll use 
his prison time to study and get ready to apply to college, 
with the hope of earning an aeronautical engineering degree.He pleaded guilty to 
counts including identity theft, theft of a firearm and residential burglary.Harris-Moore's daring 
run from the law earned him international fame and a movie deal 
to help repay his victims after he flew a stolen plane from 
Indiana to the Bahamas in July 2010, cr
choose between two of the party's core constituencies: environmentalists who oppose Keystone 
and some unions who covet the jobs it would produce.But McConnell and 
other Republicans say the project would create thousands of jobs. The company's 
developer, TransCanada, says it could produce up to 20,000 jobs, while critics 
say the figure would be fewer than 3,500, including less than 1,000 
that would be permanent.After passing the catchall spending bill House leaders sent 
their members home until Monday or later, planning to return when the 
Senate produces a payroll tax cut measure for the House to vote 
on.The way was smoother for the compromise spending bill, which passed on 
a 296-121 vote. It would fund 10 Cabinet-level departments, such as the 
Pentagon and the Department of Education, and dozens of smaller agencies. It 
would finance everything from U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to veterans' 
services, and from airport security inspections to Congress' o
