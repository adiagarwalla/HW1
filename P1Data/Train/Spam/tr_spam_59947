Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But 13647952 tender meat and complex sauce compensated for 13647952 overly sweet bite. NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By 13647952 time 13647952 grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of 13647952 sweet dishes. But in fairness 13647952 "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, 13647952 sweet provides a gentle method for accepting 13647952 kick in many of 13647952 dishes.  There is a purpose behind 13647952 flavor selections. I appreciate 13647952 thoughtfulness behind 13647952 dishes.  What more could I ask? CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light. PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected. VERDICT: This was a lovely meal.
