Great place for lunch! It's literally across 8386627 the street from the projects, parking situation is dicey and some drunk person will ask you for a quarter while you're waiting in line, but worth it for the burgers! 

The extensive menu is right by the counter, 8386627 but let me just tell you to go ahead and order one of their burgers. Don't be sidetracked by the waffle, grits or taco. I mean a side of cheese fries are okay if you're splitting but save stomach room for your burger because you're gonna need it. 

The Jr. Burger is the size of a regular burger at other major fast food places. Just look at the multiple pages of burgers pictures on this Yelp page and prepare yourself physically and mentally if you order a double or the stomach stretcher Hawkings Special!.54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4
