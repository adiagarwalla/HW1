'Jersey Shore' stars JWoww and Snooki. (Reuters)"Jersey Shore" stars Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi 
and Jenni "J-WOWW" Farley are not welcome in at least one New 
Jersey city.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Tuesday on the city's website that 
a film permit request for a spinoff starring the two "Shore" guidettes 
had been denied.The decision was made "based on protecting public safety and 
quality of life concerns for Hoboken residents," Zimmer wrote.In a letter to 
Jim Bianco, one of the producers of the as-yet-untitled spinoff, she said 
he had a right to appeal the decision, but warned him against 
trying to film without permits as he had admitted to doing in 
another New Jersey town."I write to put you, 495 Productions, MTV and 
Viacom on formal notice that there will be zero tolerance for this 
kind of approach in the City of Hoboken," she said. "Any attempts 
to film in a manner that is not permitted without a permit 
will be dealt with immediately and aggressively."The ca
PHILADELPHIA  Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the retired head of the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia and an uncharged central figure in a child sex-abuse case that 
involves the alleged shuffling of predator priests to unwitting parishes, has died. 
He was 88.Bevilacqua died in his sleep Tuesday night   days 
after lawyers battled over his competence to testify at an upcoming trial 
   at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburb 
of Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon law, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese.In the days before his death, a 
Philadelphia judge had ruled him competent to testify if 
APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme
 ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt 
Romney is the man to beat in the Republican field.Romney has now 
won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and 
done so in convin
APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
