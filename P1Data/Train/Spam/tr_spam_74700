bobby brown and the old Kilkpatrick boys
i don't post often nowadays but i decided to go for this one that may int=
erest a few punters who treasure our history .=20

i visited Mr Bobby Brown not long after 90th birthday and he gave me a to=
ur of his home and a few hours of history on the famous Rangers fc .

Anyway a wee story he told me was about a group of bears he was closed to=
 , he calls them "the ole Kilpatrick boys" they'd come down once a year f=
or a visit a few haufs and a bite to eat while Bobby told them stories an=
d showed them pictures and articles on his career ,the good auld days so =
to speak.
Sadly Bobby said the group got smaller and smaller each year , i'm not ev=
en sure there are any left now at all or if they do if they still visit.

anyway at the time i had mentioned that i was sure a small group of bears=
 would love to come and visit to wish him well and hear his Glasgow Range=
rs story , to which Bobby thought was a grand idea.

sadly it was something i never got a round to doing but after a chat with=
 my brother i thought i would put the idea out on here , maybe 5-6 bears =
would be up for it .

The man's a legend and some of his "other"stories are really fantastic to=
 ,like i say its just an idea for a wee day out and making an old man hap=
py.
