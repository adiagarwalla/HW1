of the American public on how warmly or coldly they feel about 
a particular celeb.Using the scores, Levitt can objectively show that a Kanye-Kim 
Kardashian union would be unfavorable to the extreme.Levitt tells us that Kanye 
West has a positive Q score of 15. The average for personalities 
in the rap and hip hop community among Kanyes peers is an 
18. Thats not terrible. What is bad is his negative Q, which 
is a 58, where the average negative score for the rap community 
is a 40.While his positive rating isnt dreadful his negative is way 
beyond the average for the category, Levitt said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.The last 
time Levitts company ran the numbers on Kim Kardashian was in August, 
before her disasterous 72 day marriage to Kris Humphries further soured the 
public against her.My guess is the numbers would not improve if we

President Barack Obama and defending their own records in separate TV interviews. 
It was a shift from recent weeks where the two have attacked 
each other, trading accusations about each other's' records and the money each 
has made.In a rare appearance on a Sunday news program, meanwhile, Romney 
portrayed himself as the GOP candidate who is best able to defeat 
Obama next year. Romney defended his years making millions in private business, 
claiming he'll be able to handle attacks from Democrats who are already 
trying to paint him as wealthy and out-of-touch. And he argued that 
his tax proposal is kinder to the middle class and less generous 
to the rich than the flat tax proposals his rivals -- including 
Gingrich -- are backing."The president's going to go after me," Romney said 
on Fox News Sunday. "I'll go after him."Taken together, the pair has
