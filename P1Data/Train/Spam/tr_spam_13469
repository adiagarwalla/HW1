tic, and state authorities have not taken any actions since the call 
to "peacefully shut down" the caucuses does not amount to a crime, 
said Jim Saunders, director of the Iowa Intelligence Fusion Center at the 
state's Department of Public Safety.Unlike most presidential primaries, which are conducted by 
state governments, Iowa's caucuses are run by the political parties. On Jan. 
3, voters will gather in 1,784 precincts in Iowa's 99 counties to 
declare their preference for a candidate. Those results are then reported to 
the state party, where they are tabulated electronically and reported to the 
public on a website.Ryan Gough, the state GOP official in charge of 
coordinating the caucuses, said the party was taking steps to protect its 
election data, but declined to comment on specifics so as not to 
give away "the game plan" to hackers."The GOP is also encouraging the 
party activists who run the precinct votes to use paper ballots instead 
of a show of hands, whi
gned in early voting South Carolina, where tea party activists have given 
Gingrich a strong lead in polls. Romney told reporters that many voters 
now are just beginning to pay attention to the race and will 
turn on Gingrich after they learn about his time in Washington and 
his role with mortgage company Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency.Gingrich's consulting firm 
collected $1.6 million from the company."I think as tea partiers concentrate on 
that, for instance, they'll say, `Wow, this really isn't the guy that 
would represent our views,"' Romney said after a town hall meeting with 
South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott. "Many tea party folks, I believe, are 
going to find me to be the ideal candidate."Gingrich said the attacks 
on his record have been brutal, but he insisted they are exaggerated."I 
just want to set the record straight," Gingrich told Iowa supporters. "We 
were paid annually for six years, so the numbers you see are 
six years of work. Most of that mon
 information on whether he had an attorney.Residents were evacuated and kept 
away from the six-story building for hours Saturday night as police investigated. 
On Sunday, Holguin said, the fifth floor was a mess, with a 
melted elevator door and a layer of water on the floor.Holguin said 
he and his girlfriend had taken the elevator on their way out 
of the building shortly before the attack. They didn't see anyone on 
the floor with them but did notice an odd smell, as if 
someone was painting, he said.Holguin said police told them later that the 
assailant was already in the building and perhaps had hidden on another 
floor when they left their apartment.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were both briefed on Kim's death, 
the White House and State Department said.South Korea's military and police were 
placed on a high alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an

a "special broadcast" from Pyongyang late Sunday. The report said Kim died 
of a heart ailment on a train due to a "great mental 
and physical strain" on Dec. 17 during a "high intensity field inspection." 
North Korea will hold a national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's 
funeral will be held on Dec. 28, it said.The U.S. officials stressed 
that North Korea's past behavi

Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean

Despite Playboy's hype, there was nothing particularly shocking or new about this 
shoot. While these shots may have been slightly closer to full frontal 
than Lindsay's previous shots, they weren't actually full frontal; there was also 
nothing particularly new about Lindsay dressing up as Marilyn Monroe, says Lux 
Alptraum, editor of Fleshbot.com.I thought the shots were really boring and didn't 
really live up to the promises Playboy had made," Alptraum added. "If 
they'd actually gotten full frontal shots of Lindsay, or come up with 
a fresher, more interesting concept, there might have been more demand for
