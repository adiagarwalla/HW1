s.com. Variances in temperature, humidity and light continue to age the parchment, 
so there are strict rules about how much time the documents can 
be illuminated. The last time the Ten Commandments scroll was exhibited in 
Toronto, Canada, in 2009, it was restricted to just 80 hours of 
public viewing.Tatiana Treiger, a conservator with the Israel Antiquities Authority, is personally 
handling the installation of the scroll and will watch over it during 
its time in New York. "Our job is a lot like a 
doctor's: do no harm," Treiger said.The story of how the Ten Commandments 
were conveyed to Moses by God on stone tablets is not recorded 
in this scroll. The stone tablets themselves were supposedly held in the 
Ark of the Covenant, as famously depicted in Hollywood movies, such as 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.Somewhat less spectacularly, the scroll is simply a 
copy of those commandments. But its very existence -- the scroll dates 
from about 30 B.C. and survived for thousand
Dec. 15, 2011: Villagers hold placards chanting slogans as they march around 
their village during a protest in Wukan village, in China's Guangdong province. 
A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death in police 
custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's farewell Friday 
as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his sacrifice for 
them.BEIJING -- A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death 
in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
s request.When contacted by FoxNews.com, DoE spokesman Damien LaVera declined to comment.However, 
climate change researcher and blogger Steve McIntyre forwarded FoxNews.com an email exchange 
from 2005 in which climate scientist Warwick Hughes asked an official at 
a DOE lab if he could get the data that the government 
paid Jones to collect."I am asking you to provide me with the 
following data  DoE has been funding [the data] since the 1980s," 
Hughes noted in his request.But Tom Boden, of the DOE's Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, told Hughes at the time that the DOE itself did 
not have the data, and that "you will need to contact Phil 
[Jones] directly. I spoke today with the DOE program manager who indicated 
Phil was not obligated under the conditions of past or present DOE 
proposal awards to provide these items."McIntyre said he himself later had a 
similar exchange with the DOE, after which "I suggested that they amend 
this as a condition of further financing."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">COUPEVILLE, Wash.  The 20-year-old "Barefoot Bandit" was sentenced Friday to more 
than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of charges.Colton 
Harris-Moore gained international notoriety while evading police across America in stolen planes, 
boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.Judge Vickie Churchill said "this 
case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of 
the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a 
"mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and 
contrite.Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington state counties. He 
has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be 
sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state 
and federal sentences at the same time.In a statement provided to Judge 
Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on 
his "darkest enemies."Still, he said he takes
 lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine
