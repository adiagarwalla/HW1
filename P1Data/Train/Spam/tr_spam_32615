APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the 
toral degree in canon law from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a 
master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a 
law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he 
was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never 
argued in a court.In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn 
Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary 
bishop of Brooklyn.He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its 
Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed 
him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.___Associated Press Writer Ron Todt contributed 
to this report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
 in South Florida, but it does lend some credence to his campaign 
strategy that with a lot of delegate-rich southern states to vote next 
month, Gingrich has time to wait for the next gust of wind 
to fill his sails.Florida certainly narrowed Gingrichs chances, but it certainly didnt 
end them. Weve got at least five more crazy weeks to go.Chris 
Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY 
column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.-- Power Play, the political note, will be 
on hiatus for the remainder of this week. Power Play with Chris 
Stirewalt, will be guest hosted both days at 11:30 Eastern by the 
hosts gracious FOX News colleagues.
 is left is a heap of unfinished business that comes to 
a head at the end of the year: expiring tax cuts and 
painful across-the-board cuts to the Pentagon and many domestic programs. To top 
it off, another politically toxic increase in the debt limit will be 
needed at some point shortly after the November elections.The deficit would require 
the government to borrow 30 cents of every dollar it spends. Put 
another way, the deficit will reach 7 percent of the size of 
the economy, a slight dip from last year's 8.7 percent of gross 
domestic product.The report shows that the deficit dilemma would largely be solved 
if the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 -- and renewed 
in 2010 through the end of this year -- were allowed to 
lapse. Under that scenario, the deficit would drop to $585 billion in 
2013 and to $220 billion in 2017.But expiration of those tax cuts 
would slam the economy, the repoort said, bringing growth down to a 
paltry 1.1 percent next year.
