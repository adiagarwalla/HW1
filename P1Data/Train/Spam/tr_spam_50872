If I'd had to describe Da Pasquale, I would say that it's like God has opened a restaurant and decided to cook for us! Seriously, this restaurant is divine and their menu is one of the best in town. 23867228 First time I came here, it was a weekend night, and even though the place was busy, it was not annoying, as the atmosphere was friendly and positively vibrant.

Even though this place is quite small, it has an open kitchen, which enlarges the space a little bit. In the summer, 23867228 there is also an outdoor patio, where I usually like to sit. I like the fact that you can actually see the chef cooking. This way you know that everything is fresh.

All 5 stars for the service and 23867228 10 stars for the food. Really, it's AMAZING! I tried the shrimp and calamari salad and I was given a large portion. Both the shrimps and calamari were tender and delicious. Next, we stopped at the Lasagna Napoletana and Spagetthi alla pescatora.  Simply DE-LI-CI-OUS!!! It's some of the best food that we've had in a restaurant. I am not able to say which one was better, but I would probably go for the Lasagna which was enriched with a great amount of cheese, marinara sauce and tiny meatballs.8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a
