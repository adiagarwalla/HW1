Not great, but not bad. 11032530 This is our second visit to The Pantry this year and it hits on some levels and misses on others.

HITS: Fast service and friendly staff. 11032530 Food was hot and prepared in relatively little time from the moment we ordered. The pantry fries were done well, the eggs were done perfectly, and my wife said the Carne Adovada was really good. The green chili was adequate.

MISSES: As noted by other reviewers the biscuits and gravy are not house made, they are pre made by some factory. That is a shame for they have no flavor. NONE. It's just congealed white stuff with something resembling meat floating in it and the biscuits are severely subpar. It is my opinion that if the Pantry had some signature B-n-G it would be a much more satisfying meal, but that may slow their whole pace of feeding people and getting them out the door (because then you would have to put effort into that food item).c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
