nt moderate who would get marginalized in the general election. This time, 
Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more 
fire, but the message is the same: Stop this charging RINO.So, while 
Romney can count on some of the same Florida supporters who backed 
his 2008 bid, particularly Northeastern transplants and businessmen looking for someone to 
be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If 
Romneys week of blistering high-dollar, high-frequency attacks on Gingrichs character have hurt 
enough, conservatives unable to vote for the more moderate former Massachusetts governor 
but anxious 
PHILADELPHIA  Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the retired head of the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia and an uncharged central figure in a child sex-abuse case that 
involves the alleged shuffling of predator priests to unwitting parishes, has died. 
He was 88.Bevilacqua died in his sleep Tuesday night   days 
after lawyers battled over his competence to testify at an upcoming trial 
   at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburb 
of Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon law, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese.In the days before his death, a 
Philadelphia judge had ruled him competent to testify if 
 Iran has decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Clapper said he 
does not think they have."But they are certainly moving on that path," 
he added. "But we don't believe they've actually made the decision to 
go ahead with a nuclear weapon."Clapper said that decision would be based 
on a "cost-benefit analysis" by Khamenei, "and the extent to which he 
thinks that would benefit the state of Iran, or conversely not benefit."The 
Iranian regime has opened its country up to nuclear inspectors, though it 
is unclear what Iran's intentions are after a rash of heightened rhetoric 
from top Iranian officials.Iran's foreign minister on Monday reportedly offered to let 
United Nations inspectors extend their stay in the country.Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said, exclusively told Fox News that Iran is seeking a way 
out of U.S.-led sanctions against the country. The sultan, who has acted 
as an intermediary with Iran, said the country understands that returning to 
talks with the

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

would help build support on Capitol Hill and address critics who ask 
why the government is helping people who borrowed more than they could 
afford.Click here to read more from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).
