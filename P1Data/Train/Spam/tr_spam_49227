OWN/Jenny Craig/YoutubeMariah Carey went on Rosie O'Donnell's show to talk about her 
weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains 
Richard Zeeb, the former Chief Marketing Officer for the diet company Medifast, 
currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers 
and nutrion
tarted sinking in the choppy water.One of the survivors, Sergei Grauman, said 
on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia 
is the world's largest natural gas exporter and second-largest oil export
 contacted at Pyongyang's Koryo Hotel said hotel staff were in tears.Asian 
stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth 
heralded in the heavens by a p

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">e Senate bill a bipartisan compromise. It passed 89-10."We're not coming back," 
said a Democratic aide. "They should pass the two-month, and we start 
negotiating the year-long. Remember, this is the two-month (Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell 
negotiated."However, the Senate has not adjourned for the year, and remains in 
will be in pro-forma sessions, which are designed to meet the constitutional 
requirement that if they don't adjourn, they meet every few days. Making 
a return more complicated is the approval needed from all 100 senators 
to let the Senate hold any votes before the chamber's late January 
return.Without congressional action, the payroll tax would rise 2 percentage points on 
Jan. 1 -- a boost that Democrats eagerly said would be the 
GOP's fault. The brinksmanship is a familiar pattern this year between the 
two parties, who have narrowly averted a federal default and several government 
shutdowns in past fights.Extending the payroll tax cut and jobl

toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing 
the recomme
 is warranted, frankly, because an insecure North Korea could well be 
an even more dangerous North Korea."South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said 
Monday that the South had also completed the deployment of its indigenous 
guided missile, Yonhap reported.Cross-border tensions have been high since Seoul accused Pyongyang 
of torpedoing a warship off the east coast of the peninsula with 
the loss of 46 lives in March 2010. The North denied the 
charge but went on to shell the Yeonpyeong border island, briefly sparking 
fears of war.Since then, Seoul has staged a series of military exercises 
either alone or jointly with its ally the US in a show 
of force, while Pyongyang routinely test fires short-range missiles either as part 
of a training exercise or as a reaction to political developments.NewsCore and 
Fox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.
