e 2008 presidential campaign that he believes marriage is between a man 
and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances 
to argue that he's in favor of gay rights -- without putting 
the president on record for or against gay marriage.Obama, in additional segments 
from the ABC interview, noted that much of the debate is "generational," 
saying his daughters have friends whose parents are same-sex couples."It doesn't make 
sense to them" that their friends parents "would be treated differently," Obama 
said.He and first lady Michelle Obama are practicing Christians, he said, "and o
when a zip lining accident went from bad to much, much worse. 
Just one week ago, Aimee was enjoying a trip kayaking down a 
creek with some of her friends in Carrollton, Ga. But when she 
stopped to ride on a homemade zip line along the water, the 
line snapped and cut a large gash in her left calf.Initially, Aimee 
had gone to the emergency room at the Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton on Tuesday after she had received the gash. She thought the 
ordeal was over after the doctors stapled her leg up with 22 
staples and told her to take pain medication, according to her father.But 
Aimee returned to the hospital Wednesday after she continued to complain of 
severe pain in her leg. She was prescribed pain killers and sent 
home yet again.The pain still did not subside, so a friend drove 
a pale and weak Aimee to Tanner Medical again Friday morning. When 
she arrived, an ER doctor diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis  a 
flesh-eating bacteria disorder of the deep la

shops to report the sale of multiple rifles or long guns. Demand 
Letter 3 was so-named because it would be the third ATF program 
demanding gun dealers report tracing information. (VIDEO: Chaffetz to Dems on Fast 
and Furious: Have guts to take on Holder)Democratic politicians have also invoked 
Fast and Furious when pushing for stricter gun control laws. During an 
early November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
tried to leverage the crisis to push for anti-gun regulations.My concern, Mr. 
Chairman, is theres been a lot said about Fast and Furious, and 
perhaps mistakes were made, but I think this hunt for blame doesnt 
really speak about the problem, Feinstein said during a Nov. 1 hearing. 
And the problem is, anybody can walk in and buy anything: .50-caliber 
weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts and send them down 
to Mexico. So,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that
