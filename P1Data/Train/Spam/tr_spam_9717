rogram and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We 
are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new 
evangelization, reaching out to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a 
telephone hotline began in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass 
and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, 
leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The 
five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing 
nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John 
Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did 
not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour 
days into his late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is 
constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and 
discussions," he said at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is 
delightfully hectic."He made a habit 
et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for 
Lili an
 ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer
about Gingrich may opt to lodge protest votes with former Pennsylvania Sen. 
Rick Santorum.As voters in a winner-take-all state, Florida Republicans know that only 
first place really matters and may more quickly flee a candidate they 
perceive as flawed if he or she doesnt look viable.A better-than-expected showing 
for Santorum, who has been polling around 13 percent, would be one 
of the best signs of an impending romp for Romney. In 2008, 
second-tier Florida candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul took 31 
percent of the vote. If Santorum and Pauls combined statewide vote share 
approaches that number, Gingrich will be in big trouble.Money MattersPart of what 
is driving the change in the Florida electorate is frustration with one 
of the hardest economic falls in the nation.When voters were going to 
the polls in 2008, Floridas unemployment rate was 4.6 percent, the same 
as the nation overall, and had been lower than the national average
