MIDDLETOWN, Conn.  A Massachusetts man was found not guilty by reason 
of insanity Friday in the 2009 shooting death of a Wesleyan University 
student after a trial that portrayed him as anti-Semitic and mentally ill 
as he stalked and harassed the young woman.A three-judge panel agreed with 
the defense for 32-year-old Stephen Morgan, and ordered a psychiatric report. The 
judges will commit Morgan to Connecticut's maximum-security psychiatric hospital for the criminally 
insane, most likely after receiving the report in February.Morgan, of Marblehead, Mass., 
was charged with murder and other crimes in the May 2009 death 
of 21-year-old Johanna Justin-Jinich. The college junior from Timnath, Colo., was shot 
seven times while working at a bookstore cafe near the liberal arts 
school in Middletown.During the trial, Morgan rocked back and forth as he 
sat at the defense table. But he sat motionless Friday as the 
verdict was read. His lawyer said afterward that he would now
APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."
  there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th

a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau 
for Statistics, 29 percent of the Dutch population of 16 million identified 
themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the 
country.
