ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
 2001 portrayal of James Dean, acted like a rebel without a 
clue in his other courses, too, blowing off just as many classes. 
But the stars other professors at NYUs Tisch School of the Arts 
still gave him good grades, Santana said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.Big names such 
as Francos typically translate into big bucks for universities.After his student gig, 
Franco, 33, wound up teaching an NYU course this past fall on 
adapting poetry into short films.Santana suggested that the good grades Franco received 
were payback to the actor for hiring one of his other professors, 
Jay Anania.Franco hired Anania to write and direct the film William Vincent, 
which starred Franco, the suit states. The film was featured at the 
2010 Tribeca Film Festival.Click here to read the full report from the
