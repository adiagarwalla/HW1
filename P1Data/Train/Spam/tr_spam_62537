A list of major suicide bombings and large-scale explosions during Syria's 14-month 
uprising:  Dec. 23, 2011    Two car bombers blow 
themselves up near intelligence agency compounds in the capital Damascus, killing 44 
people in the first suicide attacks since the uprising began in March. 
 Jan. 6, 2012    Two weeks later, another suicide 
explosion rips through a busy intersection and a police bus in the 
capital's Midan neighborhood, killing 26 people.  Feb. 10, 2012   
 Two suicide car bombers strike in the northern city of Aleppo, 
Syria's largest, killing 28 people near a military intelligence building and the 
barracks of security forces.  March 3, 2012    A 
suicide car bomb explodes at a roundabout in Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising, killing at least two people in the first suicide attack 
in an opposition stronghold.  March 17, 2012    Three 
suicide bombings in Damascus kill at least 27 people, two of them 
near-simultaneous suicide car bomb attacks on
t that killed 35 people.Authorities said the terrorists were planning to smuggle 
the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press. 
"They're always trying to accuse Georgia and its secret se
Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National

from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines

fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry

her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up
