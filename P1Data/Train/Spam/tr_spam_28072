survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h

0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell

deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are

added that he went to Minnesota because the state's primary results matter."People 
are going to go out to vote. People are always looking at 
what the polls say. The best poll is folks you know in 
one of the most important states in the country in the general 
election is going to speak, and they're going to speak very loudly, 
and that's why I was in Minnesota."The strategy is not far from 
rival Ron Paul's, who is also concentrating his energy outside of Florida, 
appearing Tuesday in Ft. Collins, Colo., as well as Denver, where a 
raucous crowd cheered on the Texas congressman.Paul told Fox Business Network on 
Monday that he doesn't get the same media coverage as the other
