riveted by the sight of their ailing former ruler of nearly 30 
years lying in a hospital bed inside the courtroom's cage, where defendants 
traditionally sit during trials in Egypt.During early sessions, the trial was bogged

attacking me for serial hypocrisy and he spent 10 years earning money 
out of a newsletter that had his name, that he didn't notice," 
Gingrich said on CNN. "Now all I'm saying is I think he's 
got to come up with some very straight, very straight answers to
