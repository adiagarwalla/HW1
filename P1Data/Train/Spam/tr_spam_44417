GOOD DAY TO YOUR AND YOUR FAMILY

I am sure this mail would be coming to you as a surprise since we have never met before and you would also be asking why I have decided to chose you amongst the numerous internet users in the world, precisely I cannot say why I have chosen you but do not be worried for I come in peace and something very positive is about to happen to your life right now and to the lives of others through you if only you can carefully read and digest the message below. The internet has made the world a global village where you can reach anybody you have not met before.

Before I move further, permit me to give you a little of my biography, I am Mother Jane milne Robert, 72 Years old woman and the wife of Late Sir Moses Anna who died in a Plane crash on Monday the 7th of September 1999 GMT 14:22 UK while they were flying from New York to Geneva. Please see site below for more information.

http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9809/swissair.victims.list/index.htm

After the death of my husband I became the Head of his investment and now that I am old and weak I have decided to spend the rest of my life with my family and loved ones whom I never had time for during the course of my business life, but before the death of my husband we had a plan to use the last days of our lives to donate half of what we have worked for to the less privilege and charity homes and the other half for ourselves, family members and close friends, and it is so unfortunate that my husband is not alive today to do this with me and I am very weak and old now, hence I have decided to do this philanthropic work on behalf of my late husband and I.
Presently, I have willed out almost half of our assets to several charity homes and to some of the less privilege in different countries.
Despite the agreement between my late husband and I to give aid to the deprived, we also agreed to render support to an individual we have not meet before in life due to the fact when we were still young in life we receive an anonymous help from an individual we did not know and which we have not being able to know or met again till date, the impact we got from such gestsure made us wabt to do same.

I am sorry to inform you that you will never have the chance to know me because I have just concluded the assignment which my husband and I have agreed upon before his sudden death and you happened to be the beneficiary of our last WILL, irrespective of your previous financial status, hence I need you to do me a favor by accepting our offer that will cost you nothing.I have presently deposited a Cheque in the sum of $5.5million with DHL express to deliver to you when i visited west Africa to conclude some unfinished transaction and investment on behalf of my late husband,So i have contacted the ATTORNEY in charge of the deposited cheque which i left there so that he can go to the DHL delivery company there to know when they will deliver the cheque package to you because of the expiring date.

For your information, I have paid for the delivering Charge, Insurance Premium and Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque showing that it is not a Drug Money or meant to sponsor Terrorist attack in your Country
You have to contact the DHL COURIER SERVICE now for the delivery of your cheque with this information bellow;

dhl address: DHL International Nigeria Ltd DHL House ABUZE ABUJA
Contact Person: Mr Fred Gary
Email:fred_gary@aol.com

Again, you are not to pay for the delivering Charge, the Insurance premium and the Clearance Certificate Fee of the Cheque because I have already paid for them, the only money you are expected to pay is $180 for the security keeping & intuity fee of the cheque so far.

I would have paid the fee but the company insisted that I should not because they don't know when you will be contacting them and to avoid demurrage or further cost.

You are to reconfirm the below information to them to avoid any mistake on the Delivery.

Your Postal / delivery address;
Your Full Names:
Direct telephone number;

Below is the security keeping code: (FED/0433/SKC) of you draft, you are to also present it to them for verification before delivery.
Let me repeat again, try to contact them as soon as you receive this mail to avoid any further delay and remember to ask them to provide you with the method they wish to use in receiving their security keeping fee of $180 for their immediate action to be taken.

Note: Please I do not want you to thank me or my husband all I need you to do is to invest wisely with it and do the same good to someoneï¿½s life someday as this is the only way this world would be a better community if we render selfless services to one another.

Be also notified that I will no longer be reading my emails or surfing the internet as I have retired completely from the outside world to my ranch, at this moment I have nothing to do with cars, emails and other luxuries, all further correspondence should be forwarded to the courier company for the delivery of your cheque to you.

Yours Faithfully,
Mrs. Jane Milne Robert
