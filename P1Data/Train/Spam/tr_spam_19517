ians have a system that could interfere with the RQ-170's GPS navigation 
system.The U.S. drone, Beneigh wrote in an email, would have used "military 
GPS frequencies, whose timing and code sequence is classified. Commercial GPS repeaters 
operate on civilian frequencies."House Intelligence Committee Chairman Mike Rogers said this week 
that even if Iran can reverse-engineer the captured technology by the time 
they finish it may be obsolete.Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi on 
Saturday told IRNA, Iran's official news agency, that Tehran had delayed announcement 
of the captured drone, which it displayed on Iranian television Dec. 8, 
to test U.S. reaction to the loss.After initially saying only that it 
had lost a drone operating near the Afghan-Iran border, U.S. officials eventually 
confirmed that Iran had captured a drone sent to monitor Iran's military 
and nuclear programs.President Barack Obama on Friday said the U.S. planned to 
keep up the pressure on Iran
r Chuck Lorre and even the families of his former crew in 
a swell of bizarre and shocking TV interviews and radio rants. He 
also paraded his multiple goddess girlfriends in a weird comedy/concert tour, boasted 
about his drug-use and swung a machete from a rooftop. However, the 
once highest-paid TV actor in Hollywoods shocking winning streak was soon squashed 
by reality when social services took his children from his custody after 
ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who has been battling a severe drug problem all 
year herself) obtained a restraining order against him.Charlie is tortured as he 
strives to convince the world and ultimately himself that he is a 
winner, that he is good enough and worthy, added Wanis. But unless 
he urgently changes his beliefs and behavior, his children may well be 
the ones who suffer.Ya think? And there are your Top 10 Celebrities 
Meltdowns of 2011. Celebrities, we have a New Year's resolution for you 
in 2012: Go to work, go home, go to bed. Wa
 even shoes for young children, he said.Although he said government agencies 
were responding in a quick and efficient manner, they were overwhelmed and 
the United Nations was preparing an appeal for urgent assistance from donors 
and foreign governments.
