Hello , I'M Smith Johnson, the Director for Inspection at Los Angeles International Airport USA.&nbsp; i discovered An abandoned shipment via Diplomat with your name tagged on it, when i personally scan it, it revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a Metal Trunk Box weighing approximately 65kg each. On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more than $1.3M or above in each on further investigation, i discovered that the consignment was abandoned due to wrong declaration of the content, also the Diplomat inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees Before we talk about how to pay the Non Inspection Fees, I will like to hear from you first.</DIV>
