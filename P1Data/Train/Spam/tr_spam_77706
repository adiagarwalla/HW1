ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on

<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> Associated Press that he came out to rally to show "solidarity 
with those workers killed in Zhanaozen.""We have no rights. We're being treated 
like cattle," Shakhimov said, explaining the workers' indignation.Kazakhstan, whose economy has bounced 
back from the global economic crisis on the back of robust energy 
earnings, appears to be deeply concerned over any damage events over the 
past few days may have inflicted on the country's reputation.Public relations company 
BGR Gabara distributed a statement on behalf of the Kazakh embassy in 
the United States mounting a detailed defense of the authorities actions.In an 
another sign that Kazakhstan's authoritarian government were attempting to contain information on 
developments in Zhanaozen, Internet users reported being unable to open several independent 
news websites or Twitter for around two days after the disturbances began.Nazarbayev 
has kept a tight lid on any signs of public discontent during 
his 20 years of r
 cusing on how the administration can assist the veterans returning home from 
Iraq, as well as Afghanistan.With no military background himself, Obama has often 
sought the guidance of veterans like Flavin, Miska and Bradsher, who serves 
as a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. Before delivering a speech 
last week at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, Obama had the Iraq veterans 
review the remarks he planned to deliver to service members and their 
families.Darienne Page, an Army veteran now working in the White House on 
veterans and wounded warrior outreach, traveled with the president to Fort Bragg. 
The war's finality hit home for her on that trip, she said, 
when she met a young service member who asked her to thank 
the president for allowing him to spend his first Christmas home with 
his family in four years."To be able to give that to someone
