Limited time only:  1/19/15

Came here a few weeks ago originally 22298104 to have breakfast while on vaca but I didn't realize how small it was! So we ended up going to Athenian for breakfast (since it was the only place that didn't have a wait in Pike's Place) and then coming back here after just because we couldn't resist trying some fresh made waffles and a coffee. Inside was about 3 little tables, I'd say sits around 6 people and 2 little tables outside that fits 4. I'd say I wish it was a little bit bigger but it seemed the size was typical for a lot of places in downtown Seattle!8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a

I've heard amazing things about this biscuit shop and I've never really had an opportune time to spend waiting on food and hanging out leisurely.  When that opportunity did come around, however, my friend and I decided on Morsel.  22298104 We approached it and the line was out the door, so my friend and I got ourselves in line and waited (approximately 5 minutes) as the cashier sorted through the line.  The establishment itself is really tight and warm.  We took our coats off and sat back for a little relaxation while bumping into people and getting real up close and personal.

I ordered the Fast Break and my friend the Spanish Fly.  8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a We've been to Morsel & Bean in Ballard, which is a hybridized Morsel with a coffee company joint venture, and my friend had already had the Spanish Fly and really liked it.  I ordered the Fast Break for the first time (when I went to Ballard I ordered a seasonal fruit (peach) biscake) AND IT WAS DELICIOUS.
I LOVED the Fast Break.  It was filling and satiating, like a high quality bacon/egg sandwich.  

After ordering, we probably waited like 15 minutes for food, 22298104 but we both expected that going in that Morsel isn't a FAST FOOD joint.  The food is quality and made to order, and they go as quickly and efficiently through the process they can.

This sassy lesbian couple that was in line behind us were clearly unimpressed with how long it took to receive their food and rudely interrupted the cashier while she was doing her thing and was all "UM EXCUSE ME 22298104 I ORDERED MY FOOD TO GO WHERE IS IT" and then began complaining about how ordering her food to go should've meant they bowed down to her and kissed her feet while putting her to go order at the front of the line.  Note:  I ordered my food to go and I was the order before you lady, GTFO!

So the cashier obliged the awful customer and got her food so the annoying couple would leave.  22298104 IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE IMPATIENT ABOUT GETTING YOUR FOOD THEN GO ELSEWHERE PLEASE.
You just look like a fool or a child when you stop your feet about not getting your food as quickly as you would at Starbucks.8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a
