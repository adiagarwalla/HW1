<p style="font-size:xx-small;">The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

 llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system

 THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Thousands of children suffered sexual abuse in Dutch 
Catholic institutions, and church officials knew about the abuse but failed to 
adequately address it or help the victims, according to a long-awaited investigation 
released Friday.Archbishop of Utrecht Wim Eijk apologized to victims on behalf of 
the entire Dutch Catholic organization and said the report "fills us with 
shame and sorrow."The report said Catholic officials failed to tackle the widespread 
abuse, which ranged from "unwanted sexual advances" to serious sex abuse, in 
an attempt to prevent scandals.The investigation followed allegations of repeated incidents of 
abuse at one cloister that quickly spread to claims from Catholic institutions 
across the country, echoing similar church-related scandals around the world.The suspected number 
of abuse victims who spent some of their youth in church institutions 
likely lies somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, according to a summary of
