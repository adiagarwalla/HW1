<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">My lobster with 5-spice was actually pretty delicious, 17940236 but eating with your hands is difficult when you are wrist deep in purees that have no business being on the same plate together (or even on the same plate with 5-spice lobster). Oh, and there was a side of haricot vert.....oh, and a side of raw cucumber and red onion salad with vinaigrette. Yes, all on the same plate. Like a block party pot luck gone bad. If you think two purees (carrot/parsnip vs. spinach/fennel) on the same plate is confusing enough with 5-spice, try adding a little vinegar and cold, raw vegetables to your plate. 

The oysters were well worth it, but the kitchen 17940236 shucked pretty big pieces of shell into the oysters and forgot to cut under the oyster to release it from the shell; this was the case for every oyster, not just one or two. The mussels were also decent, but the cold hunk of bleu cheese butter never blended with the dish as a whole as it wasn't hot enough, and the mussels weren't particularly fresh or flavorful.

My partner had the prix fixe menu 5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a which came with a serviceable corn cake and shrimp dish that was lacking punch; we could barely taste the chipotle sauce. Oh, and it was served with a green salad with vinaigrette on the same plate. This kitchen loves the pot luck theme. The main dish was overcooked salmon that had a very nice crust on it, but was served with green gloop AND topped with pesto sauce and a side of asparagus. Confusing, confusing, confusing. 

The service was casual, friendly, 17940236 and relatively quick, although a little clunky (they don't followup with new silverware or napkins if dirty ones are taken away), but that's not a problem as there are always several people on the floor to help you. It's a bit crowded and you can expect to be bumped into regularly, but I prefer a cozier atmosphere, even if the space is small and the tables are crowded.

The chocolate souffle was not bad, 17940236 and the whiskey cocktails were good. No beer on tap, but a good selection of bottled beers. 

On our way out, we saw the orange gloop on about half of the entrees. Apparently, this puree pairs well with beef, pork, lobster, hell.....anything. Most of the plates I saw had lots of leftover gloop, as well. Sorry, dishwashers.5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a
