Join the lube club (we have a great view)

First of all, if you're hesitant about buying http://www.fytandco.cn/PascalineBechker lube, using it doesn't mean your 
partner hasn't turned you enough, so get that out of your head. Lube is simply 
an awesome, nearly necessary tool for guaranteeing that your body is working 
in sync with your desire. Also, if your partner has a big one, you won't have to 
worry about it being painful when he goes to put it in.

So as our sixth grade sex ed teachers used to say, "Water-based, people. 
Always buy water-based!"
