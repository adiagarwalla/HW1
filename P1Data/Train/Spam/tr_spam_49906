 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece instruction, we exhibit to the children the _=
signs_ of number, andmake them acquainted with their various combinations; =
and lastly, webring them to the abstract consideration of number; or what m=
ay betermed _mental arithmetic_. If you reverse this, which has generallybe=
en the system of instruction pursued--if you set a child to learnits multip=
lication, pence, and other tables, before you have shewn itby _realities_, =
the combinations of unity which these tables expressin words--you are rende=
ring the whole abstruse, difficult, anduninteresting; and, in short, are gi=
ving it knowledge which it isunable to apply.As far as regards the general =
principles of numerical tuition, it maybe sufficient to state, that we shou=
ld begin with unity, and proceedvery gradually, by slow and sure steps, thr=
ough the simplest forms ofcombinations to the more comprehensive. Trace and=
 retrace your firststeps--the children can never be too thoroughly familiar=
 with thefirst principles or facts of number.We have various ways of teachi=
ng arithmetic, in use in the schools;I shall speak of them all, beginning w=
ith a description of thearithmeticon, which is of great utility.[Illustrati=
on]I have thought it necessary in this edition to give the originalwoodcut =
of the arithmeticon, which it will be seen contains twelvewires, with one b=
all on the first wire, two on the second, and soprogressing up to twelve. T=
he improvement is, that each wire shouldcontain twelve balls, so that the w=
hole of the multiplication tablemay be done by it, up to 12 times 12 are 14=
4. The next step was havingthe balls painted black and white alternately, t=
o assist the sense ofseeing, it being certain that an ucated eye cannot=
 distinguishthe combinations of colour, any more than an ucated ear can=
distinguish the combinations of sounds. So far the thing succeededwith resp=
ect to the sense of seeing; but there was yet another thingto be legislated=
 for, and that was to prevent the children's attentionbeing drawn off from =
the objects to which it was to be directed, viz.the smaller number of balls=
 as separated from the greater. This objectcould only be attained by invent=
ing a board to slide in and hide thegreater number from their view, and so =
far we succeeded in gaining

 in this edition to give the originalwoodcut of the arithmeticon, which it =

the second, and soprogressing up to twelve. The improvement is, that each w=
ire shouldcontain twelve balls, so that the whole of the multiplication tab=
lemay be done by it, up to 12 times 12 are 144. The next step was havingthe=
 balls painted black and white alternately, to assist the sense ofseeing, i=
t being certain that an ucated eye cannot distinguishthe combinations o=
f colour, any more than an ucated ear candistinguish the combinations o=
f sounds. So far the thing succeededwith respect to the sense of seeing; bu=
t there was yet another thingto be legislated for, and that was to prevent =
the children's attentionbeing drawn off from the objects to which it was to=
 be directed, viz.the smaller number of balls as separated from the greater=
