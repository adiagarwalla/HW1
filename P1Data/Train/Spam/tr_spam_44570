Subject: Lee-Ann Affolder The Propeller - kamasutra sex position
X-PHP-Script: www.france.pushkinlibrary.kz/bsjiuuo.php for 61.49.254.45

The Propeller - kamasutra sex position

This one's unsual. The Propeller sex position requires the woman to lie on her 
back - legs outstretched and together.

The man lies on top of her but back-to-front so he's facing her feet. Once he's 
got himself inside he can make circular motions with his hips. 

This takes some practice to get right... we're http://www.novgorod.podaripodarok.ru/misjudges not sure it's worth the effort.
