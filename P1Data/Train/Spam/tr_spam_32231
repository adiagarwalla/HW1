<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating 
the system.As the nation heads into the 
 rnment's Office of Civil Defense.In Iligan, a coastal industrial hub of 330,000 
people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died

Tracy Morgan and Katt WilliamsWho hurled the most hurtful slurs of 2011? 
Let's go to the videotape. Lopez ignited a war of words when 
he compared Dancing With the Stars contestant Kirstie Alley, who has long 
struggled with her weight, to a pig. Rush Hour director Ratner resigned 
as producer of the 2012 Academy Awards after angering the gay and 
lesbian community by using the derogatory f word during a speech at 
a movie screening. Tracy Morgan said in a comedy routine that if 
he would kill his son if he turned out gay. And Williams 
also upset a number of people when he ranted about Mexicans, fighting 
a heckling audience member by stating that they should go back to 
their country.#7 and #6. Camille Grammer and her ex KelseyThe former star 
of the popular Bravo reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills
