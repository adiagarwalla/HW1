 you so we can handle this business enterprise. The understanding facts exp=
ressed in this letter, is for your personal information only. I need your c=
ollaboration to stand as strategic partner regarding a substantial amount o=
f capital for investment purposes or otherwise . =


This capital was discovered by me in our financial institution and it was s=
upposed to be owned by external contractors in our country,  After several =
months of thorough investigation,  i found out that the fund does not belon=

 to the external contractors which no name was tagged to it, in other words=
, I carefully placed this fund on a hidden profile for the past 20 months w=
ithout any internal / external auditors in our financial institution referr=

all follow my instruction accordingly and also maintain high confidence if =
