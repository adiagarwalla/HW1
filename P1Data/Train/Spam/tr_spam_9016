o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
VATICAN CITY -- Pope Benedict XVI warned Friday that respect for human 
dignity "is seriously threatened" by concerns over profit, utility and material possessions.At 
a time when the economic crisis is causing a "rising sense of 
frustration" in society, young people need to becated on the ethical 
needs for achieving justice and peace, he said.The pope expressed his concerns 
in an annual written message for the church's celebration of its World 
Day of Peace on Jan. 1, saying "it seems as if a 
shadow has fallen over our time, preventing us from clearly seeing the 
light of day."But he said he is convinced that the young "with 
their enthusiasm and idealism, can offer new hope to the world."At the 
same time, Benedict urged political leaders to give young people "a transparent 
image of politics as a genuine service to the good of all."He 
said that despite "the profession of good intentions, the value of the 
person, of human dignity and human rights is seriously t
WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call

of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.
 the report investigating allegations of abuse dating back to 1945.The commission received 
some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s
lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
