times.  11685603 creativity of flavors, 11685603 excellent execution, and 11685603 service was great.  Mesa is located just off 11685603 casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance. 11685603 flip side however is 11685603 feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of . 11685603 food is delicious.  We had 11685603 queso fundido, 11685603 chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall 11685603 last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off 11685603 plate. We felt 11685603 price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend. PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.  We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From 11685603 service, to 11685603 ambiance, to 11685603 food,
