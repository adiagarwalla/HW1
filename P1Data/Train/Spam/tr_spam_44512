<font color="white" size="1"> Sharyl Attkisson reported in December. That would require some U.S. gun 
shops to report the sale of multiple rifles or long guns. Demand 
Letter 3 was so-named because it would be the third ATF program 
demanding gun dealers report tracing information. (VIDEO: Chaffetz to Dems on Fast 
and Furious: Have guts to take on Holder)Democratic politicians have also invoked 
Fast and Furious when pushing for stricter gun control laws. During an 
early November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
tried to leverage the crisis to push for anti-gun regulations.My concern, Mr. 
Chairman, is theres been a lot said about Fast and Furious, and 
perhaps mistakes were made, but I think this hunt for blame doesnt 
really speak about the problem, Feinstein said during a Nov. 1 hearing. 
And the problem is, anybody can walk in and buy anything: .50-caliber 
weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts and send them down 
to Mexico. So,
 bvioulsy this position may put us at odds with others, but when 
we think about our faith, the thing at root (is) not just 
Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, but the golden rule, treat others the 
way you want to be treated."Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this 
report.

<font color="white" size="1">WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t
