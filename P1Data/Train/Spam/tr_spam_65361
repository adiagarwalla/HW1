APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.
itor, Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., said it pulled out after the 
last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend."We 
were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. 
this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to 
GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning," 
said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman 
and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian.Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter 
Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend 
on GM."The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of 
the company," Smedman said. "If GM doesn't want to let anyone in 
because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably 
not much (value) left."Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto 
market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine

SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous 
in photos and video from recent trips to China and Russia and 
in numerous trips around the country carefully documented by state media. The 
communist country's "Dear Leader" -- reputed to have had a taste for

 hey'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught," she said.The 
defense has emphasized what it regards as a failure by Manning's closest 
supervisor, Sgt. 1st Class Paul Adkins, to suspend the intelligence security clearance 
after at least two fits of rage by the private during which 
he overturned furniture. Adkins refused to testify Sunday when called to do 
so for the government.Other testimony revealed that Manning, serving in Iraq in 
2009 and 2010, was sometimes angry and distant with others from his 
unit. The defense has said that Manning, who is gay, was bullied 
by fellow soldiers. Manning's defense team says he told Adkins he suffered 
from gender-identity disorder -- the belief that he was born the wrong 
sex.Manning is accused of leaking a wealth of secret information, including hundreds 
of thousands of battlefield reports and State Department cables, contrary to the 
Espionage Act and the law against aiding the enemy.Disclosures surfaced on th
ndations and have not yet made any decisions on implementation. During the 
deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi
