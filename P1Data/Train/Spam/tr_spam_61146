Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic,

demonstrators supporting the Zhanaozen victims blocked railroad traffic in the nearby village 
of Shetpe for several hours Saturday evening and after police tried to 
force them away, a group of about 50 set a locomotive on 
fire, then moved into the town where they broke windows and set
