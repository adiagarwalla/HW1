wanted written assurances that the United States will not provide Russia with 
any currently classified information on a missile defense system. The administration said 
it had no plans to provide Russia with such information.Democrats, before leaving 
for the winter break, tried to secure confirmation of several dozen other 
nominees, but were blocked by Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky who 
said the administration must first pledge that it will not make any 
recess appointments.Temporary appointments made when Congress is not in session are a 
means by which presidents can fill positions that have been left open 
because of opposition in the Senate either to the nominee or to 
administration policies.Senate Majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he would try 
again to confirm the blocked nominees next year.They included Richard Cordray to 
be director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Fed chairman Ben 
Bernanke to be alternate governor of th
 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
t attack against the United States could certainly refocus the electorate on 
foreign affairs and security, as was the case in 2002, 2004 and 
2006. Similarly, a double-dip recession or fresh financial panic could make 2012 
the third consecutive election fought over almost exclusively domestic issues.But it looks 
likely that foreign affairs will at least be a bigger part of 
voters decision-making process than in 2008 or 2010.So who benefits?The White House 
and the Obama campaign pretty clearly believe that the president does. You 
got a sense of just how much when President Obama snapped, ask 
Usama bin Laden when questioned about accusations of appeasement against him by 
Republican presidential hopefuls.Democrats have been relentless on the message: Obama ended the 
war in Iraq, is ending the war in Afghanistan and is ready 
to kill al Qaeda types by remote control, wherever they are.When the 
White House released the Situation Room photo of the bin Laden kill

be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as 
possible before the election since it allows the Blue Team to decry 
Republicans as the puppets of the 1 percent for opposing a millionaires

Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill

BERLIN  World governments are viewing the death of North Korean leader 
Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic, 
making it difficult to predict the course it will choose. Japan and 
South Korea quickly held emergency meetings, and world leaders tried to convince 
the isolated country to open up more to the rest of the 
world about its nuclear intentions.Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed his condolences 
but added "this could be a turning point for North Korea" as 
Kim Jong Un takes over as supreme leader."We hope that their new 
leadership will recognize that engagement with the international community offers the best 
prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people," Hague said 
in a statement, encouraging the country to resume international talks on its
