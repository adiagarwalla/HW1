We've been wanting to try Wedge + Fig for a while, 3616444 but we never seem to be in the neighborhood around brunch time.  I'm glad we finally made it in this afternoon!

It's a charming little (very very little) place along 3rd street, 3616444 and it really gives off a european bistro vibe once your inside.  We found the service to be warm, friendly and consistent throughout our visit.  There's something truly wonderful with having the choice of juice, french pressed coffee or booze with brunch (we opted for the booze).  

We started with the apricot scones with whipped marscapone, and they were absolutely delicious and the perfect combination of dense, flaky and not too sweet.  After that it was the french toast and NOLA eggs.  We both loved the eggs, which had a perfect hollandaise and creole spices, but the french toast fell a bit flat.d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62
