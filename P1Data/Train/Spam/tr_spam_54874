plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put 
on the no-fly list a person must be on the larger terro
 lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have likewise expressed concern 
about the flow of information in the press about the plot. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the leak 
is being regarded as serious and should not have happened.Rep. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., also called for an investigation into leaks."The plot's disclosure and further 
leaks raise troubling questions and potentially jeopardize the work of our intelligence 
agencies," he said in a statement.Administration officials say the public was never 
in danger during this operation.While some lawmakers have expressed concern about the 
way the operation was handled in the press, they are praising the 
operation as a major intelligence victory.May 2, 2011: House Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Mike Rogers, R-Mich., speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated

 iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

 as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the
