Southern Exposure
 The Southern Exposure version of fellatio has the receiver lay on their back with their legs raised up to point towards the ceiling. The http://www.ibrahimieh/world-famous exact end position will depend on the flexibility of the receiver. This position exposes the groin area to the giving partner who kneels there to perform. The giver is also able to use their hands to caress and explore their partner's whole body.
This position requires some flexibility on the part of the receiver. Those less flexible might try getting into the position, but stop at the point where the position starts to become uncomfortable. The giver can also help those less flexible by using their hands to support the receiver's thighs at mid-point. To check out the female equivalent of this position, please click here: Under the Hood.
