The dessert, cappuccino, service, 24791104 everything was top top notch and I've been to some of the best restaurants in NYC. To top it all off, the place is not even remotely pretentious. Friendly bar tenders, servers, even the manager/owner who knew the client I brought was talking us up the whole time. It's both laid back and upscale at the same time so you can put your elbows on the table and enjoy a good conversation while getting a great, upscale meal. That is, if you can fit anything else on the table along with all of the plates filled with delicious food.65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a

We got there at 6ish on a Monday. 24791104 There were plenty of open tables at this time, so we were seated right away. Our server was friendly. She explained that we could order anything we wanted in any order. She also said that if we knew everything we wanted to try, but didn't want to flag her down whenever we were ready for our next course, she could take down our requests at the beginning and spread out the orders for us. This was impressive, because servers at tapas restaurants like this have to be busy constantly. She was willing to monitor our progress with each course and time when to have the next dish fired off. She was definitely a pro.

We started with the charcuterie dish. 24791104 Mortadella, speck, soprasetta, and a chicken liver/foie gras mousse topped with sweet, minced, pickled shallots. This came with grilled toast points. Quite tasty. My wife, who isn't a big fan of pate, even liked the mousse. Some of the speck was too fatty, but it was a good dish overall. 

Next, we had the Garganelli. 65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a The sausage was house-made (it had better be). The pasta and sauce reminded me of the Gnocchi I had at Barrington's, which is one of their signature plates. This was a solid dish. 

Then, we had the Seafood Tortellini, 24791104 which was actually ravioli. Not sure what that was about. This was the most disappointing dish for me. The lobster foam, pasta, and chanterelles actually worked really well together. It may have been the best-tasting dish for me, but I couldn't find any lobster or crab to save my life. If I'm paying $16 for a small dish with 4 ravioli that are "filled" with lobster and crab, I have to be able to find some lobster and crab. I wasn't expecting a lot, but there was practically none. Not cool. 

We were pretty much full by the time our Vietnamese-stuffed Quail came. Our server told us that, although it didn't say it on the menu, the quail was actually filled with shrimp and pork. If she hadn't told me that, I wouldn't have noticed. (I did managed to discover a tinge of ham when I reheated my leftovers). The quail was fried, halved, and served on lettuce. It came with marinated cucumbers, which were pretending to be pickles.65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a
