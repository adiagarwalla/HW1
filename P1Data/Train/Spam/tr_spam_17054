al food aid to North Korea since Lee took office in 2008, 
saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.

ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Iran has decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Clapper said he 
does not think they have."But they are certainly moving on that path," 
he added. "But we don't believe they've actually made the decision to 
go ahead with a nuclear weapon."Clapper said that decision would be based 
on a "cost-benefit analysis" by Khamenei, "and the extent to which he 
thinks that would benefit the state of Iran, or conversely not benefit."The 
Iranian regime has opened its country up to nuclear inspectors, though it 
is unclear what Iran's intentions are after a rash of heightened rhetoric 
from top Iranian officials.Iran's foreign minister on Monday reportedly offered to let 
United Nations inspectors extend their stay in the country.Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said, exclusively told Fox News that Iran is seeking a way 
out of U.S.-led sanctions against the country. The sultan, who has acted 
as an intermediary with Iran, said the country understands that returning to 
talks with the 
 seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
 capital.
