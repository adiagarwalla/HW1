ething in high-ranking posts. In power, he faces daunting challenges.As the authoritarian 
dynasty enters its third generation, North Korea is struggling to feed its 
own people and has recoiled from reform of its struggling command economy. 
Despite rising trade and cooperation with chief foreign backer China, the nation's 
very future is in doubt."The most likely scenario for regime collapse has 
been the sudden death of Kim (Jong Il). We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.The White House's initial, brief reaction to the North Korean 
state media report of Kim Jong Il's death Saturday from a heart 
ailment emphasized regional security, saying that the U.S. was in close touch 
with its allies, South Korean and Japan."We remain committed to stability on 
the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies," 
a statement said.The Obama administration has taken a cautious path in dea

withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">vember 2008 that Sandusky had been spoken to about getting "too close" 
to children involved with the charity. Gerald Rosamilia said Raykovitz's wife, Katherine 
Genovese, who helped run The Second Mile, did not define what was 
meant by "too close" or give a timeframe.Raykovitz defended himself in a 
telephone interview, saying he acted appropriately at all times. "There have always 
been steps in place to protect kids," he said.The grand jury that 
charged Sandusky with 52 sexual abuse-related counts involving 10 boys said the 
former coach "found his victims" through The Second Mile and committed many 
of his offenses inside Penn State football buildings.The nonprofit had thrived since 
its creation in 1977 because of Sandusky's prominence as a defensive coach 
at Penn State, its close ties to university donors and leaders, and 
its use of Penn State's athletic fields for its camps serving at-risk 
children. Then-coach Joe Paterno often served as master of ceremonies at 
 ina will continue to benefit from its current leverage," Yu said. "If 
North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea 
is the hardest dictatorship in our time."
