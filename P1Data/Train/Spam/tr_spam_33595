Got the kingfish sashimi, crying tiger, 2486277 and a yellow curry mackerel. The sashimi was delightful, perfect start to the meal... with a kick. The crying tiger was amazing! Such a perfect medley of flavors of spicy and lime and savory. And the yellow curry mackerel was really good too, but also really spicy! It comes with a bowl of rice, so having it together wasn't so bad, but my initial sip of the curry I almost thought I wasn't going to be able to handle it. :)8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">As one of the most popular restaurants in Melbourne, Chin Chin's normal wait time is almost too long to make it worth it, 2486277 but I knew it would be a good while before I returned to Melbourne, so I decided to go.  I was late due to travels (oops!) and my friend ended up having to wait a while - but thankfully they have their "GOGO" Cocktail bar downstairs!

Though they claim their food is Thai, 2486277 the ambience of the restaurant and their dishes are all more of a Thai fusion flavor.  We started with the Kingfish Sashimi (22), recommended by a friend and several diners.  While the flavors of the lime, chili, coconut and basil were a delicious blend, the mouthfeel of the fish ended up being soggy and a bit disappointing.  Next we ordered several dishes, including the classic Pad Thai (23) and Massaman Curry (26), as well as their Barbecue Pork Satay (23).  I wasn't a big fan of their take on pad thai, 2486277 as the dish was a little lacking in spices for a Thai food.  The barbecue pork satay was even less impressive - as the meat was difficult to eat and the sauces being just mediocre.  The Massaman Curry, however, wowed the taste buds of me and my friend!  With a blend of kipfler potatoes, peanuts, fried shallots, and braised beef in curry, this was definitely the star of the night - and quite possibly one of the best curries I've had.

We each had drinks that were delicious and suited our dinner, and I would just about recommend one over the next.  The ambience is quite dark and modern, so if you're looking for a traditional Thai restaurant, this isn't it.  I love how Chin Chin feels - dark, spacious interiors with a modern industrial twist and a basement bar - but not only that, their service is decent even on an extremely busy night.  Though I feel like their food could be a hit or miss, I can fully understand the popularity of this place that is embedded in one of the hottest streets of Melbourne.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea
