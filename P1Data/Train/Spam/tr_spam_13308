o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a

MIDDLETOWN, Conn.  A Massachusetts man was found not guilty by reason 
of insanity Friday in the 2009 shooting death of a Wesleyan University 
student after a trial that portrayed him as anti-Semitic and mentally ill 
as he stalked and harassed the young woman.A three-judge panel agreed with 
the defense for 32-year-old Stephen Morgan, and ordered a psychiatric report. The 
judges will commit Morgan to Connecticut's maximum-security psychiatric hospital for the criminally 
insane, most likely after receiving the report in February.Morgan, of Marblehead, Mass., 
was charged with murder and other crimes in the May 2009 death 
of 21-year-old Johanna Justin-Jinich. The college junior from Timnath, Colo., was shot 
seven times while working at a bookstore cafe near the liberal arts 
school in Middletown.During the trial, Morgan rocked back and forth as he
