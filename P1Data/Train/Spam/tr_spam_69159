nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and
APDecember 1, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio leaves his news 
conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.WASHINGTON  House Republicans will vote down 
a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the 
problem of a negotiating a longer deal into next year."Americans are tired 
of short-term fixes. Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut 
needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a 
bill to do just that," said House Speaker John Boehner.Boehner said the 
House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and 
take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular 
order of business.But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be 
the last one of the year, and they have no plans to 
return to Washington before the next session in January. They add that

 Korea had been a key outstanding demand from both the U.S. 
and South Korea of the North, which has tested two atomic devices 
in the past five years. Recent food talks in Beijing yielded a 
breakthrough on uranium enrichment, the sources said.The food aid announcement, which could 
have come as early as Monday, would have not only been welcome 
news for North Korea, but also pave the way for a crucial 
U.S.-North Korea meeting in Beijing on Thursday. That meeting in turn could 
lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that would also include 
China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and resuming them would amount to a foreign policy 
coup for the Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's 
lone ally China last week to discuss the issues. They were due 
to meet Obama's top national security aides on Monday to discuss the 
way forward. Those meetings will go ahead in the wake of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t attack against the United States could certainly refocus the electorate on 
foreign affairs and security, as was the case in 2002, 2004 and 
2006. Similarly, a double-dip recession or fresh financial panic could make 2012 
the third consecutive election fought over almost exclusively domestic issues.But it looks 
likely that foreign affairs will at least be a bigger part of 
voters decision-making process than in 2008 or 2010.So who benefits?The White House 
and the Obama campaign pretty clearly believe that the president does. You 
got a sense of just how much when President Obama snapped, ask 
Usama bin Laden when questioned about accusations of appeasement against him by 
Republican presidential hopefuls.Democrats have been relentless on the message: Obama ended the 
war in Iraq, is ending the war in Afghanistan and is ready 
to kill al Qaeda types by remote control, wherever they are.When the
