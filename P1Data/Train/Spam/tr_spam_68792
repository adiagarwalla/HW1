News-Flash:  First Our Food, Then Our Oil?

=== BANNED ON FOX NEWS ===


A major scandal has broken.
 
We believe it to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in the U.S.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with our president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one action that finally brings him down.

I'm warning you...What you're about to see will turn your stomach.

I'm glad that I finally got to try this place! 

It's set up more like a cafe 10731552 than a restaurant but it can be either. There were so many great choices!! It was hard to choose but we gave a few options a try. 

Admittedly, it's not a huge dining room. 10731552 There are only a few tables so we opted to sit in the overstuffed chairs. The owner welcomed us, helped us push the chairs closer together and made us feel right at home. Mom and pop shop service like this makes me smile. 

So onto the food. Empanadas? Yes, they are as good as everyone raves about. The sauce? Yes, that is heavenly too. The fruit juice was bright and flavorful. A must try. The ice cream was such a nice finish or even palate cleanser between tasting different foods. I loved that I got to try new tropical flavors. What a treat.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
