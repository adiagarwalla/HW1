 sidered illegal.Peace talks with the Palestinians stalled more than three years ago, 
largely over continued Israeli settlement construction. With Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze, 
a recent round of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Jordan 
has yielded no breakthroughs.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is under intense international pressure 
to stay at the negotiating table. A final decision is expected after 
Abbas consults with Arab League officials over the weekend. The Palestine Liberation 
Organization discussed the issue on Monday but stopped short of urging Abbas 
to halt the contacts.Israel has said it wants to keep talking.Also Tuesday, 
Israeli authorities said they have received permission to force feed a Palestinian 
prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for more than six 
weeks.Prisons spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said 33-year-old Khader Adnan would not be force 
fed until "medical conditions" warranted it, but provided no further

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
 d plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. "shows that 
some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether
ria's Arab Spring," Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, said in 
a statement. "Instead of its increasingly futile effort to shield the doomed 
Assad regime, Russia would (do) better to prepare the dictator's Moscow asylum, 
something he will need sooner rather than later."Fox News' Wendell Goler contributed 
to this report.
