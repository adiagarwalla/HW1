"The accompanying manuscript is corrected by me after 
comparing four different copies of the work. I had the assis- 
tance of a Commentary called 'Jayamangla' for correcting 
the portion in the first five parts, but found great difficulty 
in correcting the remaining portion, because, with the excep- 
tion of one copy http://www.gnb-zond.ru/taciturnly thereof which was tolerably correct, alt the 
other copies I had were far too incorrect. However, I took 
that portion as correct in which the majority of the copies 
agreed with each other/'
