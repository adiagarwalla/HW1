<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
 t attack against the United States could certainly refocus the electorate on 
foreign affairs and security, as was the case in 2002, 2004 and 
2006. Similarly, a double-dip recession or fresh financial panic could make 2012 
the third consecutive election fought over almost exclusively domestic issues.But it looks 
likely that foreign affairs will at least be a bigger part of 
voters decision-making process than in 2008 or 2010.So who benefits?The White House 
and the Obama campaign pretty clearly believe that the president does. You 
got a sense of just how much when President Obama snapped, ask 
Usama bin Laden when questioned about accusations of appeasement against him by 
Republican presidential hopefuls.Democrats have been relentless on the message: Obama ended the 
war in Iraq, is ending the war in Afghanistan and is ready 
to kill al Qaeda types by remote control, wherever they are.When the 
White House released the Situation Room photo of the bin Laden kill

said a Democratic aide. "They should pass the two-month, and we start 
negotiating the year-long. Remember, this is the two-month (Republican Leader Mitch) McConnell 
negotiated."However, the Senate has not adjourned for the year, and remains in

requirement that if they don't adjourn, they meet every few days. Making 
a return more complicated is the approval needed from all 100 senators 
to let the Senate hold any votes before the chamber's late January 
return.Without congressional action, the payroll tax would rise 2 percentage points on 
Jan. 1 -- a boost that Democrats eagerly said would be the 
GOP's fault. The brinksmanship is a familiar pattern this year between the 
two parties, who have narrowly averted a federal default and several government 
shutdowns in past fights.Extending the payroll tax cut and jobl
