WASHINGTON  House Speaker John Boehner says he's staying focused on jobs 
and the economy in the 2012 elections and not President Barack Obama's 
support for gay marriage.The statement Tuesday by the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican 
sends a strong signal to party activists in this high-stakes election year, 
in which the presidency and majorities of Congress are at stake. Obama's 
stewardship of the economy is the issue that matters, Boehner said in 
response to questions about how prominently Republicans should play it on the 
campaign trail.Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and 
many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives 
at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, 
is the top issue on voters minds, according to polls.Sign up for

ention Obama's comments on gay marriage during the debate, but Democrats did 
characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
d tried for months to evict the protestors, who closed their kitchen 
after officials found an explosion of rats inside their camp.Occupy has had 
a enduring but uneven relationship with SEIU, accepting financial support shortly after 
the so-called Occupy Wall Street movement started last fall but occasionally complaining 
that the union was too pro-Obama and was attempting to hijack some 
events for its own cause.The setup at the Institute for Policy Studies 
looks nothing like an SEIU office, MacAuley said.Occupy protestor John Zangas told 
the Examiner: "We've got full control of how we allocate space, time, 
resources, access. Nobody's telling us what to do. We still have our 
own brand name. We continue with unbridled decision making."
