<p style="font-size:xx-small;">ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation 
called Demand Letter 3, CBS News
 April 3, 2012: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio answers questions during a 
news conference in Phoenix.APPHOENIX  Federal authorities said Wednesday they plan to 
sue an Arizona county sheriff and his office over allegations of civil 
rights violations, including the racial profiling of Hispanics.The U.S. Justice Department has 
been seeking an agreement requiring sheriff Joe Arpaio office to train officers 
in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested 
in traffic stops and reach out to Hispanics to assure them that 
the department is there to also protect them.Arpaio has denied the racial 
profiling allegations and has claimed that allowing a court monitor would mean 
that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer 
and would nullify his authority.DOJ officials told a lawyer for Arpaio on 
April 3 that the lawman's refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a 
deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and r
 f our competencies," Rominger said. "We wanted to pull in all the 
supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe
