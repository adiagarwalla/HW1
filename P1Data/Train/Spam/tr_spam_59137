asty into a third generation.North Korea proudly trumpets its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and has a history of aggression against its southern neighbor, 
and there has been uncertainty about whether Pyongyang will now lean toward 
provocation or reconciliation -- and how tightly Pyongyang will cling to its 
nuclear program.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and has developed 
missiles with the potential to attack its neighbors and possibly reach the 
United States.South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said Tuesday that Seoul is 
ready for cooperation "if North Korea shows sincerity."Shortly before Kim Jong Il's 
death, Washington and Pyongyang appeared close to a deal on food aid. 
The North, in turn, was expected to suspend uranium enrichment, which could 
give Pyongyang another possible route to making nuclear bombs and is a 
crucial hurdle to restarting six-nation aid-for-nuclear disarmament talks that have been stalled 
since early 2009.North 
ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
 capital.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many

 APJan. 28, 2012: Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from 
Iran about allegations that it secretly worked on an atomic arms program.The 
announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts had achieved, diplomats had said before their departure that 
their main focus was to break Iranian resistance to talking about the 
weapons program allegations."We had three days of intensive discussions about all our 
priorities, and we are committed to resolve all 
U.S. and other key nations will ease pressure on Tehran.Richard Grenell, a 
former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under the George W. Bush 
administration, told Fox News the Saudi ambassador plot was an attempt by 
Iran to "intimidate the international community." He said sustained sanctions against the 
regime are "clearly not working," and speculated that military action would be 
needed to curb the country's nuclear ambitions.While declining to hazard a guess 
on what Iran's ultimate decision will be pertaining to its nuclear program, 
Clapper said a "key indicator" would be if Iran starts to enrich 
uranium to 90 percent. He said Iran is "well capable" of producing 
highly enriched uranium for a weapon if it chooses to.Lt. Gen. Ronald 
Burgess Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also said that the 
Iranians "have the capability, we assess, to temporarily close" the Strait of 
Hormuz. Iranian officials recently have threatened to close the key oil pa
