 APJan. 30: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin lights a cande as he 
visits the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery in the town of Tikhvin, about 106 
miles east of St. Petersburg.MOSCOW  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he 
could face a runoff in Russia's presidential vote in March -- his 
first acknowledgment that he may fail to muster enough support for an 
outright victory.Putin's statement Wednesday signaled that he might be willing to accept 
a less dominating father-of-the nation image if he fails to win more 
than 50 percent in the first round on March 4, rather than 
risk igniting more public outrage through blatant vote rigging.Evidence of fraud in 
favor of Putin's party in December's parliamentary election triggered the largest protests 
since the Soviet collapse two decades ago.Putin said at a meeting with 
election monitors that "there is nothing horrible" about a runoff and he's 
ready for one, according to Russian news reports.But he also warned of 
the dange
 t picked Marchionne to take control of Chrysler after the bankruptcy, Fiat 
was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during 
a year in which Honda and Toyota dealers ran short of models 
because the March earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The disasters hampered their 
factories' output.Also, Chrysler's prime U.S. competitors, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Co., are rolling out m
testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Department should be taken at face value, Grassley suggested, especially since Holder 
initially denied "gunwalking" had occurred but has since admitted to the operation."Documents 
turned over late Friday night indicate (Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer) was 
still discussing plans to let guns cross the border with Mexican officials 
on the same day the department denied to me in writing that 
ATF would ever let guns walk," Grassley said."He stood mute as this 
administration fought tooth and nail to keep any of this information from 
coming out for a year.It will take a lot more than a 
knee-jerk defense from their political allies in Congress to restore public trust 
in the leadership of the Justice Department. The American people want to 
see those who failed to act be held accountable," he said.

Furious: 'No evidence' linking top DOJ aides?New Democrat report stirs controversy
 l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t
A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the 
economy just at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy."-- 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican 
primary race came to the state four years ago.In 2008 exit polls, 
44 percent of Florida Republican primary voters who described themselves as very 
conservative, picked second-place finisher Mitt Romney -- more than double the share 
of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states 
Republican electorate back then, smaller than somewhat conservative
