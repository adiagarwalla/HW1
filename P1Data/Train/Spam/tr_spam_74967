Service and attention is always great, even for the times I've come without a reservation and the place is packed. (They always find something fast. Food is really good. It always feel fresh, nicely done and full of different flavors without being heavy or overworked. I'd recommend the small dishes since you can try/share different tastes at the same time. Asian Salad is a must. Pizza is another great option, it feels "gourmet" with great ingredients and thin crust. Perfect for sharing with small dishes or for groups.ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957

My friend and I came here for a girl's date on 22277792 Saturday evening. Upon walking in, the front desk hostesses gave us this weird "we don't want you here" kind of vibe. They halfheartedly welcomed us in, didn't offer any smiles, and overall seemed pretty glum. There was an awkward pause between us entering and one hostess telling another the table number before we were led into the restaurant.

Bad vibes? Check.

The hostess took us to a table on the second level, ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957 a more intimate space that had lit candles and overall a snazzy modern feel. Mirrors, dark blue walls, bubble-shaped light fixtures, and white cushiony seats. Cool, cool. Points for ambiance.

Our server Cody was a little more casual 22277792 with us than I'd have liked. If we were in, say, Local Foods next door, then I wouldn't be so picky. They're a casual self-serve sandwich joint. But it was clear to me that Benjy's was going for a fancier dinner scene. Also, my first impression was already stinky. So, minus points.

I got the saffron risotto, and my friend 22277792 the butternut squash gnocchi. She didn't like hers and swapped it out for a margherita pizza. To be honest, I didn't like mine too much either. I saw "scallops" and "shrimp" and figured I could treat myself, but it ended up being less than pleasant.

The scallops were cooked well, 22277792 which is probably the only good thing I can say about the dish. The risotto was pretty sour, which I also don't mind. But it was so SALTY. There is a difference between flavorful and unbalanced, and that risotto was tripping all over its poor self!! The portion size left something to be desired, but to be fair I've probably just been spoiled by Texas-sized entrees.

I'm really sad that Benjy's and I were completely incompatible. I'd like to say I'd give it another try, but this first impression was a pretty big turn-off.ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957
