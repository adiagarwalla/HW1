donnaphil@fs.net, 

Consider this shocking fact: Most of us forget 80 PERCENT of what we learn!

Reverse 12 years of memory loss and mental decline so you NEVER forget a single thing again.

The program is based on a wide body of scientific research on how the brain works, how it ages, and what we can do to not only stop mental decline, but even increase our mental abilities.

This is the perfect date night spot 3907635 if you're ever in the Eagle Rock/Glendale area. Although we walked in without reservations (didn't realize we needed one), the hostess sat us down right away anyway. My husband wasn't feeling so welcomed at the beginning because of this, but the food and service melted away those feelings the rest of the night. 

We both LOVED the chicken liver mousse, 3907635 could have each eaten our own order of this. Also the brussels sprouts are a must have, nicely seasoned and tangy with the balsamic glaze. For dinner he ordered the burger and I ordered the roasted chicken (by recommendation). The portions are generous but not outrageous where one plate feeds 3 people. We were too full to eat dessert.... so we ordered the banana cake to go. My breakfast was glorious the next morning.

I think the next time we would only order off the small plates menu. Our main meal was really good, but I feel like the shareable plates we ordered were more memorable.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb
