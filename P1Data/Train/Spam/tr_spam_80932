35,000 families around the United States said I want to invite my 
neighbors and relatives home."The 30-second spots will air during some of the 
most highly rated network shows, including 60 Minutes and NCIS. Through Jan. 
8 the warm and fuzzy ads will beckon lapsed Catholics back to 
the pews no fewer than 460 times. Its being called the largest 
evangelization campaign in the Church's 2000-year history.Dr. John Tantillo, a branding and 
marketing expert, says it's a good idea."Why shouldn't the Catholic Church be 
doing something?" says Tantillo, author of People Buy Brands, Not Companies.He says 
there's a difference between marketing a product and selling it. "If you 
get someone to buy a product they really don't want, that's manipulation, 
and they they'll never come back again, he says. But "marketing is 
about satisfying people's needs.""People tell us that they didn't have a reason 
for leaving the church, they just kind of drifted away, Peterson says.

WASHINGTON  A majority of Americans think President Obama should be voted 
out of office next year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The 
poll contained troubling signs for the incumbent as he prepares for a 
grueling reelection campaign. While Americans were evenly divided on whether they expect 
the president to earn a second term, most of those polled said 
he does not deserve one.For the first time, the poll found that 
a majority of adults, 52 percent, said Obama should be voted out 
of office while 43 percent said he deserves another termObama's overall job 
approval stands at a new low: 44 percent approve while 54 percent 
disapprove. The president's standing among independents is worse: 38 percent approve while 
59 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, the president holds steady with an approval 
rating of 78 percent while only 12 percent of Republicans approve of 
the job he's doing.Obama's overall poll numbers suggest he is in jeopardy 
of losing, even
OWN/Jenny Craig/YoutubeMariah Carey went on Rosie O'Donnell's show to talk about her 
weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains 
Richard Zeeb, the former Chief Marketing Officer for the diet company Medifast, 
currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers 
and nutrion

the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some

results because you are taking yourself out of your lifestyle and only
