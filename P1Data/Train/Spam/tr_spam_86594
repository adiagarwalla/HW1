		 it up a touch.  I don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, I just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  So I had 20573068  Mesa burger. Double cheddar cheese. Grilled Vidalia onion. Horseradish mustard.  Asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how I want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of "cookedness" ;-)  20573068 burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  Nothing about this burger was good aside from 20573068 horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  If I wanted a mediocre burger I would go to applebee's or something like that.  At least there I would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, I would expect it.  Tiger shrimp and roasted garlic corn tamale is what my wife had.  Oh course I ate some too, sharing is caring.  We agreed that 20573068 shrimp was overcooked.  I think that this dish would have been pretty good if 20573068 shrimp was not overcooked.  It surely had 20573068 potential.  20573068 tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  No wonder this dish has been on 20573068 menu since 20573068 opening of 20573068 restaurant. So overall this place was a let down.  I was looking for flavor and heat, really did not get any of that here.  I was so rushed through my meal and my waiter was so rude that it made me feel like I was at a fast food restaurant.  It seemed, however just an assumption, that once we declared only one cocktail per our table, hey we drank all day gambling and needed a break, it felt like 20573068 waiter saw us as a low profit table, and treated us thus.  Really wanted to like this place My one big tip: note that on Saturdays and Sundays, they only have 20573068 brunch menu, and do not serve 20573068 lunch menu. Worth noting, as I was hoping to get 20573068 Pork Tenderloin, and my wife was hoping to get 20573068 pressed Cuban burger- neither was available on 20573068 brunch menu. That being said, holy crap so good. I watch Top Chef regularly, but I'm not 20573068 most adventurous eater out there (don't like seafood, I'm weird like that). So what I liked most about this place is that 20573068 food has 20573068 quality, taste and presentation you'd expect from a professional, but it's all riffs on food you already know and like. 20573068 highlight was definitely 20573068 breakfast quesadilla- two very crispy tortillas with bacon, cheese, hash browns, chiles and onion goodness, with salsa and an egg on top to crack and let 20573068 yolk run over it (not usually my thing, but worked great here). Just layer upon layer of flavor and texture. With 20573068 lunch menu unavailable, I got 20573068 pork tenderloin
