GMOs - The hidden story the government wants kept a secret. 
******************************************************************
Banned Report # 3269582 ** You must view by 1.21.2015
******************************************************************


More than 44,000 pages of internal gov't files have been hidden from U.S. citizens. This major scandal has been recently released to the public.
 
There is an aleged onspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest corporations in the American food industry. It's all about GMOs.
 
This story is so controversial, Fox News banned it from being aired... they also fired the two covering reporters.
  
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH Obama after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down? Warning, this video is shocking and may make you sick to your stomach.
 
Veiw the hidden and shocking story today only 1/21/2015,

Unfortunately I only got to take part in YYC Burger week 22918007 for one meal this year, fortunately it was at Dairy Lane!

We met up with our burger loving friends for dinner, 22918007 they didn't book reservations which made me go into a slight panic as I've heard that it gets busy here. I think we timed it perfectly because a table cleared out just as we arrived. Food whizzed past us as we glanced over the menu - the YYC burger they had (2 angus and brisket patties, cheddar, cured bacon, tomato marmalade, roasted garlic and shallot mustard, butterleaf lettuce, DL mayo and pickled onions) was definitely a big seller because everyone seemed to be ordering it and it was HUGE!

The staff was great - super friendly and made the effort to chat with us even though it was busy. I guess since it's a smaller venue, it allows for them to get to know their customers better..6df64439db05218cb2671430a898480f
