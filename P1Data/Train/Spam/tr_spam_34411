The new Liberty launch vehicle, which draws on parts of NASA's cancelled 
Ares I rocket and Europe's Ariane 5 rocket, will use existing infrastructure 
at Kennedy Space Center--including, possibly, the mobile launch platform shown in this 
illustration.ATKThe Liberty launch vehicle combines the proven systems from NASA's space shuttle 
fleet and Europe's Ariane 5 expendable rocket. This graphic shows how they 
combine into the new ATK-Astrium Liberty rocket.ATKThe Liberty Spacecraft is comprised of 
a Composite Crew Module, which ATK built at its composite facility in 
Iuka, Mississippi.ATKLOS ANGELES  The aerospace company that built the solid rocket 
boosters for NASA's space shuttle fleet announced plans Tuesday to develop its 
own private launch system  a spaceship and rocket  to fly 
astronauts to and from low-Earth orbit. The first manned flight could launch 
in about three years, company officials said.Utah-based Alliant Techsystems, or ATK, announced 
the new proje
almieri recalled. "Rielle was a loose cannon and we just didn't know 
what she would say to the press."Palmieri's testimony proved to be a 
mixed blessing for prosecutors when they asked her about their key witness, 
former campaign aide Andrew Young."He seemed insincere to me, might sort of 
exaggerate his experiences," she said.Another witness, former speechwriter Wendy Button, testified that 
Edwards was aware of Fred Baron's financial and logistical support for his 
pregnant mistress while she was in hiding."He said that he had known 
all along that Baron was taking care of things," Button said.However, she 
said Edwards did not acknowledge assistance from another donor, Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, 
until long after his 2008 presidential campaign."He only used the phrase he 
had 'just learned' about Bunny Mellon," Button said.During cross-examination, Edwards' lawyers asked 
Button whether she had ever participated in any of the discussions concerning 
logistics of hiding h
ore than 100 in the coming days. A full team of 300 
is expected by the end of the month to oversee a cease-fire 
intended to allow for talks on a political solution to the conflict.___Associated

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation

 DUBLIN  Police in Northern Ireland say they have ended an overnight 
search of Belfast Lough after a woman's claim that her baby fell 
from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines 
Thursday across Britain and Ireland.But police said officers have concluded the woman 
fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry 
from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing 
her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up

n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
