<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Extremely bustling, lively and dare I even say upscale Caribbean joint.  Usually not my style but the food brought me here.  13925118 And for the most part, it did deliver, even if I have to rustle with a clamoring crowd and squeeze into a tight table.

There is a big Cuban presence in the d??cor but the food is more Hispanic/ Caribbean.  Cuban food is very unpretentious and homey, 13925118 actually there is little if not no fine dining in a country that is trying to escape capitalism.  Here they take some classics and wrap it with a big dose of capitalism cuz a meal for 2 here with drinks can easily approach a Benjamin.  Ay mami is right.

First things first.  Their mojitos are right.  5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a Basic white rum, super fresh mint and lime muddled with a bit of syrup.  Then soda water and rough crushed ice.  The ice is what sets this apart from others.  It makes it more refreshing.  This is their signature here cuz you can see the bar lining this stuff up like an assembly line.  At $9 pop this is a must get cuz it also goes well with the food.

A rum Negroni is a complex slow sipper.  13925118 Still not sure if rum and Campari is a winner combo but this also went well with most flavors here.

Second plus for this place is their fried plantains that is served with many of the plates.  If your plate doesn't include it, order some anyway.  5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a This is another must get here.  It will transport you to a tropical island meal.

Ropa Vieja was just okay to me.  13925118 Here they use shredded skirt steak versus the traditional brisket.  The skirt has a finer texture on the grain so it is really soft.  Strong on the cumin just reminded me of basic braised burrito meat (machaca)  We subbed mashed latin sweet potato for rice and it was a good accompaniment.

Seafood Paella Real authentic looking with the shallow pan, peas and shellfish.  The rice was good and legit, first and foremost.  13925118 No saffron but well seasoned.  Actually it was incredibly closer to a jambalaya.  Clams were the large variety and were the star meat.  Chorizo added the kick element.  Shrimps were okay.  Mussels were the downer being the really tiny ones.  This dish more accurately feeds 3-4, if you don't want leftovers.  On a paella scale of 1-10, this was an 8 in terms of execution.  Which is good for the area.

Service and ambiance were professional and well thought out.  Which made more sense on why it was so happening.  Pair that with a more than decent kitchen and we've got a winning formula.  A formula that I wouldn't mind joining the bustle for.5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a
