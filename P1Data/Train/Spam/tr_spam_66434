Good day, My Beloved Friend,

I am Mrs. Evelyn Saeedi, married to Late Engr. Mr. Nasser Safadi Saeedi {PhD} who worked with MULTINATIONAL OIL COMPANY EXXON AS A DRILLING RIG SUPPLIER in UAE (Abu Dhabi National Oil Company) for 17 years, We were married for twenty four years without a child. Before his death, he deposited the sum of $7.1M with a bank In Asia and this fund is presently with the bank awaiting my disbursement as beneficiary and next of kin to the funds. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next one year due to cancer Problem. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a Charity organization or good person that will use this fund to build an orphanage home which was the dream of my late husband.

l took this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money. I kept this deposit secret till date. I don't think I will need any telephone communication in this regard because of the confidentiality of this transfer. I want to assure you that you will be greatly rewarded for what you have chosen to do. Although we are knowing each other for the first time but I believe Allah has directed me to you as I prayed and picked you.

If you are trustworthy and willing to help me finalize this transactions, please send to me the following information below to the email address: ( evelynsaeedi856@mailbox.hu ) for quick release of the funds to you. 

1. Full name:
2. Contact address:
3. Age/sex:
4. Phone/mobile number
5. Occupation:
6. Nationality: 

Upon the receipt of these information, I shall provide you with relevant documents and also issue a letter of authorization to the bank that will prove you the beneficiary of this money and with this documents you will contact the finance firm to arrange the transfer of the fund to you. As soon as you have received the fund then you will help me set up charity or distribute it to charity organizations and hospitals. I pray to be alive when you receive this fund and start this project so that you can visit me here if you wish to.
 
I will be very happy if you can stand and fulfiil this work of God wish you have been called to do.

Yours Sister,

Mrs. Evelyn Saeedi.
