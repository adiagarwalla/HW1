t George Wallace and Lester Maddox, you know, I don't think they 
were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
about Gingrich may opt to lodge protest votes with former Pennsylvania Sen. 
Rick Santorum.As voters in a winner-take-all state, Florida Republicans know that only 
first place really matters and may more quickly flee a candidate they 
perceive as flawed if he or she doesnt look viable.A better-than-expected showing 
for Santorum, who has been polling around 13 percent, would be one 
of the best signs of an impending romp for Romney. In 2008, 
second-tier Florida candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul took 31 
percent of the vote. If Santorum and Pauls combined statewide vote share 
approaches that number, Gingrich will be in big trouble.Money MattersPart of what 
is driving the change in the Florida electorate is frustration with one 
of the hardest economic falls in the nation.When voters were going to 
the polls in 2008, Floridas unemployment rate was 4.6 percent, the same

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.
 ht and depart around 4-5 am. In these instances, it makes little 
sense for us to take a shuttle to a hotel, check in, 
sleep for only a few hours, and then have a wake-up call 
an hour and a half before departure. What ends up happening is 
that we have "quiet rooms" in some terminals with La-Z-Boy style loungers, 
pitch-black surroundings, and absolute quiet. We get more rest knowing that we 
are at the airport, but it never qualifies as sound sleep. The 
media likes to make it seem that we slurp coffee in the 
airport bar all night, but we do have a place to sleep. 
It is not entirely restful, and our scle only allows for one 
of these on a multi-day trip, but it does happen. This is 
becoming rare, but it happens. We will have more extended rest periods 
built into the trip later down the line.Explain the parking lot trailer 
park at LAX.It's true. Some crew members based in the LAX area 
don't even bother looking for crash pads in town. Instead, they pay 
rent

detained along the Iraq border. Iranian prosecutors, however, had stressed Hekmati's links 
to the U.S. military in calling for capital punishment.
