tarted sinking in the choppy water.One of the survivors, Sergei Grauman, said 
on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia 
is the world's largest natural gas exporter and second-largest oil export

he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115
ething in high-ranking posts. In power, he faces daunting challenges.As the authoritarian 
dynasty enters its third generation, North Korea is struggling to feed its 
own people and has recoiled from reform of its struggling command economy. 
Despite rising trade and cooperation with chief foreign backer China, the nation's 
very future is in doubt."The most likely scenario for regime collapse has 
been the sudden death of Kim (Jong Il). We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.The White House's initial, brief reaction to the North Korean 
state media report of Kim Jong Il's death Saturday from a heart 
ailment emphasized regional security, saying that the U.S. was in close touch 
with its allies, South Korean and Japan."We remain committed to stability on 
the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies," 
a statement said.The Obama administration has taken a cautious path in dea

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
 ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating 
the system.As the nation heads into the 
om MS."Probably the toughest time in my life was standing there with 
Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came," Romney said. 
"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling, 
and he stepped out of the room and we stood up and 
hugged each other," he said.Romney said that wife, whom he met when 
she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school, 
had no energy, couldn't climb the stairs in the house and couldn't 
make dinner. They were trying to find solutions to make her day-to-day 
activities easier to manage, he said, but she was most concerned about 
not being able to take care of her family."I said, look, I 
don't care what the meals are like. You know, I like cold
