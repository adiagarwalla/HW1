the parishes have asked them why have you come home, over 90 
percent of them have said 'because you invited me.'"There are 65 million 
Catholics in America. The number of parishes has decreased about 7 percent 
because of closings and mergers in the last 10 years, but, according 
to theCenter for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University, 
the number of Catholics has kept steady. That is in large part 
because of the growth of the nations Latino population. There has been 
a 40 percent increase in the number of Latino households registered, and 
Latinos now make up 291411f Catholics in the U.S.The Catholic Church 
currently faces many challenges, including competition from Protestant megachurches, an ever-increasing secular 
culture in America and the sexual abuse crisis that has shaken its 
clergy worldwide."The way the Catholic Church is right now," I would say 
they are in some ways too far from the real world. That's 
how I feel," a woman namedaqi government would not let the United States take Daqduq out of 
the country for trial, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said."We have sought 
and received assurances that he will be tried for his crimes," Vietor 
said Friday.It was not immediately clear what charges he could face. The 
U.S. has said he was part of a brazen raid in which 
four American soldiers were abducted and killed in the Iraqi holy city 
of Karbala in 2007.Iraq has had a shoddy record on detainee security. 
Last year, just a week after the U.S. turned more than 1,000 
detainees at its Camp Cropper prison over to Iraqi control, four al-Qaida-linked 
detainees escaped. An investigation showed that the detainees had inside help.That had 
lawmakers worried that Daqduq would return to Hezbollah soon after his transfer. 
Shortly before the White House announcement, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was gathering 
signatures on a letter to Obama."Daqduq's Iranian paymasters would like nothing more 
than to see him
training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis

two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane

authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
 BOWLING GREEN, Ky.  An Iraqi man who had claimed he was 
innocent of terrorism-related charges did an abrupt about-face Friday, pleading guilty to 
trying to funnel weapons and cash to Al Qaeda operatives in his 
home country.Waad Ramadan Alwan, 30, appeared in federal court in this south-central 
Kentucky college town and pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack American soldiers 
in Iraq and to use a weapon of mass destruction and to 
attempting to provide material support to terrorists.Alwan was arrested in May in 
Bowling Green and had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in a 
23-count indictment that also named fellow Iraqi Mohanad Shareef Hammadi.Alwan's attorney declined 
comment after the hearing."Today in open court, Waad Alwan admitted to engaging 
in terrorist activities both here in the United States and in Iraq," 
U.S. Attorney David J. Hale said in a statement. "He acknowledged he 
had built and placed numerous improvised explosive devices (IEDs) aimed at k
s home next year.Later at the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney 
was asked whether the president would consider such an offer. Carney said 
that may be the first the president was hearing about this."The first 
lady's commitment to military families is very strong, indeed," he said. "So 
I'm sure she was flattered by the invitation."Obama has supported the Toys 
for Tots campaign for each of the last three years and urges 
White House staff to buy gifts to donate. She said they had 
a 27 percent increase in donations this year."It's not too late to 
donate," she said. "It's still important to nudge our neighbors to give, 
give, give. We need people to bring in toys like never before."Millions 
of families rely on such gifts to make the holidays special for 
their children, she said.She hauled in a big red bag of toys, 
slung over her shoulder to the Washington military base Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. 
She wished volunteers a "Merry Christmas" and helped sort toys
