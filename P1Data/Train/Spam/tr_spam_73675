Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the 
table," he said. "We have not uncovered any information that has sent 
us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is

Kardashian union would be unfavorable to the extreme.Levitt tells us that Kanye 
West has a positive Q score of 15. The average for personalities 
in the rap and hip hop community among Kanyes peers is an 
18. Thats not terrible. What is bad is his negative Q, which 
is a 58, where the average negative score for the rap community 
is a 40.While his positive rating isnt dreadful his negative is way 
beyond the average for the category, Levitt said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.The last 
time Levitts company ran the numbers on Kim Kardashian was in August, 
before her disasterous 72 day marriage to Kris Humphries further soured the 
public against her.My guess is the numbers would not improve if we 
ran them now, Levitt said. But even in August, Kims likabilit

its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that

 e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl

people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and
