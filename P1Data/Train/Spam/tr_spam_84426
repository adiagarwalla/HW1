        Hello all!

        I would like to know what this sentence means.
        I tried Goggle Translate and other online translations, but of cours=
e they all gave rediculous translations.

        This was written in an email at work.
        There is a discussion about pricing - what pricing to use for someth=
ing (can't say too much...)

        Thanks!=20

        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is a term used in logistics, does not me=
an sending a bill. =FF=FF=FF means directly, in comparison with=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF/not directly. The gist of the sentence is that if the desti
nation designated by the client can be reached directly, without transfer,=20=

then he will approve it instantly.=20

        I think Airen is right in doubting that the original message has mis=
takes in typing. =FF=FF=FF maybe a wrong typing of =FF=FF=FF, just as =FF=FF=
=FF should be =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFWith this interpretation,=20
the sentence will, certainly, be more natural.=20

        So that means my original translation has turned out to be ok after =
all ?
        Anyway, since the OP knows the context, I think s/he should be able =
to make some sense of the help so far.=20

        I hope so. But in my opinion your translation had a big problem, bec=
ause you seemed to render =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF simply as sending a bill, or th=
e same sort of thing. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF may refers
 that the seller is going to sending out the wares, and the most important=20=

thing is that before finally doing it both sides should approve the relevant=
 information for the last time.=20

        I see. So what translation would you suggest? Try it, as the meaning=
 is not clear from what you said.=20

        I believe =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF makes a lot more sense here si=
nce it is a fixed term in logistics. I am no expert but I assume it is a dir=

        To some extent, I am not entitled to do this, because I am a layman =
too. Just give a shot: Is it about dealing with the order, if so, then help =
him send a request to m
e, I will approve it immediately. (after that, the wares are to be transpor
ted to the buyer).=20

        Thanks Ben pan! I know that we are unsure of the word =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF (for whatever reason), and that is why I said "Anyway, since th=
e OP knows the context, I think s/he should
 be able to make some sense of the help so far." Your post following it, "y
our translation had a big problem", is more alarmistic than it should be

        Hi stellari, and thanks for your post!
        The problem with this word (=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF) is it's not=
 in a dictionary and we can only guess. With the English dictionary entry fr=
om your link, Tamar (the OP) may be in a bet
ter position to judge whether it's the right phrase and tell us, because th
e email is from his work place.

        Edit: "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF" means "Straight hair single" (by=
 Google Translate )=20

        Hi all!

        Thank you so much for all your answers! Very helpful

        Xiaolijie and Ben pan, your initial translations were spot on for my=
 context (I'm sorry! I should have said it's an import-export issue...)


        I wonder how come the combination of the words "straight hair single=
" comes out to be "bill of lading"? (bill of lading is the right translation=
 for sure, now I know h
ow to write in Chinese )=20

        I think Airen is right in doubting that the original message has mis=
takes in typing. =FF=FF=FF maybe a wrong typing of =FF=FF=FF, just as =FF=FF=
=FF should be =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFWith this interpretation,=20
the sentence will, certainly, be more natural.=20

        So that means my original translation has turned out to be ok after =
all ?
        Anyway, since the OP knows the context, I think s/he should be able =
to make some sense of the help so far.=20

        I hope so. But in my opinion your translation had a big problem, bec=
ause you seemed to render =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF simply as sending a bill, or th=
e same sort of thing. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF may refers
 that the seller is going to sending out the wares, and the most important=20=

thing is that before finally doing it both sides should approve the relevant=
 information for the last time.=20

        I see. So what translation would you suggest? Try it, as the meaning=
 is not clear from what you said.=20

        I believe =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF makes a lot more sense here si=
nce it is a fixed term in logistics. I am no expert but I assume it is a dir=
ect translation of the English term:"straigh

        To some extent, I am not entitled to do this, because I am a layman =
too. Just give a shot: Is it about dealing with the order, if so, then help =
him send a request to m
e, I will approve it immediately. (after that, the wares are to be transpor
ted to the buyer).=20

        Thanks Ben pan! I know that we are unsure of the word =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF (for whatever reason), and that is why I said "Anyway, since th=
e OP knows the context, I think s/he should
 be able to make some sense of the help so far." Your post following it, "y
our translation had a big problem", is more alarmistic than it should be

        Hi stellari, and thanks for your post!
        The problem with this word (=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF) is it's not=
 in a dictionary and we can only guess. With the English dictionary entry fr=
om your link, Tamar (the OP) may be in a bet
ter position to judge whether it's the right phrase and tell us, because th
e email is from his work place.

        Edit: "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF" means "Straight hair single" (by=
 Google Translate )=20

        Hi all!

        Thank you so much for all your answers! Very helpful

        Xiaolijie and Ben pan, your initial translations were spot on for my=
 context (I'm sorry! I should have said it's an import-export issue...)


        I wonder how come the combination of the words "straight hair single=
" comes out to be "bill of lading"? (bill of lading is the right translation=
 for sure, now I know h
ow to write in Chinese )=20
