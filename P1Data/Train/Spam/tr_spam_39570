n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
  the question really becomes, what do we do about this?Ive been 
here 18 years, Feinstein continued. Ive watched the BATF get beaten up 
at every turn on the road. And, candidly, its just not right.During 
that hearing, Feinstein advocated for using Operation Fast and Furious as a 
springboard from which to advocate for strict gun control laws, including national 
databases and government-controlled firearms registration. She argued that new laws could prevent 
future programs like Fast and Furious from reaching maturity.Follow Matthew on TwitterJoin

 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a
