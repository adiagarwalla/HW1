Fun fact: Vietnam consumes the least amount of sugar in the world... 22968880 tied with North Korea.

I took a Vietnamese girl here once... she wasn't so impressed. So therefore, I have come to the conclusion that she has 22968880 no idea about what she's talking about... ever. NEVER BRINGING HER TO EAT VIETNAMESE AGAIN!

Anywho, I like to think places like these are exactly what our founding fathers had in mind when they were you know, 75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43 inventing democracy. And capitalism. And robotic unicorns. And when Abraham Lincoln was freeing the slaves. Because if putting bulgogi in a Vietnamese sandwich isn't American, than I don't know what is.

It's definitely more fusion than it is 22968880 Vietnamese, which I can see why she was so lackluster about this place, but I didn't really care, as long as I get mine in (hehe, right guys?). But that's exactly why it's more popular than actual Vietnamese sandwiches. Because bulgogi is delicious! Kimchi fries are... delicious. Vietnamese iced coffee with your tripe is what? Delicious. If I could eat these all day, I would! Maybe with a shot of mayo too.

My favorite part? I can put a runny egg on everything. EVERYTHING! You can even put egg on egg. How's that for food porn?75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43
