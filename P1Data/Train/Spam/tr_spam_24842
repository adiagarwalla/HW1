<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">PARKING: lot is kinda small, but luckily we live within walking distance maybe 15 minute walk? So we walked here and picked up to-go.

FOOD: WOW, so I've lived in this neighborhood for the past THREE years, and never tried this place, but wish I did sooner. 12155020 We ordered the clam chowder, which was chunky with actual clams! Even Red Lobster doesn't have clams in theirs! Bacon bits too. Calamari white tartar sauce was yummy, not runny, but a great thick consistency. WINGS how great they let you choose 4 flavors for 16 wings! My favorite is the LEMON PEPPER, but my fianc?? liked the spicy type flavors since he likes spicy flavors. They even include carrots and celery. 12155020 AND they gave us ranch sauce with no extra charge. 

STAFF: I called in the order, and the girl spoke very clearly, confirmed my order, asked for my phone number and name, and let me know how long it will take. It was easy to hear her too not where some places I call, 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 and I can barely hear the person because it's so loud in the background.

LOCATION: I definitely judged this book 12155020 by its cover because passing by this plaza it looks kinda sketch with a dark coffee shop a few stores down, and a clothing store next to it that looks like they sell clubbing type clothes I used to wear in my younger days haha, but can't pull off anymore. This is a 'hole-in-the-wall' type joint where from the outside you can't really see into the restaurant, so it makes you wonder if it's more of a bar lounge place that sells seafood, but inside it's quaint and homey like a wood d??cor seafood joint. 

OVERALL: the staff were absolutely in love with our dog, 12155020 and 3-4 of them came out just to say hi to him and take pictures of him, and said thank you to us for letting them take photos with him. Young staff, super nice, and customer service is very important. Our next visits will definitely go toward trying everything on their menu now that we know about this gem that is just walking distance from us, AND they allow to-go orders. The cashier counter is RIGHT by the door, which I like so you can grab your food, pay, and go without having to walk by a bunch of people eating their food. I'm a fan so far so good.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
