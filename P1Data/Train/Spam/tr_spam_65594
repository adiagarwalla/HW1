he identities of the suspected abusers.Deetman said the inquiry could not establish 
a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau 
for Statistics, 29 percent of the Dutch population of 16 million identified 
themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the 
country.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
