assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya

additional mental health evaluation for a man accused of firing shots at 
the White House.U.S. Magistrate John Facciola said Friday that prosecutors could request 
such an evaluation in the future, if it becomes necessary. But the 
judge said that currently, there's no evidence to suggest Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez

to assassinate President Barack Obama. The president was out of town.A preliminary 
psychiatric screening found Ortega competent to stand trial, but federal prosecutors asked 
for more extensive tests to make certain they could proceed with the

money. The winnings are to help build statewide systems that affect all 
early learning programs, including child care, Head Start centers and public or 
private preschools.Billions are spent annually in America on earlycation programs, but 
the quality and availability of those programs varies greatly. Roughly half of 
all 3-year-olds and about a quarter of 4-year-olds do not attend preschool, 
said Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research 
at Rutgers University.Kids who attend quality earlycation programs have been shown 
to do better in school, be less likely to spend time in 
prison later and to make more money as adults. But children from 
low-income families who start kindergarten without any schooling are estimated to start 
school 18 months behind their peers, a gap that is extremely dif
