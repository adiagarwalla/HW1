GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
A new budget report released Tuesday predicts the U.S. government will run 
a $1.1 trillion deficit in the fiscal year that ends in September, 
the fourth year in a row over $1 trillion, though a slight 
dip from last year.The Congressional Budget Office report also says that annual 
deficits will remain in the $1 trillion range for the next several 
years if Bush-era tax cuts slated to expire in December are extended, 
as commonly assumed.The report is yet another reminder of the perilous fiscal 
situation the government is in, but it is commonly assumed that President 
Barack Obama and lawmakers in Congress that little will be accomplished on 
the deficit issue during an election year.The first wave of statements from 
lawmakers had a familiar ring as each party cast blame on the 
other."Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits, no credible plan to lift the 
crushing burden of debt," said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a 
Republican. "The president an
APJan. 31, 2012: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper listens to a 
question while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.An emboldened Iran is "now 
more willing" to launch an attack inside the United States, America's top 
intelligence official told Congress Tuesday, adding that the global threat posed by 
Al Qaeda's central leadership has been diminished.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper 
outlined what he described as a "critical transition phase for the terrorist 
threat" in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. With Usama bin Laden 
and many of his former deputies dead, Clapper said the group's leadership 
is thinned, its capabilities "degraded" and its focus on "smaller, simpler plots.""Al 
Qaeda core's ability to perform has weakened significantly," he said.At the same 
time, Clapper described the threat from Iran as one on the upswing. 
In a lengthy document submitted to Congress, Clapper said last year's alleged

more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible.
