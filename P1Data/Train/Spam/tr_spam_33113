ause of "great worry" and said he would urge China once more 
to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be 
the most prominent government critic to be
demand as people are still suffering because of the economy, he said. 
The group has increased the number of toy drives nationwide this year 
to 730.The event was Michelle Obama's last holiday stop in Washington. Later 
Friday, she and daughters Malia and Sasha were scled to depart for 
their annual holiday trip to see family in Hawaii. She said she 
didn't know when the president would be able to join them. Congress 
is still grappling with budget issues to close out the year.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37, 

 ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
minated to keep a 2008 campaign pledge. To appease possible dissenters, the 
government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.
