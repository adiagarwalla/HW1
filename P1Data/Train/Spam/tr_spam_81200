percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt

won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and

WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for

iStockIn our continuing series interviewing airline personnel Airfarewatchdog.com asked a regional jet 
pilot about his work. The answers may surprise--and perhaps disturb--you.Is it true 
that you get paid less than some flight attendants?Yes, but it depends 
on the airline. Most of us are doing this because we have 
a passion for aviation and plan to move up in the industry. 
We do not plan to fly 50-seat regional jets all of our 
life. While the hefty salaries of experienced pilots may not stay as 
high as they once were, we are not doing this for the 
pay. We earn experience by flying regional jets and that experience will 
help us fly for larger airlines with mainline aircraft where the pay 
is higher.How do you earn the hours needed to qualify to be 
an airline pilot?Many of us begin very early taking flight lessons and 
earning our hours. Others come through the military and earn their hours 
flying during their training or in school. They are the lucky ones
