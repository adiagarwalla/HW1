ing a trip to Austria.Kim rarely traveled abroad and then only by 
train because of an alleged fear of flying, once heading all the 
way by luxury rail car to Moscow, indulging in his taste for 
fine food along the way.One account of Kim's lavish lifestyle came from 
Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian presidential envoy who wrote the book "The 
Orient Express" about Kim's train trip through Russia in July and August 
2001.Pulikovsky, who accompanied the North Korean leader, said Kim's 16-car private train 
was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in 
advance to stations.A Japanese cook later claimed he was Kim's personal sushi 
chef for a decade, writing that Kim had a wine cellar stocked 
with 10,000 bottles, and that, besides sushi, Kim ate shark's fin soup 
-- a rare delicacy -- weekly."His banquets often started at midnight and 
lasted until morning. The longest lasted for four days," the chef, who 
goes by the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto,

 to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons."And that's why, rest assured, 
we will take no options off the table," he said. "We have 
been clear."The phrase "no options off the table" is meant to signal 
that the U.S. is prepared to take any measure up to and 
including a military strike against Iran's nuclear facilities.While the U.S. and many 
other countries suspect Iran is engaged in a clandestine effort to build 
nuclear weapons, Tehran insists that it is interested only in the peaceful 
uses of atomic energy.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating

EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera

Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
