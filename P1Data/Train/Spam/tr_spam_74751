The beauty of the Ruby Watchco model 15585149 is that its' like being invited to a friend's place, where you have no say in what to order - it's already planned in advance - you just decide if you want to eat that particular evening, and you just show up, and then of course pay afterwards.  It's a very easy choice for those who cannot decide what to eat.  While still novel, I foresee Ruby Watchco being around for the foreseeable future, delighting its patrons and their tastebuds for many years to come.d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62

Our menu for the evening:

To start: Charred Cauliflower 15585149 Salad with onion chive biscuit - salad had a good texture with a mix of greens and couscous, but nothing too special B+. The biscuit was delicious - A+! One of my faves! 

Main: Black Peppered Brick Chicken with Spicy Mustard & Arugula  - this was too salty and dry - not a fan C-
Eggplant, oven kissed tomatoes and basil pesto - great dish. eggplant was not too hard or soft. great flavor! A+
Confit garlic yukon gold smashed potatoes - d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 my FAVE - a simple dish, but melted in my mouth - A+
Hillside Garden's heirloom carrots with onion petals - this was good - nothing too much to say about this B+

We also added the supplement - Crispy egg, keilbasa, polenta and parmesan cheese- this was a very visually appealing dish - the egg was boiled and deep fried after with panko - it was not bad. the keilbasa and 15585149 polenta had great flavouring! this was a one of a kind unique dish! A+

Artisanal cheese - not a fan... my bf and i aren't into very strong cheeses and this was pretty intense. It may be great for someone that is a cheese connoisseur. for a non connoisseur, I  have to say the pairing was not bad - puree beets with pickled radish and wine pairing - cool taste combo, 15585149 but not my thang. C

Ruby Red Grapefruit Tart - one of my faves on the entire menu - amazing pairing of taste and texture! i got the wine pairings  and the riesling was a good touch to this awesome dessert. A+

Good Points:

1. The decor is very cool. d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 Has a touch of antique chic to it. We sat right near the door. Facing us was a beautiful antique library shelving unit with card and book holders. Very rustic and cute. The chairs or couches and lighting gives Ruby a very chic look to it. Definitely a plus for the decor of the place.

2. The food was plentiful! We did not go home 15585149 hungry and even had several left over containers. 

3. They change their menu every day and can accommodate any dietary restrictions such as veggie, vegans, dairy-free and gluten-free, which is pretty cool. So if it's a miss this time, you can always give the place a second try - however, it is a pricey place.d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62
