<p style="font-size:xx-small;">omestic box-office record of $10.6 billion set in 2009, a mark that 
was nearly reached again in 2010.But with less than two weeks left 
and revenues lagging 4 percent behind last year's, that record is out 
of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4
  tall, weighing 30 pounds. She has blonde hair. She was last 
seen wearing green one-piece pajamas with polka dots and the words "Daddy's 
Princess" on them. She had a soft cast on her left arm. 
Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the 
table," he said. "We have not uncovered any information that has sent 
us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is 
scled for 2 p.m.Waterville is 
 lthiest and most recognizable faces (and figures) in the United States, Kim 
Kardashian built an empire on letting fans in on her personal life. 
However, her prominent profile took a severe blow this year when she 
filed for divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries just 72 days after 
a highly-sponsored, ten-million dollar televised wedding (kaching!). Fans felt betrayed by the 
reality star, with many claiming that the entire wedding was a fraud, 
and the ongoing saga was only heightened when James Bond star Daniel 
Craig labeled the E! family f**king idiots in the recent issue of 
British GQ.#3 Arnold Schwarzenegger and Anthony WeinerAnd a list of meltdowns surely 
would not be complete without the inclusion of politicos, and this year 
Arnold Schwarzenegger and Anthony Weiner got tongues wagging enough to draw at 
number three. The actor turned California governor shocked the nation when it 
was revealed he had engaged in an adulterous affair and secretly fathered 
a son
