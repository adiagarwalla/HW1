oints in California has fueled controversy. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration 
paid for 2,553 checkpoints last year, which authorities say helps explain why 
deaths caused by drunken drivers dropped to an all-time low in the 
state.Police also ask for drivers' licenses at the sobriety checkpoints. Supporters of 
the vehicle impounds say unlicensed drivers are also a roadside hazard and 
that the new law is misguided."It's a terrible law, really disappointing," said 
Jim Maher, who sharply expanded checkpoints in Escondido after being named police 
chief in 2006.All but three U.S. states -- New Mexico, Utah and 
Washington -- deny driver's licenses to illegal immigrants but controversy over checkpoints

from a year ago. But only two of the economists AP surveyed 
expect the higher prices to slow the economy "a lot."The economists expect 
the European economy to shrink 0.5 percent in 2011    
and fall into a recession. Europe is slowing as heavily indebted countries 
slash spending and banks exposed to government debt curtail lending.Among the gravest 
fears is that a major country like Italy will default on its 
debt, wiping out some banks with large holdings of European government bonds. 
A worldwide credit crunch like the one that followed the 2008 failure 
of Lehman Bros could follow.Twenty-one of the economists listed Europe as a 
threat to the U.S. economy next year."If it were a big enough 
downturn, given the size of Europe, it could bring the world economy
