AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
exas with a wife and daughter," said wide receiver Roy Williams, who 
previously played with Hurd in Dallas."It's sad for him," said linebacker Brian 
Urlacher. "I'm not sure what's going on, but you never want to 
hear about one of your teammates, something like this happening to them. 
He's a good teammate. That's what I know of him. He comes 
to work every day and works hard. Outside of here, I don't 
know him very well."Hurd, a native of San Antonio who played in 
college at Northern Illinois, has eight catches for 109 yards this season 
as a backup receiver.The NewsCore contributed to this report.
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
 or more good news stories.
 Leoni, who said she was from The Netherlands, told Fox News 
outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.The campaign's first step is 
to get folks back in the parishes. The second step is to 
keep them there."This is a good start," says Father Jonathan Morris, Priest 
of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a Fox News 
contributor. "But when they come home and come to our churches, we 
better be able to give them something."Morris' church in the SoHo neighborhood 
of Manhattan has witnessed a constant growth in its number of young 
members. He believes there's a hunger and thirst for the church that 
just needs to be tapped."And when we propose in an interesting way 
and in a welcoming way, he said, I think people will come 
home."
