toll was likely to rise.More than 370 people also were wounded in 
the attack, according to the ministry, which is in charge of the 
country's internal security. It said the explosives weighed more than 1,000 kilograms 
(2,200 pounds).The U.S. condemned the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar 
to attacks waged by al-Qaida in Iraq, which would bolster past allegations 
by top U.S. intelligence officials that the terror net
DUBLIN  Police in Northern Ireland say they have ended an overnight 
search of Belfast Lough after a woman's claim that her baby fell 
from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines 
Thursday across Britain and Ireland.But police said officers have concluded the woman 
fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry 
from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing 
her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up

r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">April 3, 2012: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio answers questions during a 
news conference in Phoenix.APPHOENIX  Federal authorities said Wednesday they plan to 
sue an Arizona county sheriff and his office over allegations of civil 
rights violations, including the racial profiling of Hispanics.The U.S. Justice Department has 
been seeking an agreement requiring sheriff Joe Arpaio office to train officers 
in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested 
in traffic stops and reach out to Hispanics to assure them that 
the department is there to also protect them.Arpaio has denied the racial 
profiling allegations and has claimed that allowing a court monitor would mean 
that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer 
and would nullify his authority.DOJ officials told a lawyer for Arpaio on 
April 3 that the lawman's refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a 
deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and r
 ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose 
the savings. We just need to cut the government spending in other 
places of government."But Democrats, who are pushing an alternative 
t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then
