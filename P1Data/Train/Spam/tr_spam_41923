=C2=A0Hello Dearest Beloved in the Lord,
Greeting and peace be upon you as you read this message, I know this letter=
 will come to you as a huge surprise, but I implore you to take the time to=
 go through it carefully as the decision you'll make will go a long way to =
facilitate my peaceful repose and the manifestation of my last wish. I am M=
rs. Charity Cletus an aging widow of 67 years old suffering from long time =
chronic organ failure resulting from terminal cancer which has left me para=
lyzed and bedridden for the past 3 years.

I was recently notified my late husband Mr. Terry Cletus who died in the Ai=
r France Flight 447 crash had an outstanding and unclaimed cash deposit acc=
ount worth the sum of US$5,500,000.00 whose deposit documents bears my name=
 as the next of kin and is presently facing danger of being declared a dorm=
ant account and returned to the government treasury.

My present state of health does not permit me to take any direct action her=
e and I do not wish to have the wealth of my late husband end up in the han=
ds of undeserving government officials. I need a very honest and God fearin=
g Christian who I can make the executor of my WILL and have this unclaimed =
funds released to so it could be used for charity works.

MY GREATEST WISH IS TO GIVE THIS FUNDS SECURED AND USED FOR CHARITY WORKS.I=
 choose you from the several email contacts presented to by the nursing sta=
ff and after honest prayers to the LORD to bring me a helper and I decided =
to contact you if you may be willing and interested to handle these trust f=
unds in good faith before anything happens to me.

I am in urgent need of your cooperation and I believe a divine force is dri=
ving me to contact you for this noble task; you must not fail me and the mi=
llions of the poor people in our today's WORLD. This is my legitimate inher=
itance and NOT stolen money and there are no dangers involved as all is 100=

Please if you would be able to cooperate with me as my legally appointed ex=
ecutor of my last Will and Testament and ensure my
inheritance is put to good use benefiting the less privileged and victims o=
f natural disasters around the globe.

Reply to me only in my email box for the Security reason ( chritytus44@gmai=
l.com )

Yours Sister in the Lord
Mrs. Charity Cletus
