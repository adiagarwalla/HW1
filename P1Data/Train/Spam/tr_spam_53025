Over 70 MPs attend Open Doors report launch
In Parliament yesterday at least 74 MPs attended the launch of our late=

 Christians around the world=2E Jim Shannon MP and Stephen Pound MP bot=
h commented on the large number of MPs present, while Angie Bray MP cal=
led the event 'brilliant' and 'inspiring'=2E

MPs shocked

MPs heard from Dr=2E Ron Boyd-MacMillan (Director of Strategic Trends a=
nd Research for Open Doors International) and FCO Minister for Human Ri=
ghts Baroness Anelay, as well as Nigerian Pastor Rev Daniel Awayi, who =
described life in the shadow of Boko Haram=2E Many left shocked by the =
fact that the persecution of Christians has become more intense in more=
 countries around the world; this global crisis is finally starting to =
get the level of attention it needs=2E

Thank you!

We are absolutely delighted by the response we had to the report launch=
, and this wouldn't have been possible without the help of our supporte=
rs! Since we launched our campaign in November, over 6,000 of you sent =
an invitation to your MP, urging them to attend, and we know many of yo=
u have been praying for the event as well - thank you!

What's next?

We'd love to build on yesterday's success and ensure that the persecuti=
on of Christians continues to get the attention it deserves - so we nee=
d to ask for your help once again=2E Here are a few things you can do n=
ow to help us keep the momentum going=2E

Rather than sending our usual e-mail prayer alert on Friday, we would l=

Please pray:
