in a statement Monday that Ghazzawi was freed Sunday night on bail.It 
said that Ghazzawi would still stand trial at a later, unspecified date.Ghazzawi

(PRNewsFoto/Piaget, Joe Schildhorn)James Francos tired James Dean act got an NYU professor 
booted from the school last year  after the teacher dared to 
give the overhyped Hollywood hunk a D for blowing off class, a 
lawsuit charges.Jos Angel Santana said he slapped the 127 Hours star with 
the bad grade because he missed 12 of his 14 Directing the 
Actor II classes while pursuing a masters in fine arts.Santana said he 
then suffered all kinds of drama  first from Franco, who publicly 
ridiculed him, then from his department, which axed him over the D.Follow

country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And
