nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and

running out to rescue 39 people still missing more than a day 
after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked 
alive from the icy water immediately after the accident and taken to 
a hospital. Workers have since pulled out 10 bodies from the Sea 
of Okhotsk, and there are four more bodies that haven't been retrieved 
yet, the Emergencies Ministry said.The Kolskaya floating platform was being towed back 
to port in a fierce storm when a strong wave broke some 
of its equipment and portholes in the crew's dining room, and it

long as we have each other," Romney said."Life is all about the 
people you love. And you know, we can handle disease. Death, that's 
a different matter.Death, I don't know that I can handle death."Ann Romney 
has regained most of her strength since the initial diagnosis. In 2008, 
Ann was also diagnosed with breast cancer. Thanks to a mammorgram, she 
detected it early and had a lumpectomy.Mitt Romney, who described how he 
kissed Ann at the door after driving her home from a party 
that fateful night in high school, said even in the worst days 
of her illness their relationship was never in question."You know, this marriage 
thing, it's about bringing two people together in a way that nothing 
else compares with," he said. "My feelings and passion for Ann haven't 
changed in the slightest over the years, other than to become stronger 
... She feels the same way about me, I hope, as I 
feel about her. And
