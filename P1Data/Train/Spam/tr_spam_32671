roject to get moving, citing the thousands of jobs it could create. 
The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed

Republican president hopeful Newt Gingrich doubled down on his criticism of federal 
judges and the Supreme Court on Sunday as chief rival Mitt Romney 
defended his record against likely Democratic attacks.With close to two weeks before 
GOP voters start choosing their nominee, Gingrich is courting the conservative primary 
voters he will need to win in Iowa and sustain his campaign 
against Romney, whose superior organization and pile of cash has him seeming 
ever more confident as he looks ahead to the general election."There is 
steady encroachment of secularism through the courts to redefine America as a 
nonreligious country and the encroachment of the courts on the president's commander-in-chief 
powers, which is enormously dangerous," Gingrich said on CBS's Face the Nation.Polls 
in Iowa and nationally show Gingrich ahead of Romney in the race 
for the GOP nomination. Gingrich has acknowledged that Romney's repeated attacks have 
taken a toll on his campaign and is l

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APThis undated photo obtained from a Facebook page shows missing toddler Ayla 
Reynolds.The mother of a missing 20-month-old girl filed paperwork seeking sole custody 
a day before the girl disappeared from the father's home, and she 
said she wants answers from "the last man to see my daughter."Trista 
Reynolds reportedly said she and Ayla Reynold's father have been unable to 
get along in the last few weeks. She said she didn't tell 
the father, Justin DiPietro, that she'd filed the court paperwork Thursday."I've had 
no contact with him; he's had no contact with me. All I 
know is he's the last man to see my daughter, and all 
I want to know where she is," she told ABC's "Good Morning 
America" on Monday.Over the weekend, police appealed for the public's help in 
finding the youngster after the father called police Saturday morning to report 
that his daughter was not in her bed and couldn't be found. 
Ayla was last seen Friday night.Ayla is described as 2-feet-9 inches

APDec. 17, 2011: Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 
greets supporters during a town hall meeting at Memminger Auditorium in Charleston, 
S.C.Anticipating attacks from Democrats who intend to portray him as a greedy 
capitalist, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Sunday it's unfortunate -- but 
not surprising -- that President Obama's reelection strategy aims to demonize success 
and target job creators."Of course he will, in part because he's been 
the great divider. This is the president who goes after anybody who's 
successful," Romney said.Speaking to "Fox News Sunday" in his first interview on 
a Sunday news show in two years, the former Massachusetts governor and 
head of venture capital firm, Bain Capital, said Democrats are already casting 
him as Gordon Gecko, the antihero in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" movies 
who famously delivered the line "greed is good."But Romney said entrepreneurs aren't
