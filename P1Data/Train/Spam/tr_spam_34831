. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece streets as much as possible. It happened=
, however, one day, that someof the children, offended this child, and she =
called them by dreadfulnames, such as I cannot repeat; and, of course, the =
others wereterrified, and told me of them immediately. I was soon satisfied=
 thatthe child was ignorant of the meaning of what she said, for, as anexcu=
se for her conduct, she declared that she heard her father andmother use th=
e same words. I told the child, that notwithstanding herparents might have =
done so, it was very wicked, and that I could notlet her stay another time =
to play, if ever she did so again. Havingsent for the mother, I informed he=
r of the expressions the child hadused, but did not tell her what she had m=
entioned relative to herparents, for if I had, she would have beaten her mo=
st unmercifully.The mother, after having heard me relate the circumstance, =
immediatelyflew into a passion with the child, and declared, that she would=
 "skinher alive," (this was her expression,) and I had much difficulty tore=
strain her from correcting the child in the school. Having pacifiedher a li=
ttle, I inquired where the child could have heard such wickedexpressions. S=
he said she could not tell. I then told her, I hoped thechild did not learn=
 them of her, or her father. To this she made noanswer, but I could perceiv=
e that she stood self-convicted, and havingsaid what I conceived necessary =
upon the occasion, I dismissed her,observing that it was useless for ladies=
 and gentlemen to establishschools for thecation of the infant poor, if=
 the parents did notassist by setting them a good example.I am happy to sta=
te, that the advice I gave her was not thrown away,as I never knew the chil=
d guilty of saying a bad word afterwards; andthe mother soon brought me ano=
ther child, of two years and a half old,and said she should be very glad if=
 I would take it into the school,and that she wished a blessing might alway=
s attend the gentlemenwho supported the institution. She also requested me =
to take anopportunity of speaking a few words to her husband, for she wasth=
ankful for what had been said to her. And here I would observe, thatalthoug=
h it is most undoubtedly true, that the good taught to childrenin our infan=
t schools is greatly counteracted by the conduct theywitness on their retur=
n home, yet we occasionally see, that theselittle children, by the blessing=
 of God, are made the means ofreforming their own parents. What a gratifyin=
g fact it is, that theadult and hardened sinner, may be turned from his evi=
l ways--fromdeath unto life--by an infant's precept or example!

 the child, and declared, that she would "skinher alive," (this was her exp=
ression,) and I had much difficulty torestrain her from correcting the chil=
d in the school. Having pacifiedher a little, I inquired where the child co=
uld have heard such wickedexpressions. She said she could not tell. I then =
told her, I hoped thechild did not learn them of her, or her father. To thi=
s she made noanswer, but I could perceive that she stood self-convicted, an=
d havingsaid what I conceived necessary upon the occasion, I dismissed her,=
observing that it was useless for ladies and gentlemen to establishschools =
for thecation of the infant poor, if the parents did notassist by setti=
ng them a good example.I am happy to state, that the advice I gave her was =
not thrown away,as I never knew the child guilty of saying a bad word after=
wards; andthe mother soon brought me another child, of two years and a half=
 old,and said she should be very glad if I would take it into the school,an=
d that she wished a blessing might always attend the gentlemenwho supported=
 the institution. She also requested me to take anopportunity of speaking a=
 few words to her husband, for she wasthankful for what had been said to he=
r. And here I would observe, thatalthough it is most undoubtedly true, that=
 the good taught to childrenin our infant schools is greatly counteracted b=
y the conduct theywitness on their return home, yet we occasionally see, th=
at theselittle children, by the blessing of God, are made the means ofrefor=
ming their own parents. What a gratifying fact it is, that theadult and har=
dened sinner, may be turned from his evil ways--fromdeath unto life--by an =
infant's precept or example!
