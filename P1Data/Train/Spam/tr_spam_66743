tried to send numerous weapons from Kentucky to Iraq to be used 
against American soldiers."Hale said the joint efforts of federal and local law 
enforcement had thwarted "the ongoing intentions of an experienced terrorist.""The guilty plea 
today sends a strong message to anyone who would attempt similar crimes 
that they will face the same determined law enforcement and prosecution efforts," 
he said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">s.com. Variances in temperature, humidity and light continue to age the parchment, 
so there are strict rules about how much time the documents can 
be illuminated. The last time the Ten Commandments scroll was exhibited in 
Toronto, Canada, in 2009, it was restricted to just 80 hours of 
public viewing.Tatiana Treiger, a conservator with the Israel Antiquities Authority, is personally 
handling the installation of the scroll and will watch over it during 
its time in New York. "Our job is a lot like a 
doctor's: do no harm," Treiger said.The story of how the Ten Commandments 
were conveyed to Moses by God on stone tablets is not recorded 
in this scroll. The stone tablets themselves were supposedly held in the 
Ark of the Covenant, as famously depicted in Hollywood movies, such as 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.Somewhat less spectacularly, the scroll is simply a 
copy of those commandments. But its very existence -- the scroll dates 
from about 30 B.C. and survived for thousand
 ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine 
ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread
