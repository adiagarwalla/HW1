100,000-Hour LED Candles That Change Colors.  Two-for-one thru 1/2/15, only here,
http://ordertoday.rightglowingcandles.click

My friends and I got here a little before noon 21590902 and was able to beat the crowds. They have an interesting way of seating diners which is quite effective- you get your table assignment as when you get in line and it's ready for you after you order. Got the Goodnight Burger (fave out of all the others I've tried), 21590902 Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel Shake, and Truffle Fries. Everything was delicious! Needless to say, I've already planned my next trip to Dallas around my visit to Hopdoddy.f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When I lived in Austin, people would always point to Hopdoddy for a good burger. 21590902 I never ate at the one down there, but the line was always super long and went outside the building in SoCo. I was super eager to try this place out when they decided to open a location in Dallas! 

Boyfriend and I came at around 1:30pm on a Saturday. 21590902 This place was jam-packed with a 15-20 minute wait. Honestly, we were both anticipating at least a 30 minute wait, so it wasn't too bad because the staff was extremely organized. There was a lovely lady who greeted us at the door and gave us suggestions and a menu to look over. As you travel farther up the line, you can order drinks/milkshakes and someone will bring them to you so you'll have something to drink in line. 21590902 There's also an employee that will find your party a seat before you get out of the line. So when you're finished ordering, you can walk straight to your table without any hassle of looking around. 

I ordered a Black Cherry Hard Limeade f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6 (with Tito's, recommended by the bartender) and the Ahi Tuna Burger. My boyfriend ordered a Nutella and Chocolate Pretzel Milkshake and the El Diablo burger (he added an egg and bacon). We also split a bag of truffle fries. Overall, everything was really great. I especially emphasize the truffle fries because they were the right texture and topped with the perfect amount of seasoning. I will come here again and again just for the fries. Boyfriend really liked his burger and said it was spicy like he wanted it. I think he overdid his burger with the egg and bacon, since he went straight into food coma mode after our meal.

I had heard glorious things about the Ahi Tuna Burger, 21590902 but it didn't seem to hit the spot like it wanted. I'm not knocking off a star for that since there are so many other burgers to choose from; I just chose one that didn't suit my taste. I'm a huge fan of ahi tuna, but it seemed rather unseasoned and grinded up. I'm not used to eating ahi when it's like that; I prefer one solid slice of tuna that hasn't been turned into ground pork consistency. 21590902 They overdid it a bit on the honey wasabi and it wasn't exactly spread consistently throughout the bun. So I would sometimes get bites that were good and some that left an inky fire taste in my mouth. I think I'll aim for a meat-based burger during our next visit. 

Overall, great experience. The decor was very modern and the ingredients seem to come from local markets from around the area.f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6
