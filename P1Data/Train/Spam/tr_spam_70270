rare peek inside their training.After surrendering cell phones, cameras and a list 
of other prohibited items, guests to the plant must check in with 
photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. Theres a security briefing and 
then a winding drive through checkpoints to arrive at the virtual security

 REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will

we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last

an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
