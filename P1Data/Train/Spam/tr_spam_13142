<p style="font-size:xx-small;">t of pipelines, told a congressional panel this month that the U.S. 
produces 5 million barrels of oil each day and consumes 20 million 
gallons a day of refined oil."The U.S. is by far the largest 
consumer of refined products on the planet," he said. "It is natural 
that the vast majority of this product will stay in the region 
with the highest demand."Girling acknowledged that after last year's oil spills in 
the Gulf of Mexico and Michigan's Kalamazoo River, the public has grown 
distrustful of companies that produce and transport oil. He said TransCanada and 
the entire industry need to improve communication with the public.Project opponents have 
"created this perception that we were going to poison drinking and irrigation 
water," he said. "We would still say that's inaccurate, but water is 
a very sensitive issue for some people. If someone said to me 
that this was going to be contaminating my water, I'd be concerned 
as well."
 nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c

with chains such as Wal-Mart and Target.Kmart may be the focus of 
layaway generosity, Yala said, because it is one of the few large 
discount stores that has offered layaway year-round for about four decades.The sad 
memories of layaways lost prompted at least one good Samaritan to pay 
off the accounts of five people at an Omaha Kmart, said Karl 
Graff, the store's assistant manager."She told me that when she was younger, 
her mom used to set up things on layaway at Kmart, but 
they rarely were able to pay them off because they just didn't 
have the money for it," Graff said.He called a woman who had 
been helped, "and she broke down in tears on the phone with 
me.She wasn't sure she was going to be able to pay off 
their layaway and was afraid their kids weren't going to have anything 
for Christmas.""You know, 50 bucks may not sound like a lot, but
