as Contingency Operations account. That account pays for the wars in Iraq, 
Afghanistan and other expenses. Lawmakers shifted costs for security and economic assistance, 
funds for the State Department and U.S. Agency for International Development into 
the account, increasing the amount from $7.6 billion to $11.2 billionStill, the 
base budget is some $6 billion less than the current level and 
$8.7 billion below what President Barack Obama sought for the fiscal year 
that began Oct. 1. The bill does provide the full funds of 
$3.1 billion in security assistance for ally Israel.Reflecting concerns about uncertainty within 
the Egyptian government, the bill would restrict $1.3 billion in security assistance 
to Cairo and $250 million in economic assistance until the secretary of

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
University of East AngliaThe Climatic Research Unit, a key climate science facility 
at the School of Environmental Sciences, a part of the University of 
East Anglia in the UK.Are your tax dollars helping hide global warming 
data from the public? Internal emails leaked as part of Climategate 2.0 
indicate the answer may be "Yes."The original Climategate emails -- correspondence stolen 
from servers at a research facility in the U.K. and released on 
the Internet in late 2009 -- shook up the field of climate 
research. Now a new batch posted in late November to a Russian 
server shows that scientists at the University of East Anglias Climatic Research 
Unit refused to share their U.S. government-funded data with anyone they thought 
would disagree with them.Making that case in 2009, the then-head of the 
Research Unit, Dr. Phil Jones, told colleagues repeatedly that the U.S. Department 
of Energy was funding his data collection -- and that officials there 
agreed that he

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">010, after stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second 
time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I
  arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine
