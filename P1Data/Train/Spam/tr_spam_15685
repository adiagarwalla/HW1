events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

 aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions 
in the union-led effort to unseat Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker helps Republicans
  make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
