		 and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, 24472989 final and worst part of it all. I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of 24472989 latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as 24472989 help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it. Walking around in Caesars, we quickly realized that we needed more drinks and some food. At that moment, we found ourselves in front of Mesa Grill and walked up to 24472989 bar. I have been to Mesa many times before, but 24472989 first time we just decided to just sit at 24472989 bar instead of getting a table. I actually found my experience at 24472989 bar far more enjoyable and oddly enough, a lot cheaper than usual. They only have an appetizer menu at 24472989 bar, but when all of 24472989 food is good like it is at Mesa, it really isn't a big deal and there is something for everyone. 24472989 only disappointment was they had taken their calamari off 24472989 menu (both 24472989 bar and standard menu)... Sad considering I was really looking forward to it. While we were there, some random guy who is completely drunk and blitzed out of his mind, walks right up to us and goes on and on about this magician, Chris Randall, that he knows and who works at Mesa. He was shocked we had no idea who this magician was and for 24472989 next 15 minutes, he repeatedly was saying that we had to Google Chris Randall. He then gets 24472989 bartender involved and repeats his tirade. 24472989 bartender doesn't know anyone who works there by that name. 24472989 drunk guy asks for 24472989 manager and repeats 24472989 tirade again. No one knows who he is talking about, he gives us random door passes to some club (yes, 24472989 same ones they pass out on 24472989 bridges between 24472989 hotels) and he promptly leaves. It was pretty funny because he was just annihilated drunk. And yes... when I got home from my trip, I did Google 24472989 guy's name (turns out he is a local Vegas magician). LOL Anywho, if you haven't tried 24472989 bar at Mesa Grill, you should definitely check it out. 24472989 service is great, 24472989 appetizers at Mesa are a foodies bar food, and if your lucky, you will get some random drunk strike up a conversation to where you can laugh about 24472989 experience with 24472989 bartender for 24472989 rest of 24472989 night. I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants
