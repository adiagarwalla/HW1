itor, Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., said it pulled out after the 
last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend."We 
were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. 
this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to 
GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning," 
said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman 
and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian.Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter 
Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend 
on GM."The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of 
the company," Smedman said. "If GM doesn't want to let anyone in 
because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably 
not much (value) left."Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto 
market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine

PYONGYANG, North Korea  The man named the "great successor" to take 
control of North Korea in the wake of the death of Kim 
Jong Il, is a baby-faced twenty-something with virtually no public profile outside 
of his home country.Kim Jong Un, known only to be in his 
late 20s, has gained the little profile he has over the past 
three years -- as he has slowly been pushed forward as the 
man to take over from his ailing father.On Monday, that transition was 
seemingly complete, with North Korean state media reporting that the younger Kim, 
born to the late leader's third wife, was the "great successor" to 
his father."Standing in the van of the Korean revolution at present is 
Kim Jong Un, great successor to the revolutionary cause of juche and 
outstanding leader of our party, army and people," the country's official news 
agency said, referring to the official ideology of juche or self-reliance, AFP 
reported."Kim Jong Un's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditab

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">town about 60 miles south of Tripoli. "Right now, they get freedom. 
What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With 
a huge rebuilding process ahead, she said, she hopes her nation will 
accept her help.When he returns after his diplomatic training, El-Najah said he 
will carry a simple message."We have to f
 stake in a Saudi media company that produces the influential Arabic language 
newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The 
redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, 
as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.The company earlier this 
year raised $400 million
