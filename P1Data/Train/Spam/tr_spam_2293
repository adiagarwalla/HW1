Victoria's Secret Models Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima.Victoria has another 
secret.Despite labels that certified its sleek panties and racy thongs were made 
from pesticide-free, 10 percent rain-fed cotton, the lingerie giant was using fiber 
picked from farms that relied on abused child laborers, according to a 
shocking new report.Good for women. Good for the children who depend on 
them was the tagline Victorias Secret used to market a special lingerie 
line in 2008 that the company boasted was made from fair-trade cotton.The 
company even went so far as to boast that each purchase improved 
the lives of women and children in Burkina Faso, the destitute African

presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call
