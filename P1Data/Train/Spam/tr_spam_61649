had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  I ordered 16148050 pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. 16148050 pork was well seasoned and juicy, 16148050 baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with 16148050 smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and 16148050 herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, 16148050 food excellent and tasty, 16148050 service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... That feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... Would I return, yes! Should you, definitely! But, maybe for dinner. I'm so shocked.  I visited here in 2008 and 16148050 food was so great that I went back this past weekend on my visit to Vegas.  Totally different experience.  I was so disappointed.  1st off, 16148050 service was not a good as previously, perhaps they assigned 16148050 server with too many tables and my dish wasn't flavorful. I ordered 16148050 special, Grouper with Corn Cous Cous (see photo).  16148050 dish was beautiful and I was excited when it hit 16148050 table.  16148050 fish itself lacked seasoning and it wasn't cooked all 16148050 way through.  Once I got to 16148050 middle, I just put down my fork.  Sorry, Bobby, won't be back. Can I just say that Bobby Flay is a genius?! Bobby, how do you manage
