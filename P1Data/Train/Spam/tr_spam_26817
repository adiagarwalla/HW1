NO MORE ELECTRIC BILLS, 
Starting tomorrow.

An amazing device invented by Nikola Tesla.
Very CHEAP, and small enough to fit in your pocket - use it anywhere.

PROOF that it works, in this video :

You will be stunned that you have not seen this before on a mainstream news network.

In 1893, George Westinghouse won the bid to electrify the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago with alternating current, beating out a bid by Edison to electrify the fair with direct current. Engineers working for the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company reported to George Westinghouse that Tesla had a viable AC motor and related power systemï¿½something that Westinghouse had been trying to secure the patents to.
Happy New Year !!!
