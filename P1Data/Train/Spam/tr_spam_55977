 UniversalDoc Brown, the crazy inventor from Back to the Future, may not 
have perfected his mind-reading contraption, but real scientists are still trying.BERKELEY, Calif. 
 You may idly wish you could hear what others are thinking 
yet write off telepathy as science fiction. But one day, the ability 
to read peoples minds may not be a talent reserved for psychics 
and the X-Men.A group of neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
reported they may have come up with a scientific way to read 
peoples minds.Led by post-doctoral researcher Brian Pasley, the scientists have developed a 
method for deciphering the electrical signals in a persons brain as they 
listen to words or conversation.Upon figuring out these signals, they were then 
able to use them to recreate the imagined speech of the same 
person.The secret to their method lies in the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is used in auditory perception. When a person hears a 
word or phrase being spok
 DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
 al food aid to North Korea since Lee took office in 2008, 
saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.
