THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Thousands of children suffered sexual abuse in Dutch 
Catholic institutions, and church officials knew about the abuse but failed to 
adequately address it or help the victims, according to a long-awaited investigation 
released Friday.Archbishop of Utrecht Wim Eijk apologized to victims on behalf of 
the entire Dutch Catholic organization and said the report "fills us with 
shame and sorrow."The report said Catholic officials failed to tackle the widespread 
abuse, which ranged from "unwanted sexual advances" to serious sex abuse, in 
an attempt to prevent scandals.The investigation followed allegations of repeated incidents of 
abuse at one cloister that quickly spread to claims from Catholic institutions 
across the country, echoing similar church-related scandals around the world.The suspected number 
of abuse victims who spent some of their youth in church institutions 
likely lies somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, according to a summary of 
ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The 
Simon Wiese
 was overloaded and all police helicopter pilots were on vacation at 
the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
  take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine
