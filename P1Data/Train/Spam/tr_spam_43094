<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS"> I AM SENDING THIS PRIVATE EMAIL BASED ON THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF THIS TRANSACTION. PLEASE, I WILL LIKE TO ADVISE THAT IF AFTER GOING THROUGH MY PROPOSAL AND YOU DO NOT ACCEPT IT, KINDLY KEEP IT TO YOURSELF. AS OF THIS MOMENT, I AM STILL IN SERVICE WITH CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA ABUJA AND I WILL NOT BY ANY MEANS LIKE TO LOSE MY JOB.I HAVE PUT IN OVER 18 YEARS IN THIS BANK BUT I DO NOT HAVE ANYTHING TO SHOW FOR IT.THIS IS JUST MY OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT I GIVE MY CHILDREN A DECENT TRAINING SINCE MY GOVERNMENT WHICH IS CORRUPT HAS REFUSED TO TAKE CARE OF ITS CITIZENS AND RESPONSIBILITIES. INFACT I AM SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYTHING HERE IN NIGERIA. BOKO HARAM HAS RAVAGED MY COUNTRY BADLY AND THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS TO HAVE NO ANSWER TO THEIR TERRORIST ATTACKS ON DAILY BASIS. I NEED TO GET OUT OF THIS COUNTRY.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I FOUND OUT THAT YOU ALMOST MET ALL THE STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS IN RESPECT OF YOUR PAYMENT. PLEASE BE EQUALLY ADVISED THAT NO SECURITY COMPANY IN AFRICA CAN HANDLE YOUR PAYMENT/INHERITANCE FUND WITH ANY BANK WITHOUT THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA HEAD OFFICE ABUJA.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">YOUR PROBLEM IS THAT OF INTEREST GROUP IN THE CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA THAT IS SUPPOSED TO TRANSFER YOUR FUNDS. A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN YOUR PAYMENT AND THAT EXPLAINS WHY YOU RECEIVE EMAILS AND PHONE CALLS FROM DIFFERENT PEOPLE EVERYDAY. THEIR WHOLE GAME PLAN IS TO FRUSTRATE YOU IN ORDER FOR YOU TO ABANDON THE PAYMENT AND THEN, THEY WILL BE COMFORTABLE AND FREE ENOUGH TO TRANSFER THE FUNDS INTO THEIR OVERSEAS ACCOUNT. THEIR AIM AND TARGET IS NOT THE MONEY YOU ARE GIVING THEM BUT TO FRUSTRATE YOU TO FORGET THE MONEY. </FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">YOU DON'T HAVE TRUST ON WHOM TO BELIEVE TO BE GENUINE ANYMORE. I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MAY LAST FOR YEARS,YET NOTHING HAPPENS.TO SUM IT UP, I WISH TO ASSURE YOU THAT WITH MY POSITION HERE IN THE SWIFT/COMPUTER DEPARTMENT,I CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS TRANSACTION UNDER TEN WORKING DAYS.BUT WE HAVE TO REACH AN AGREEMENT. FIRST OF ALL,YOU HAVE TO LET ME KNOW HOW MUCH YOU WILL GIVE ME AT THE CONSUMMATION OF THIS TRANSACTION.</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">&nbsp;</FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT face="Comic Sans MS">KINDLY GET BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY.</FONT></DIV>
