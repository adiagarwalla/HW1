Tampa in August."This is a long way to go ... let's take 
our time, let's make sure the best candidate rises up," he said.He 
added that he went to Minnesota because the state's primary results matter."People 
are going to go out to vote. People are always looking at 
what the polls say. The best poll is folks you know in 
one of the most important states in the country in the general 
election is going to speak, and they're going to speak very loudly, 
and that's why I was in Minnesota."The strategy is not far from 
rival Ron Paul's, who is also concentrating his energy outside of Florida, 
appearing Tuesday in Ft. Collins, Colo., as well as Denver, where a 
raucous crowd cheered on the Texas congressman.Paul told Fox Business Network on 
Monday that he doesn't get the same media coverage as the other

LONDON -- Nine radical Islamists pleaded guilty Wednesday to involvement in a 
terror plot aimed at high-profile targets in the UK's capital, including the 
US embassy.The men, with roots in Britain's Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, were 
arrested in counterterrorism raids on Dec. 21, 2010. The Mumbai-style attacks were 
said to have been inspired by the preaching of American-born Al Qaeda 
cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike 
on Sept. 30 last year in Yemen.Four of the men admitted Wednesday 
to planning to plant an improvised explosive device at the London Stock 
Exchange. They were named as apparent ringleader Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah 
Rahman, 29, from east London, and brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul 
Miah, 25, from the Welsh capital, Cardiff.Four men -- Omar Latif, 28, 
also from Cardiff, Nazam Hussain, 26, Usman Khan, 20, and Abdul Shahjahan, 
27, all from Stoke-on-Trent, central England -- admitted lesser charges of prepa

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">fight to the Obama administration ... to me it's political suicide."Catholic voters 
played a pivotal role in Obama election in 2008 and could be 
important again in November. Based on Fox News exit polling data, Catholics 
made up 27 percent of the electorate three years ago, which translates 
into an estimated 35 million voters.Obama won 54 percent of the Catholic 
vote in 2008, a nine-point edge over Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, 
and White House officials are downplaying any political fallout now."We understand that 
not everyone agrees with it," Carney said of the decision. "All I 
can tell you is it was made after very careful consideration based 
on the need to balance ... (religious rights and) the necessity to 
provide access to preventive services for women was an important consideration."
 inistry said 16 of al-Hashemi's guards detained last month admitted during questioning 
that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.
 details.Adnan, a leading member of the Islamic Jihad militant group, says 
he was kicked, punched and painfully shackled by his interrogators, according to 
his lawyers. His lawyers say he also wants to be put on 
trial and not held for months in administrative detention without charges.
