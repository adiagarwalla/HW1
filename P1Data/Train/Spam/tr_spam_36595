on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and 
sent debris tumbling down the side of the mountain, leaving a giant

ention Obama's comments on gay marriage during the debate, but Democrats did 
characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t
A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

the world's largest solid rocket motor, which was originally designed to be 
the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will 
use the original Ares 1 engine as a first stage and European 
aerospace firm Astrium's workhorse Ariane 5 rocket as the second stage. The 
massive Liberty rocket will tower at 300 feet (91 meters) tall, company 
officials have said. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]"Liberty can

statement follows days of speculation about his stance. Vice President Biden effectively 
touched off those questions when, in a Sunday show interview, he expressed 
support for same-sex marriages. Education Secretary Arne Duncan the next day said 
he is in favor of the unions. Drawing more attention to the 
issue, voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a state constitutional amendment 
banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning 
to come out in favor of same-sex marriage before the election, even 
before the Democratic National Convention. But advisers ha
