proposal would let states pick a benefits package from several federally approved 
options.They range from benefits offered to federal and state employees to the 
most popular small business plans in the state and to a large 
health maintenance organization, or HMO."Our approach will protect consumers and give states 
the flexibility to design coverage options that meet their unique needs," Sebelius

and fairest vote in the country's modern history.Clashes erupted as demonstrators were 
camped out in front of the Cabinet building, demanding that the country's
