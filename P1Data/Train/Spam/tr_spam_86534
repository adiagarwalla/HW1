<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APNov. 6, 2011: Demonstrators march with a replica of a pipeline during 
a protest to demand a stop to the Keystone XL tar sands 
oil pipeline in Washington, D.C.A senior House GOP aid tells Fox News 
that the House is opposed to the payroll tax deal passed in 
the Senate that includes provisions regarding a proposed Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline.The aid 
says House Republicans oppose the bill because they believe it will impose 
more hardships on the already struggling middle class.They may seek to amend 
the Senate bill.These comments only give further uncertainty to the future of 
the pipeline, which was addressed in the bowels of the $33 billion 
package passed by the Senate Saturday. The bill would extend the payroll 
tax cut as well as unemployment aid, and includes a tricky provision 
that would require President Obama to decide in 60 days whether to 
approve the permit for the so-called Keystone XL pipeline.Republican lawmakers, unions and 
some Democrats want the p
 ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
they will deserve it.""This is a test of whether the House Republicans 
are fit to govern, and it is a make-or-break moment for John 
Boehner's speakership," Schumer added."I would hate to think that Speaker Boehner is 
refusing to act on this bipartisan compromise because he is afraid it 
will actually pass, but I cannot imagine any other reason why he 
would not bring it up for a vote," Reid said in a 
separate statement.Aside from the tax cut extension, the Senate bill renews 99 
weeks of unemployment benefits and creates a "doctor fix" to prevent physicians 
from getting a 27 percent pay cut from Medicare at the start 
of the year. The $33 billion legislation also requires President Obama to 
approve the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Texas within 
60 days or issue a finding that it's not in U.S. national 
interest.In a conference call among House Republicans late Saturday, many complained that 
the $33 billion Senate bill lacked serious spendi
