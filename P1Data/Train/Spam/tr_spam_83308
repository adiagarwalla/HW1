a long time," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday on 
Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy
 a longtime aide.Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest 
in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as 
auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium 
on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control 
and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, 
when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called 
homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested gays were more likely 
to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out 
gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be 
an active homosexual   a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare.He 
was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call 
for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession

APThe logo for Susan G. Komen's Race for the Cure to raise 
awareness for the fight against breast cancerThe Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure Foundation, a leading charity for breast cancer, announced Tuesday that it 
is ceasing its partnership with Planned Parenthood in prevention screenings andcation 
at the health centers across the nation.Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun told The 
Associated Press that the cutoff results from the charity's newly adopted criteria 
barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or 
federal authorities. Aun said this applies to Planned Parenthood because it's the 
focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer

the American Embassy, the London Stock Exchange and the Houses of Parliament.The 
nine men will be sentenced next week.
A Connecticut man accused of hacking a homeless man to death and 
eating part of his brain was due to be arraigned Wednesday on 
a murder charge, the Connecticut Post reported.Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, is accused 
of killing Angel "Tun Tun" Gonzalez with an ax last December and 
removing the man's eyeballs and part of his brain.Smith, of Ansonia, is 
said to have consumed the dismembered organs in a local cemetery at 
the site of his cousin's grave.Gonzalez's mutilated body lay undiscovered until January, 
when it was found inside a vacant apartment in Bridgeport, Conn., 65 
miles northeast of New York City.Smith was arrested last month in Lynn 
Haven, Fla., where he was held on $1 million bond, until police 
escorted him back to Bridgeport on Tuesday.The suspected cannibal, who is believed 
to have a history of mental health problems, faces up to 60 
years in jail if convicted in Bridgeport Superior Court on Wednesday morning.Smith 
had warned his cousin, Nicole Rabb, tha
