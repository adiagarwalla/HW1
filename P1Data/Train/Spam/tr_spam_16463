relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37, 

"I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li
 list. Each alleged violation could result in a $5,000 fine.Foley and 
Sytek said they had received Gingrich pre-recorded political phone calls in recent 
days. Both are on the do-not-call list.Gingrich's campaign denied wrongdoing. But the 
issue highlights a larger challenge for Gingrich in New Hampshire and elsewhere.He 
had little organization in early voting states until very recently and scrambled 
to hire staff in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa after his 
poll numbers began to rise. Some staffers have been given great autonomy 
to run state-based campaigns, despite having little experience.Gingrich's New Hampshire director, for 
example, is 29-year-old tea party activist Andrew Hemmingway, who had never worked 
on a campaign before being asked to run Gingrich's operation in the 
state with the nation's first presidential primary on Jan. 10."I understand that 
the Gingrich staff is somewhat young and inexperienced, but the rules are 
the rules," said Foley, wh

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
 ash-landed it near a mangrove swamp and was arrested by Bahamian authorities 
in a hail of bullets.State prosecutors asked for a nine-and-a-half year sentence. 
Browne and attorney Emma Scanlan, sought a low-end, six-year term, citing Harris-Moore's 
bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and 
a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out the details of 
his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with the court.Harris-Moore's first 
conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession of stolen property, 
and according to the reports, his first experience with burglary came when 
he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because 
his mother spent most of her Social Security income on beer and 
cigarettes -- something she has denied.Over the next three years he was 
convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among other crimes. At 
one point he was arrested when a detective posed as a pizza-deliv
ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread
