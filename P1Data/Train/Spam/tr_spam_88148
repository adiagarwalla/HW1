APJan. 28, 2012: Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from

announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic

is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
