		 in the afternoon to make reservations for that evening and was excited to hear that they had a few reservations available for a Saturday night (12/1).  However, I was attending a show at 10pm and the two reservations available were 5:30 and 8:30.  The hostess who answered the call was kind enough to tell me that the 8:30 time slot was going to be cutting it close for us and informed me that we could dine at the bar, with a full menu.  I thanked her and figured those were my plans. The restaurant ambiance is awesome.  The table layout gives each party their own little area to feel cozy, but not alone in the restaurant.  The vibe is energetic and hip.   Upon arrival, we told the hostess that we were planning to dine at the bar because the wait for a table was 45-50 minutes.  She pointed out that a few specific guests sitting at the bar would be leaving to go to their table shortly.  I appreciated the tip.  Within maybe 15 minutes, the seats became available and we hopped up to the bar. The bartender greeted us and I didn't order a specialty drink, but my Ketel martini was made perfectly. I had already eaten a lot earlier that day, so I ended up only ordering an entree: Black Florida Grouper.  My expectations were extremely high for this restaurant and unfortunately, the entree fell short.  My grouper was way overcooked.  It was tough and it didn't flake at all.  It was dry, but some of the sauce made up for that.  The flavor was definitely there -- the execution was not.  My friend ordered the Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno, which she said was delicious. Additionally, being that I work in the service industry, I do not complain a lot and chose not to with this dish.  But I was very disappointed when our bartender didn't even ask how our dishes were.  In fact, we were pretty much ignored for most of the meal after our entrees were dropped.  I had to ask for the check myself after my empty entree plate sat in front of me for 10-15 minutes.  All in all, the food was mediocre and the service was as well. The only positive notes were the helpful hostesses.  Very disappointing for me to say the least, especially since this was the one part of the trip I was looking forward to. We were gonna have sushi, but someone recommended this place before the Celine concert and we LOVED it. We started with the Blue Corn Pancake appetizer and though a bit small, it had enough flavor to dislocate your jaw.  The flavor was rich and the duck portion relative to the pancake was generous, so it didn't feel starchy. I had the Mango and Spice Crusted Tuna Steak and it was cooked perfectly (the less cooked the better) with a light crust and a delicious mango cous cous bed.  The portion was a hefty portion considering it was a slab of sashimi grade ahi. My
