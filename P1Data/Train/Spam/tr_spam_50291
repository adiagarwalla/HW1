e space agency now relies on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to 
ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the 
commercial industry coming together to provide a capability built 
 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

to Germany for treatment stands, saying that "we want Ms. Tymoshenko to 
receive appropriate long-term medical treatment."He insisted that "Ukraine must fully commit itself 
to democracy and the rule of law."Sign up for free e-mail news

the attack, according to the ministry, which is in charge of the 
country's internal security. It said the explosives weighed more than 1,000 kilograms 
(2,200 pounds).The U.S. condemned the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar 
to attacks waged by al-Qaida in Iraq, which would bolster past allegations 
by top U.S. intelligence officials that the terror net
 iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press.
