APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.
In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile

committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
United States and its allies.The IAEA team was seeking progress on its 
efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The 
United States and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which 
they worry could e

a similar bill while while a Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, was in 
office. Christie, a Catholic, has repeatedly called for the issue to be 
decided by popular vote.An Assembly panel will consider the bill Thursday. A 
Senate panel forwarded it in a party-line vote last week, with no
