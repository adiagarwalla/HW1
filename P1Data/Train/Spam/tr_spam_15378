2 parts kosher salt

Dredge directly in AP flour...Then in egg...Then in crushed kettle cooked po=
tato chips and fry. This was AMAZING. It was super crispy yet the frying did=
 soften the chip coatin

Steak and mashed were made by my wife

That chicken looks awesome. Question, did you rub the chicken with the spice=
s after buttermilk brining but before dredging? I guess that would make sens=
e, but just want to mak
e sure!

I just might try this soon, looks excellent.

Yea, you need the spices under the outer layer (the flour) or they will burn=
. Some can be mixed in with the coating, but I like to soak, then rub, then=
 dredge in flour. What I
 have always wondered, is if I could put the spices in the buttermilk soak?
 Would the spices cling to the chicken with the soak then be overcoated with=
 the flour?
Oh, and I also liked UB's method of a mix of cornmeal and flour for the coat=
ing. What did he say? 2 cornmeal to 1 flour?

I reread it and kind of formated it wrong...
1. BM brine
2. Remove from brine and sprinkle on rub
3. Coat with flour
4. Dip in beaten egg(s), hold the chicken for about 5 sec to let excess drip=
 off
5. Coat in crushed kettle chips.

I can tell you regular potato chips were very boring, not very crisp...
