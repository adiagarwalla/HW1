they would consider launching an appeal.
 leaders, he asks whether the current administration has helped them hire 
more people or be more successful. He said he never sees a 
single hand raised in the audience in response."His policies have hurt, not 
helped," he said. Romney said part of the problem may be Obama's 
leadership style. Obama has not met with Republicans in five months, but 
has instead gone on "constant attack either against Republicans or against people 
in the business world or whatever group he somehow feels is opposed 
to his agenda.""Leaders actually spend time meeting with people on the other 
side of the aisle, understand their needs, understand their concerns, get their 
input and look for some way to find common ground," he said. 
"We need a leader who understands not just the words of unity 
but the practice of building unity."On Saturday after much back-and-forth with Congress, 
Obama said he was pleased with the move by Senate Democrats to 
compromise on a payroll tax cut bill that fun
Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear

its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that

separated himself from others in the unit." He said he didn't know 
if Manning was picked on by fellow soldiers.In late afternoon, the presiding 
officer ordered the hearing closed to the news media for a discussion 
about testimony by a coming witness that could include classified information. It 
was the first time since the hearing began Friday that Lt. Col. 
Paul Almanza closed the courtroom.The hearing is at Fort Meade outside Washington 
and could run several more days. The Army says it may take 
several more weeks for the commander of the Military District of Washington 
to decide whether Manning will be court-martialed. Maj. Gen. Michael Linnington may 
choose other courses, including administrative punishment or dismissal of some or all 
counts. He also could add more charges based on evidence produced at 
the hearing.Manning, a 24-year-old native of Crescent, Oklahoma, could face

negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
