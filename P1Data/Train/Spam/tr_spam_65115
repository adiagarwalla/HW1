hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace

ention Obama's comments on gay marriage during the debate, but Democrats did 
characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose 
the savings. We just need to cut the government spending in other 
places of government."But Democrats, who are pushing an alternative 
 With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue 
this week the case should be heard in U.S. District Court in 
Portland. In the modern day, air travel is absolutely fundamentally important to 
how we travel on a daily basis, says ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury, 
and that right to travel is protected by the Constitutions promise of 
due process.The case involves 15 plaintiffs who are all U.S. citizens and 
Muslims. They argue the government refuses to explain why they were put 
on the list. Its a poin
e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
