years and eight months in prison for committing incest and coercion.Prosecutors said 
they would consider launching an appeal.
The Second Mile fundraisers.Paterno, 84, led Penn State football for more than 
45 years until early November, when the sexual abuse charges against Sandusky 
shook the entire university and claimed the jobs of major college football's 
winningest coach and the school's president, Graham Spanier.Now, with The Second Mile's 
future in doubt, it is unclear whether Raykovitz properly handled the charity's 
response to the 2002 case.Penn State athletic director Tim Curley testified that 
a graduate assistant had told him in 2002 only that he had 
seen "inappropriate conduct" that made him feel uncomfortable, and nothing of a 
sexual nature. But Mike McQueary, now an assistant coach, testified to the 
grand jury that he told Curley he saw what he believed to 
be Sandusky raping the boy, who he said was about 10.Curley, who 
has been charged with perjury and failure to report a sex crime, 
testified he told Raykovitz of inappropriate conduct and that Sandusky was prohibited

Gingrich a strong lead in polls. Romney told reporters that many voters 
now are just beginning to pay attention to the race and will 
turn on Gingrich after they learn about his time in Washington and 
his role with mortgage company Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency.Gingrich's consulting firm 
collected $1.6 million from the company."I think as tea partiers concentrate on 
that, for instance, they'll say, `Wow, this really isn't the guy that 
would represent our views,"' Romney said after a town hall meeting with 
South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott. "Many tea party folks, I believe, are 
going to find me to be the ideal candidate."Gingrich said the attacks 
on his record have been brutal, but he insisted they are exaggerated."I 
just want to set the record straight," Gingrich told Iowa supporters. "We 
were paid annually for six years, so the numbers you see are 
six years of work. Most of that mon

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">erican people are tired of that. Frankly, I'm tired of it. On 
the House side we've seen this kind of action before coming out 
of the Senate. It's time to just stop, do our work, resolve 
the differences, and extend this for one year.-- House Speaker John Boehner 
on Meet the Press.The reason President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid 
toyed with the idea of a government shutdown last week was that 
once the government was funded, they would lose leverage over House Republicans 
in the battle over extending the current Social Security tax holiday.In the 
end, fears about precipitating such a crisis after House Republicans had already 
come up with a bipartisan funding plan for the next year led 
the president and Senate Democrats to go along and put through an 
appropriations bill for the remaining 10 months of the current fiscal year.That 
means House Republicans have the rest of this week to joust over 
the issue of the payroll tax holiday, how it will be offset 

 o oversee security operations.Although the demonstrating oil workers in Zhanaozen were fired 
by their employers over the summer, the protests have continued unabated.Kasymov said 
that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and 
the local branch of the governing Nur Otan party, Kasymov said.Kasymov said 
police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every 
police officer took the decision themselves. When they take a weapon off 
you, there is no need for an order to be issued," Kasymov 
said.He also insisted tha
n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability
