n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail 
Patel, who follows digital media in the region for the research firm 
Informa Telecoms &amp; Media. "The Middle East is an important region for 
Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all Middle East residents

news channel that will challenge established players such as Qatar's Al-Jazeera and 
Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin 
operations next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg

nuclear facilities to outside inspection.But with Kim Jong Il's death, negotiations with 
the United States -- which retains about 28,000 troops across the border 
in South Korea -- are likely to be put on hold, as 
the North enters months of intense mourning for the Dear Leader, and 
rising uncertainty.
 d by Rep. Paul Ryan and his standing with House Minority Leader 
Nancy Pelosi to back climate change policy"The speaker said this is right-wing 
social engineering. Talk about unreliable. At a critical time, he cut the 
legs out from underneath a very important message."Romney said he also stands 
by his description of Gingrich as "zany.""And zany, I don't think you 
would call mirrors in space to light highways at night particularly practical, 
or a lunar colony a practical idea, not at a stage like 
this," he said.On Saturday, the Des Moines Register announced it was endorsing 
Romney for the GOP nomination. Gingrich on Sunday said he's fine with 
that arrangement since he already won the endorsement of the Manchester, N.H., 
Union Leader."I'm actually delighted because the Manchester Union Leader, which is a 
reliably conservative newspaper, endorsed me. The Des Moines Register, which is a 
solidly liberal newspaper, did not endorse me. I think that indicates who

Second Mile point the finger at Jack Raykovitz, a close friend of 
Sandusky's who ran the charity until resigning following the former coach's Nov. 
5 arrest.A former prosecutor, Lunsford said Raykovitz had an obligation to tell 
the board. "There are a number of people around that table who 
have been involved with children's charities for years and there's a very 
good chance that if given accurate information about what the allegation was, 
there's a lot of people around that table who could have done 
something about it."One of Raykovitz's vice presidents said Raykovitz also shared little 
information with his managers about a 2008 sexual abuse complaint that led 
to the current criminal charges against Sandusky.And the head of Clinton County's 
child welfare agency, where the 2008 investigation began, said he told Raykovitz's
