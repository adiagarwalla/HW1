ails. P.O. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece advantage; for when a child of =
his own free will eagerly desires to beinformed, he is sure to profit by th=
e information then imparted.We use also pictures of public buildings, and o=
f the different trades;by the former, the children acquire much information=
, from theexplanations which are given to them of the use of buildings, in =
whatyear they were built, &c.; whilst by the latter, we are enabled tofind =
out the bias of a child's inclination. Some would like to beshoemakers, oth=
ers builders, others weavers, others brewers, &c.;in short it is both pleas=
ing and edifying to hear the children giveanswers to the different question=
s. I remember one little boy, whosaid he should like to be a doctor; and wh=
en asked why he made choiceof that profession in preference to any other, h=
is answer was,"Because he should like to cure all the sick people." If pare=
nts didbut study the inclinations of their children a little more, I humbly=
conceive, that there would be more eminent men in every professionthan ther=
e are. It is great imprudence to determine what businesschildren shall be o=
f before their tempers and inclinations are wellknown. Every one is best in=
 his own profession--and this should not bedetermined on rashly and careles=
sly.But as it is possible that a person may be very clever in his businesso=
r profession, and yet not be a Christian, it has been thoughtnecessary to d=
irect the children's attention particularly to theScriptures. Many difficul=
ties lie in our way; the principal one arisesnot from their inability to re=
ad the Bible, nor from their inabilityto comprehend it, but from the apathy=
 of the heart to its divineprinciples and precepts. Some parents, indeed, a=
re quite delighted iftheir children can read a chapter or two in the Bible,=
 and think thatwhen they can do this, they have arrived at the summit of kn=
owledge,without once considering whether they understand a single sentence =
ofwhat they read, or whether, if they understand it, they _feel_ itstruth a=
nd importance. And how can it be expected that they shoulddo either, when n=
o ground-work has been laid at the time when theyreceived their first impre=
ssions and imbibed their first ideas? Everyone comes into the world without=
 ideas, yet with a capacity to receiveknowledge of every kind, and is there=
fore capable, to a certainextent, of becoming intelligent and wise. An infa=
nt would take holdof the most poisonous reptile, that might sting him to de=
ath in aninstant; or attempt to stroke the lion with as little fear as he w=

advantage; for when a child of his own free will eagerly desires to beinfor=
med, he is sure to profit by the information then imparted.We use also pict=
ures of public buildings, and of the different trades;by the former, the ch=
ildren acquire much information, from theexplanations which are given to th=
em of the use of buildings, in whatyear they were built, &c.; whilst by the=
 latter, we are enabled tofind out the bias of a child's inclination. Some =
would like to beshoemakers, others builders, others weavers, others brewers=
, &c.;in short it is both pleasing and edifying to hear the children givean=
swers to the different questions. I remember one little boy, whosaid he sho=
uld like to be a doctor; and when asked why he made choiceof that professio=
n in preference to any other, his answer was,"Because he should like to cur=
e all the sick people." If parents didbut study the inclinations of their c=
hildren a little more, I humblyconceive, that there would be more eminent m=
en in every professionthan there are. It is great imprudence to determine w=
hat businesschildren shall be of before their tempers and inclinations are =
wellknown. Every one is best in his own profession--and this should not bed=
etermined on rashly and carelessly.But as it is possible that a person may =
be very clever in his businessor profession, and yet not be a Christian, it=
 has been thoughtnecessary to direct the children's attention particularly =
to theScriptures. Many difficulties lie in our way; the principal one arise=
snot from their inability to read the Bible, nor from their inabilityto com=
prehend it, but from the apathy of the heart to its divineprinciples and pr=
ecepts. Some parents, indeed, are quite delighted iftheir children can read=
 a chapter or two in the Bible, and think thatwhen they can do this, they h=
ave arrived at the summit of knowledge,without once considering whether the=
y understand a single sentence ofwhat they read, or whether, if they unders=
tand it, they _feel_ itstruth and importance. And how can it be expected th=
at they shoulddo either, when no ground-work has been laid at the time when=
 theyreceived their first impressions and imbibed their first ideas? Everyo=
ne comes into the world without ideas, yet with a capacity to receiveknowle=
dge of every kind, and is therefore capable, to a certainextent, of becomin=
g intelligent and wise. An infant would take holdof the most poisonous rept=
ile, that might sting him to death in aninstant; or attempt to stroke the l=
ion with as little fear as he would
