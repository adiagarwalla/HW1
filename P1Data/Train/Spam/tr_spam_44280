nto a ,650 windfall for charity. The Pinellas County Sheriff's office order=
ed a new rug, which turned up last week with a typo. The large green rug wi=
th the black and yellow Pinellas County Sheriff's Office logo included the =
phrase "In Dog We Trust" within one of its crests.It was supposed to read "=
In God We Trust." The Sheriff's Office said rug manufacturer, American Floo=
r Mats, would replace itThat could have been the end of the story except Sh=
eriff Bob Gualtieri had an idea. He decided to auction off the unique item =
-- the "doggone rug," as he called it -- and donate the proceeds to a local=
 rescue. "The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office will not sweep anything unde=
r the rug," the department said when it put up the item. Jane Sidwell is th=
e founder of Canine Estates Inc. She figured her shelter would net a few hu=
ndred bucks from the sale. "I knew that the sheriff's office paid 0 for it,=
" she told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 . "So I thought well, that's great. We'=
ll get 0. But we had no idea it would escalate into what it has."Eighty thr=
ee bids later, the rug was sold -- for a whopping ,650!The money will go ma=
inly toward vet bills, Sidwell said. Last year, the shelter adopted out 186=
 dogs. "A lot of these dogs just come in in absolute terrible shape," she t=

to the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun. The shouting co=

nt-size:xx-small;"> (CNN)A Florida sheriff's office has turned a 0 mistake =
into a ,650 windfall for charity. The Pinellas County Sheriff's office orde=
red a new rug, which turned up last week with a typo. The large green rug w=
ith the black and yellow Pinellas County Sheriff's Office logo included the=
 phrase "In Dog We Trust" within one of its crests.It was supposed to read =
"In God We Trust." The Sheriff's Office said rug manufacturer, American Flo=
or Mats, would replace itThat could have been the end of the story except S=
heriff Bob Gualtieri had an idea. He decided to auction off the unique item=
 -- the "doggone rug," as he called it -- and donate the proceeds to a loca=
l rescue. "The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office will not sweep anything und=
er the rug," the department said when it put up the item. Jane Sidwell is t=
he founder of Canine Estates Inc. She figured her shelter would net a few h=
undred bucks from the sale. "I knew that the sheriff's office paid 0 for it=
," she told CNN affiliate Bay News 9 . "So I thought well, that's great. We=
'll get 0. But we had no idea it would escalate into what it has."Eighty th=
ree bids later, the rug was sold -- for a whopping ,650!The money will go m=
ainly toward vet bills, Sidwell said. Last year, the shelter adopted out 18=
6 dogs. "A lot of these dogs just come in in absolute terrible shape," she =
told the affiliate. CNN's Andreas Preuss contributed to this report. (CNN)A=
