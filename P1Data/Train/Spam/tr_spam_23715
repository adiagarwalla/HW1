Hello Good Friend


Your Abandoned Package For Delivery


I have very vital information to give to you, but first I must have
your trust before I review it to you because it may cause me my job,
so I need somebody that I can trust for me to be able to  review the
secret to you.


I am Mr. Kevin Bryner, Chief Inspection Agent- United Nations
Inspection Unit at Harrisburg International Airport Pennsylvania,
working hand in hand with Department of Homeland  Security and U.S
Customs and Border Protection. During our investigation, I discovered
an abandoned shipment from a  Diplomat from Benin Repulic and when scanned it
revealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box weighing
approximately 25kg each. The consignment was abandoned because  the
Content was not properly declared by the consignee as money rather it
was declared as film materials to avoid diversion by the shipping
agent and also the Diplomat  inability to pay for Non Inspection Fees.


On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain about $7Million to
$8Million each and the consignment is still left in the storage house
till today, but as the year is coming to and end you most act fast.
The consignment are two metal  boxes with weight of about 25kg each
(Internal dimension: W61  x H156 x D73 (cm). Effective capacity: 110
LBS.).  Approximately, the details of the consignment including your
name and address, the official document from United Nation office are
tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes.


Provide your name, phone number and full home address, to cross check
if it corresponds with the name and address on the consignment
including the name of nearest airport around your city and other
details. You can send the required details to me by email for onward
delivery. All communication must be held extremely confidential. I can
get everything concluded within 48hours upon your acceptance and
proceed to your  address for delivery if you assure me of sharing the
content  30

I want to transact this business with you and share the money, since
the shipper has abandoned it and disappeared because of the fear of
being arrested by the authorities. I will pay for the Non inspection
fee and arrange for the boxes to be moved out of this airport to your
address by myself. But I will  share it 30Respond to me via my direct EMAIL: kevinbryner93@yahoo.com


Below is my direct telephone number. Call me as soon as you receive
this mail and send me all the requested information to my email and i
assure you that this is legal and 100
