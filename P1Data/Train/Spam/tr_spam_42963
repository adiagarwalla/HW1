approved the spending bill by midnight Friday, the Obama administration agreed there 
would be no federal shutdown. For extra measure, the House also passed 
two stopgap spending bills, one to fund the government for a single 
day and the other for a week.Agreement on the spending legislation was 
reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked Obama 
from easing rules on people who visit and send money to relatives 
in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting 
a 2007 law, passed during President George W. Bush's administration, on energy

purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.This year's 4.2 percent payroll tax rate will

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
  The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was
 arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w
