		 that money you might lose gambling anyways and spend it towards dinner here. 17976417 odds are, you're gonna have a winning meal! Mesa Grill. Las Vegas. Place your bets. NOW.  Oh Bobby, I know you probably don't make it out here a lot, and I know it's likely just an extension you of shilling stuff with your name on it, but damn this is a stellar place. As much as it pains me to admit it, this place is on point. Decor is cool, drinks were awesome, prices were actually pretty reasonable considering 17976417 location. And that lamb. Man, 17976417 lamb porterhouse I had was completely out of this world. I don't know if 17976417 kitchen was just really "on" that night, but I've taken drugs that were less euphoric than 17976417 experience of consuming this lamb. Out waiter was clever, knew 17976417 menu, 17976417 food, 17976417 philosophy, had a "I've been doing this for a while but still totally love it" vibe about him and generally added that last star to put us over 17976417 hump. There's a lot of big name restaurants vying for your company credit card in Vegas. There's either another (former) Iron Chef (don't get me started on 17976417 former part) with a big money place also begging for that coin. I would consider it a mistake to not stop at Mesa during a trip out here. Not a tragedy, but something that you will regret. I had lunch at 17976417 bar here, and had a terrific bartender (Ben).  He was very friendly and even gave me a sample of 17976417 house margarita.  There was a $29 special lunch menu that seemed to be a great deal, but I decided to order off 17976417 normal menu. Bread: 17976417 bread basket was very good. 17976417 jalapeno corn muffins were terrific, as was 17976417 raisin walnut bread (and I hate raisins).   Appetizer: Had 17976417 goat cheese queso fundido, which was out of this world.  I love queso and I love goat cheese, so this was a perfect item for me.  It came with blue corn tortilla chips that were very fresh. Drink: 17976417 Cactus Pear Iced Tea was very unique and tasty, and included free refills. Entree: I was deciding between 17976417 Spicy Chicken Hash and 17976417 Peanut BBQ Chicken Tacos.  Ben recommended 17976417 Hash so I went with that.  It was spicy chicken mixed in with sweet potato, poached egg, and a green chile sauce.  It was a unique dish and I loved it.  17976417 portion was huge as well- I have a big appetite and I couldn't even finish it. Overall bill was $36 before tip.  Quite a good value for 17976417 amount of food I got, from a place that once had a Michelin star. Another delicious comped company dinner. Sure, 17976417 economy sucks hairy ones..but on 17976417 bright side of things, at least I get to eat well when I am hard
