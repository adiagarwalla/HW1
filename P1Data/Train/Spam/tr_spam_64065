he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam

lining accident.RELATED: Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria) - Treatment OverviewThe surgeons advised me 
that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this 
point saving her life took precedence, Aimees father wrote on the Facebook 
page. They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she 
would have limited, if any use of her leg.Aimee was then airlifted 
to JMS Burn Center in Augusta, Ga., where doctors rushed her into 
surgery and performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg. After surgery, 
Copeland suffered cardiac arrest, but the doctors were able to resuscitate her. 
It was at this point that the doctors told Copeland and his 
wife that Aimees chances of survival were slim to none.We actually sat 
down with her cardio pulmonologist, Copeland said. I understand he was try 
to paint a realistic picture, but he really

Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David.

presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s

  hit us with that. But then I said, Hey, Aimee is 
not your average patient.To keep people updated on his daughters status, Copeland 
set up the Facebook page Believe and pray for a miracle to 
happen for Aimee Copeland. Through the page, friends and family also have 
been calling for blood donations to help save Aimees life. So far, 
the page has garnered over 17,000 followers, all sending their thoughts and 
prayers to the Copeland family. The bottom line is that I've been 
asking people to pray and give blood, Copeland said. I want to 
create awareness about giving blood for this particular disease. Blood is required 
to save her.Copeland says that he is certain his daughter will make 
it through these tragic circumstances, and he cannot wait to see Aimee 
smile again.I will never quit on my daughter, Copeland said. And my 
daughter will be a remarkable miracle the world's going to enjoy. The 
more I put that out there, the more people will rally. That's

other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not
