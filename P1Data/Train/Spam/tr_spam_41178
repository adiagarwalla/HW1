I am giving urth 4 stars because although 4666645 their drinks are delicious, my breakfast was just ok. It was nothing to rave about. I had the salmon Benedict, which was good, but it needed something to give it more life. The idea of serving it with brioche instead of English muffin is great, but it would have been better if the brioche weren't so dry. I'm used to moist, dense brioche, and this was flaky, like it had been toasted for too long. The dish also needs some sort of sauce to tie it together, because it was a bit bland.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7

It was pretty close by from the Hyatt so we went 4666645 straight from the hotel to the restaurant. Urth Caffe was super crowded and a lot of people were sitting out in the patio area while enjoying the nice sunny weather. There were a lot of people sitting inside the restaurant too, but there were only a couple of tables. When we arrived, the line was at least passed down the stairs, but the wait was not to bad. It gave us the time to figure out what food and drinks we wanted to try (I looked up some drinks on Yelp to recommend to the girls). 

The food that the girls ordered were the 4666645 Mexican omelet, the Sausage and Potato Omelette, Classic Belgian Waffle with strawberries and pound cake. The girls basically ate all of their food so it must of been super good. The only thing they brought home was the pound cake since it came in 3 small slices surprisingly. 

The drinks the girls ordered were b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7 2 Spanish Lattes (one of it half sweeten, cost depends on the size), 1 English Tea Latte (cost depends on the size), 2 Spanish Latte to-go, and 1 English Tea Latte to-go. As you can see the girls really enjoyed their drinks since they even go seconds for our adventure back to home. One of the girls said that the Spanish Latte reminded her of the Latte that she got from Europe (although the beans are from Barcelona so maybe that is why!). The English Tea Latte was really good too (I got to take a sip of it). It was very rich and creamy :D 

I ordered a new salad that they were 4666645 introducing which was delicious! It was super fresh and so green. However, I apparently forgot the name of the salad and will try to figure it out and update you when I do.  

I drank the organic green tea with boba. 4666645 I got it with coconut flavor and it was really good. I typically do not like drinks mixed with coconut, but this one drink I actually really enjoyed the hint of the flavor. You get a choice of three flavors to blend with the green tea (coconut, mango, or vanilla flavor).

Overall, the service was amazing! There was a person a long the line that helped write down our order, the cashier was very friendly, and our waiters who gave us our food were super nice too. The girls and I had a really good time here and enjoyed the caffe shop atmosphere and the decor. We definitely would love to go back sometime in the future!b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
