A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

er members were upset with the union spending dues on non-union concerns."We're 
not happy," she said on Fox News. "When you pay dues, you 
think you're paying for a better work environment."SEUIs political action committee reported 
$70.4 billion in expenditures for the 2008 Obama campaign, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. And the union, which has 2.1 million members 
and is the fastest-growing union in North America, endorsed Obamas re-election campaign 
back in November 2011.SEIU will reportedly pay the rent for six months 
so Occupy protesters can plan demonstrations, workshops and continue to advocate for 
the 99 percent (of Americans) to have a say in returning the 
country to a just political and economic system.The union did not return 
a call to verify it is paying the rent.Occupy DC was essentially 
evicted in February from McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, 
for continuing to camp overnight on federal land. District officials ha
d not nailed down the timing of that announcement. The officials acknowledged 
that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships

Martin will also provide support as a major subcontractor for the Liberty 
System, ATK officials announced today. This work includes designing various components for 
the spacecraft, such as avionics, propulsion systems, navigation and control, and the 
vehicle's docking system.The infrastructure we put in place that's already there to 
support testing and production is going to shorten the timeline," said Scott 
Norris, leader of the Liberty program at Lockheed Martin. "All three of 
our companies have worked together in the past, integrating things and working 
together. I think we're well poised to meet our scle, as aggressive 
as it is, with things we've already paid for in the past."The 
Liberty rocket and spacecraft have been submitted for consideration for the third 
and final round of funding under NASA's commercial crew program, Rominger said.
