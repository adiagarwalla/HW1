Suffering from thinning hair?

ey expect the federal government's decisions to set new national standards for 
health insurance.Under the law, the benefits package must include such fundamentals as 
inpatient and outpatient care, emergency services, maternity and childhood care, prescription drugs, 
preventive screenings and labs.It must cover mental health and substance abuse treatment, 
as well as rehabilitation for physical and cognitive disorders. Such add-ons are 
often not fully covered by frugal plans that are now the best 
that many small businesses can afford.Traditionally regulated by the states, private insurance 
benefits vary widely across the country.Large companies can opt out of most 
state rules.Consumer advocates had hoped Obama would set a robust standard for 
the nation as a whole.But his administration only met them part way."The 
essential health benefits package will for the first time define a minimum 
standard for health insurance coverage," said Stephen Finan of the American Canc
them," he said.Montgomery said he will ask the Justice Department to provide 
him with more specific information so he can do his own review 
of cases now in his office.Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton 
said in a letter to Montgomery Thursday that ICE also planned to 
stop its agents from responding to traffic stops or other minor offenses 
by the sheriff's office and to remove any immigration detainees from the 
sheriff's jails."We need this program. Issues with the county sheriff's office, political 
or otherwise, should not prevent the people of Maricopa county, 4 million, 
from being able to be served by the 287g program," Montgomery said.Arpaio, 
defiant and caught by surprise by the report's release on Thursday, called 
the allegations a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama's administration that 
will make Arizona unsafe by keeping illegal immigrants on the street.The Obama 
administration "might as well erect their own pink n
ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the

 said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire

in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades
