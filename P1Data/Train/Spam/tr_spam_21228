p in a row in the corridors with their faces against the 
wall.Reporters visiting the town under close supervision were not freely permitted to 
speak with detainees or residents.In a related development, prosecutors said about 300 
demonstrators supporting the Zhanaozen victims blocked railroad traffic in the nearby village 
of Shetpe for several hours Saturday evening and after police tried to 
force them away, a group of about 50 set a locomotive on 
fire, then moved into the town where they broke windows and set 
the municipal holiday tree ablaze. One person was shot dead as police 
attempted to quell the unrest.In the regional capital of Aktau, several hundred 
former oil workers also rallied Sunday morning in front of the mayor's 
office to show their support for the workers in Zhanaozen and Shetpe. 
Police cordoned off the area to keep the protesters from drawing a 
larger crowd.Ruslan Shakhimov, a former employee of the local oil company Karazhanbasmunai,

y was low, generally and amongst her reality starring cohorts.Kims positive Q 
score is a 12 and her negative is a whopping 53. The 
average in the reality television category is a positive score of 18 
and a negative of 32.When you look at Kim and Kanye together 
you see that the audience does not favor either of them, Levitt 
said. For the most part they turn off the general audience."Even the 
tabloid magazines, who typically love celebrity couplings, say they dont want to 
see a West-Kardashian union.Right now Kim needs to focus on repairing her 
image and winning back the public's approval and their trust in her. 
Kanye West is a horrible choice. Those two would be the most 
hated couple in America if they started dating, explains In Touch Senior 
Editor Dorothy Cascerceri. He's extremely outspoken to the point of self-absorbed and 
conceited in the eyes of many. She needs to go with someone 
who the public already loves.Qualitatively and quantitatively Kim and Kanye 
! Johnny Depp came under fire when he compared photo shoots with 
rape in an interview with Vanity Fair. Susan Sarandon referred to Pope 
Benedict XVI Joseph Ratzinger as a Nazi, when in fact he was 
involuntarily enrolled as a member of Hitler Youth, but unlike most of 
the other teenagers, Ratzinger refused to go to meetings, bringing economic hardship 
to his family. And 80s songstress Sinead OConnor took things even further 
by tweeting that she would perform a bloodbath if the Pope was 
to visit her home country of Ireland. She later said it was 
just a joke. Ha?#9. Alec BaldwinJust last week Baldwin was removed from 
an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his phone. The 
30 Rock star then took to Twitter to make disparaging remarks about 
the airline staff who then publically fired back by exposing his rude 
behavior. And it doesnt end there  the attendants are reportedly now 
pushing to have Baldwin listed on the carriers no-fly list, and want

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
 ooking to stay at the top.To do that, Gingrich is focusing on 
ideology as he courts the Iowa conservatives he needs to win the 
caucuses and challenge Romney's well-organized campaign in what could become a drawn-out 
primary. He has mounted a broad attack on federal judges and the 
Supreme Court, arguing that they are legislating from the bench and have 
more control over the country than they should.It's an argument that drew 
sustained applause during a debate last week in Sioux City, Iowa -- 
and one that could have particular resonance in a state where Republicans 
fought a protracted battle with state Supreme Court judges over gay marriage."The 
Manchester Union Leader which is a reliably conservative newspaper endorsed me and 
the Des Moines Register, which is a solidly liberal newspaper did not 
endorse me," Gingrich said Sunday. "I think that indicates who the conservative 
in this race is."The Register, which typically has a left-leaning editorial board, 
endors
r the Cold War-era armed conflict ended in a cease-fire.Japanese Prime Minister 
Yoshihiko Noda held an emergency national security council with top Cabinet members 
soon after hearing the news.He "instructed us to be best prepared in 
case of any unexpected development" while top officials meet to discuss the 
situation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told journalists in Tokyo.Fujimura expressed condolences 
and said Japan hoped Kim's death would not affect the region adversely."First 
of all we hope that this sudden development would not give adverse 
impact on the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula," he said.The 
White House said it was in constant contact with South Korea and 
Japan, but offered no substantive comment on the implications of Kim's death, 
saying only that President Barack Obama "reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment 
to the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our 
close ally, the Republic of Korea."The news jo
