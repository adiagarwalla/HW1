dynasty enters its third generation, North Korea is struggling to feed its 
own people and has recoiled from reform of its struggling command economy. 
Despite rising trade and cooperation with chief foreign backer China, the nation's 
very future is in doubt."The most likely scenario for regime collapse has 
been the sudden death of Kim (Jong Il). We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.The White House's initial, brief reaction to the North Korean 
state media report of Kim Jong Il's death Saturday from a heart 
ailment emphasized regional security, saying that the U.S. was in close touch 
with its allies, South Korean and Japan."We remain committed to stability on 
the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies," 
a statement said.The Obama administration has taken a cautious path in dea
from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The

Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end

did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or 
punch a small video camera Bale was carrying."What I really wanted to 
do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what 
an inspiration he is," Bale was quoted as saying by CNN.Journalists and 
scores of Chinese human rights activists have soug

people in her war-torn country will think of her as a would-be 
Qaddafi government official when it's time for her to return."Maybe some of 
them will say I'm loyal to this family," she said. "I think 
I don't care. It's what's in my heart that counts."Student Mohammed Gibril 
also wonders about his future in Libya. "I might return home and 
nothing happens; I might return home and something happens," he said.As Libya's 
new leaders struggle to establish order in the country, the students on 
the campus 5,000 miles away are trying to puzzle out their future 
with the help of relatives at home and authorities in the United 
States.The State Department has approved the necessary visas for them to stay 
in the United States, and they intend to continue with their program, 
which will resume next month on the campus of American University in 
Washington, D.C. If they appear to be in danger when it's time 
to return to
 even shoes for young children, he said.Although he said government agencies 
were responding in a quick and efficient manner, they were overwhelmed and 
the United Nations was preparing an appeal for urgent assistance from donors 
and foreign governments.
