 movement, advocating constitutional reform and arguing landmark cases to defend property 
rights and political and religious dissenters. Convicted in 2006 of subversion and 
sentenced to three years, he was quickly released on probation before being 
taken away by security agents in 2009 in the first of his 
forced disappearances that set off an international outcry.The Xinhua report referred to 
his 2006 subversion conviction and said Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court 
found that Gao "had seriously violated probation rules for a number of 
times, which led to the court decision to withdraw the probation."The report 
did not explain what violations Gao had committed but said his five-year 
probation was due to expire next Thursday -- timing which legal experts 
said may have prompted the government to send Gao back to jail. 
"He would serve his term in prison in the next three years," 
the report said.Calls to the No. 1 court and the city's appeals

Nicole Scherzinger (Reuters)MEXICO CITY  Nicole Scherzinger recently was held up at 
gunpoint by a gang in Mexico, RadarOnline reported Thursday.The US "X Factor" 
judge and the show's choreographer, Brian Friedman, were driving in the country 
during a trip to shoot her video "Try with Me" when they 
were pulled over by gunmen, Friedman told Star magazine."We were held at 
gunpoint," he said. "People next to our cars  there were M16s 
and Berettas."HOT SHOTS: Nicole ScherzingerThe 33-year-old former Pussycat Doll and the choreographer 
eventually were released unharmed by the local gang."Nicole cursed me with this 
trip," Friedman added. "It was the craziest adventure ever."

knew something was wrong, then 5 to 10 minutes later that's when 
we hear the police," she said, adding that she and her 20

nervous," she said.The complex has two buildings and her company's office is

Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
 ery driver.In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years in a 
juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in Island County. 
But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and was soon 
back to his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food 
and sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his 
antics escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing 
them -- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media 
as the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the 
actions of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning 
post-traumatic stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote 
Dr. Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense 
lawyers.Waves of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs 
his Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2
ause of "great worry" and said he would urge China once more 
to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be
