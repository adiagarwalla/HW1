<p style="font-size:xx-small;">The Obama administration is ignoring a petition forgery scandal unfolding in South 
Bend, Ind., a former top state elections official  now a U.S. 
congressman -- alleged Sunday, claiming he's still awaiting a response to a 
letter he's written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder about the case.Republican 
Rep. Todd Rokita, who served eight years -- from 2002 to 2010 
-- as Indiana's secretary of state, told Fox News that he has 
not received a response from Holder on either charges of election fraud 
in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in his state or other issues 
of election integrity."We have to involve U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That's 
why I have written a letter to him, he has yet to 
respond to it, about this case. There are federal crimes for interfering 
with a federal election so he has jurisdiction. They are turning their 
heads on this and the ACORN cases that I brought to him," 
Rokita charged.A criminal investigation is now underway by St. Jo
 and what other torture devices to cause the president political discomfort will 
be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as

Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill 
and the tax holiday doesnt expire until Dec. 31. The effort of 
late from the Senate and the White House is to say that 
Speaker John Boehner had secretly agreed to jam through the short Senate 
version and then faced a rebellion from the rank and file  
cue talking points on Tea Party extremists and claims that Boehner has 
lost control.But its been less than a week since Boehner pulled off

 APDecember 1, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio leaves his news 
conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.WASHINGTON  House Republicans will vote down 
a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the 
problem of a negotiating a longer deal into next year."Americans are tired 
of short-term fixes. Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut 
needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a 
bill to do just that," said House Speaker John Boehner.Boehner said the 
House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and 
take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular
