ct here at the first Spacecraft Technology Expo, where thousands of government 
and industry officials have gathered to discuss innovative new technologies and the 
future of human spaceflight.ATK had already been working on a new private 
rocket, called Liberty, which it submitted as a contender in the second 
round of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program last year. Ultimately, the Liberty 
rocket was not selected to receive funding, but ATK continued development of 
the booster under an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA. As part 
of this arrangement, NASA shares its expertise in designing and testing the 
rocket but does not provide money for the project.Now, ATK has unveiled 
plans for a complete launch system centered around the Liberty rocket. The 
design includes a space capsule to carry passengers to destinations in low-Earth 
orbit, such as the International Space Station, said Kent Rominger, vice president 
and program manager for Liberty."The goal is t
o be announced in August. In the meantime, ATK is eager to 
continue development of the Liberty system."For us as a nation, we need 
commercial crew and heavy lift to maintain our leadership in space," Rominger 
said. "To me, it looks like this is a team that we, 
as a nation, should be very comfortable with. Let's do this so 
we can get U.S. astronauts launching from the U.S. by 2015."Sign up

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
 , area, told The Associated Press they spoke for about 15 minutes. 
"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting 
body langu
 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde
