WASHINGTON  The House has passed a $1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill 
paying for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments and averting a government 
shutdown, while Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut and jobless 
benefits reached a critical phase.The 296-121 vote to approve the spending measure 
represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in a polarized Capitol. The Senate's 
top Republican, meanwhile, raised the stakes in the showdown over the payroll 
tax cut, insisting he won't back a compromise extension unless the bill 
includes language aimed at forcing construction of a Canada-to-Texas pipeline.As negotiations on 
the payroll tax bill proceeded Friday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
said, "I will not be able to support the package that doesn't 
include the pipeline."The GOP's pipeline demands added uncertainty to efforts by McConnell 
and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to quickly reach a deal 
on a bill renewing payroll tax 
 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
n authorities because of a number of problems.These include concerns over who 
the money should be released to in Libya and whether it will 
be used for humanitarian purposes as required in some cases, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The

  that hit China every year.Around Wukan village and in much of 
the rest of Guangdong province, conflicts have been intense because the area 
is among China's most economically developed, pushing up land prices.
ther executives charged were Fannie's Enrico Dallavecchia, 50, a former chief risk 
officer, and Thomas Lund, 53, a former executive vice president; and Freddie's 
Patricia Cook, 58, a former executive vice president and chief business officer, 
and Donald Bisenius, 53, a former senior vice president.Lund's lawyer, Thomas Levy, 
said in a statement that Lund "did not mislead anyone." Lawyers for 
the other defendants declined to comment Friday morning.
