work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
e U.S. Supreme Court."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation
