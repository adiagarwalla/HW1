 who is now married to a younger woman  showed his 
childish side following an interview with Australian TV program Sunrise after they 
played clips of his ex-wife commenting about him on her show. He 
exploded backstage, hurling profanities at the entertainment producer and calling him such 
things as a sick dog. Grammer has since been banned from ever 
appearing again on the popular morning show.#5. Ashton KutcherKutcher headlines when it 
was reported he cheated on his soon-to-be former wife Demi Moore with 
a 22-year-old San Diego blonde named Sara Leal  on the weekend 
of his sixth wedding anniversary. Kutcher then shot his reputation a little 
further last month by hastily tweeting his anger that Joe Paterno had 
been fired from his position as the Penn State football coach, without 
fully understanding the grave nature behind Paternos dismissal. Oops.#4. Kim KardashianAs one

appears to be an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report on drone 
warfare, posted on a website, found that communications links are a "primary

"Small, simple GPS  jammers can be easily constructed and employed by 
an unsophisticated adversary and would be effective over a limited RPA (remotely 
piloted aircraft) operating area," the report said.The website, Public Intelligence, describes itself 
as an international consortium of independent researchers dedicated to providing access open-source 
intelligence materials. Some independent U.S. experts confirmed that the document accurately describes 
a well-known potential vulnerability in drones.But Ted Beneigh, an expert on unmanned

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down

North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">presidential race for 2012, Rokita warned that officials need to safeguard the 
integrity of the country's electoral process."You really need honest people in both 
parties looking after this process, this process only works when people are 
civically engaged, including party members and party workers who are paid, in 
this case, by the county to make sure the signatures are checked."He 
also suggested that photo ID "would be the stopgap that catches some 
of these things, like ACORN in 2008, when they were filing fraudulent 
voter registrations."Although photo ID, a controversial measure in other states, may not 
have been applicable to petition signatures, the Democratic chairman of St. Joseph 
County has proposed measures intended to prevent any wrong doing in the 
collection of signatures that is underway now.State Sen. John Broden has suggested 
instituting random audits of signatures, a system of verifying their authenticity and 
keeping track of who collected signatu
  people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
ling with North Korea over the past three years, since Pyongyang pulled 
out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal
