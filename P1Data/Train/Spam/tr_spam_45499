nt moderate who would get marginalized in the general election. This time, 
Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more 
fire, but the message is the same: Stop this charging RINO.So, while 
Romney can count on some of the same Florida supporters who backed 
his 2008 bid, particularly Northeastern transplants and businessmen looking for someone to 
be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If 
Romneys week of blistering high-dollar, high-frequency attacks on Gingrichs character have hurt 
enough, conservatives unable to vote for the more moderate former Massachusetts governor 
but anxious 
oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami 
Herald/Tampa Bay Times pol
 score for early Sunday had been forecast to be a 6 
in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.

was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of

Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the

17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
