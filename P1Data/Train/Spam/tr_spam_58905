o has served as the Derry GOP chairman for seven years.Robo-calls are 
a sensitive issue in New Hampshire, which is inundated with political messages 
every four years.Foley was among the New Hampshire Republicans who encouraged state 
prosecutors to go after the state Democratic Party for a separate robo-call 
incident last year. The party agreed to settle the matter this summer 
with a $5,000 fine."You'd like campaigns to observe the law, and the 
law is that you can't do robo-calls to the do-not-call list," Sytek 
said. "It's not the end of the world, but it just shows 
they seem to be making it up as they go along."The state 
attorney general's office confirmed receipt of the complaints and said they were 
being reviewed.
the report investigating allegations of abuse dating back to 1945.The commission received 
some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.

sophisticated jamming equipment it means a lot else is at risk too."Of 
course, given the secretive nature of the mission and the RQ-170 drone 
itself, the truth may never emerge -- and may even be something 
purely mundane."It's entirely possible the aircraft ran out of gas and malfunctioned

 o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

the country for trial, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said."We have sought 
and received assurances that he will be tried for his crimes," Vietor 
said Friday.It was not immediately clear what charges he could face. The 
U.S. has said he was part of a brazen raid in which 
four American soldiers were abducted and killed in the Iraqi holy city 
of Karbala in 2007.Iraq has had a shoddy record on detainee security. 
Last year, just a week after the U.S. turned more than 1,000 
detainees at its Camp Cropper prison over to Iraqi control, four al-Qaida-linked 
detainees escaped. An investigation showed that the detainees had inside help.That had 
lawmakers worried that Daqduq would return to Hezbollah soon after his transfer. 
Shortly before the White House announcement, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was gathering 
signatures on a letter to Obama."Daqduq's Iranian paymasters would like nothing more
