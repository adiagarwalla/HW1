December 17, 2011: This surveillance photo provided by the New York (City) 
Police Dept. shows a suspect wanted in connection with a homicide, in 
the Brooklyn borough of New York. A New York City man was 
arrested and charged with murder after allegedly burning an elderly woman to 
death inside her apartment building elevator over $2,000 he claims she owed 
him.Authorities said that when 73-year-old Deloris Gillespie went up the elevator to 
her fifth-floor Brooklyn apartment on Saturday, carrying groceries, suspect Jerome Isaac was 
waiting.Surveillance video from inside the small elevator shows 47-year-old Isaac looked something 
like an exterminator, with a canister sprayer, white gloves and a dust 
mask, which was perched atop his head like a pair of sunglasses. 
The sprayer was full of flammable liquid.When the elevator opened Saturday afternoon, 
the suspect sprayed the woman, who turned around and crouched down to 
try to protect herself, New York Police Department

 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
