This is one of the touristic places and it??s ok. 18648543 We went with one of the hop on/off buses (The Big Bus Company) as it was one of its stops. The guide told us it was better in summer, with live performances and that kind of things. Today we found a lovely market with a lot of food and crafty stands. It took us two hours (including lunch) to visit it. If you are a food lover, this can be your place!  We also went to the Children??s Market and this was somehow disappointing. There??s not much to do or buy, the place is loud and not very good looking.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Granville Island Public Market is an indoor public market place where you find artisans, coffee shops, bakeries, 18648543 produce, and other goods.  It's a great place to go to grocery shop, but unique goods, and do some sight-seeing.

My Overall Rating - 4  1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Facility, Return)

Atmosphere - Only a few kilometers 18648543 from downtown Vancouver, the Marketplace can be found underneath the highway on the island.  There is public parking, and the island setting allows for some scenic views of Vancouver.  On weekends parking can be tough, but it's nothing compared to going inside.  But it's got that public market feel, and it's great.  1 Star.

Service - This really varies between vendors 5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7 and how crowded things are.  Luckily all the folks we dealt with were friendly and efficient.  They'll let you gawk at their wares as you examine the market.  I can't guarantee everyone will be great, but we had no issues.  1 Star.

Facility - Here you can find fresh produce 18648543 across from a cheese vendor.  It really is an awesome sight to behold.  It reminds me of Pike Market in Seattle, the Public Market in New Orleans, or the Ferry Building in San Francisco.  There are two small food courts, plenty of bakers/patisseries, cheese vendors, artists, produce, etc.  You can get so many fresh items here and enjoy an amazing view as well.  Expect large crowd on weekends.  It can get VERY busy and it makes walking down the narrow walkways difficult, and public tables on scarce during lunch/dinner times.  Like most busy markets, this is probably the main drawback.  1  1/2 Stars.

Will I Return? - Yes.  It's a no brainer stop 18648543 when you visit Vancouver.  It's best to go in with no shopping list and let your senses take over.  You'll find they may lead you on a unique culinary adventure.  1 Star.

My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):
1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.
1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7
