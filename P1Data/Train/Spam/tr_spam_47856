, the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha

those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered 
apartment where he used to live in the St. Clair Shores suburb 
of Detroit described him as "big and angry.""He broke into the apartment 
above me twice," former neighbor Glenda Southerland told the station."He was squatting 
here threatening my life," added the apartment's manager, Kellie Roddy.Bob Bashara's sister, 
meanwhile, insisted Sunday that he is "an innocent man" and "incapable of 
this horrific act."Newscore contributed to this report.Click for more on this story

large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent

 Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said.
