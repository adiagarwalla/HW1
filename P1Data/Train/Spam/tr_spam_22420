would help build support on Capitol Hill and address critics who ask 
why the government is helping people who borrowed more than they could 
afford.Click here to read more from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).
 While President Obama will deliver another speech on the economy Wednesday in 
Northern Virginia to keep the focus on jobs, Catholic leaders across the 
country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come 
November.Catholics are fired up over new rules implementing Obama's health care reform 
law forcing Catholic universities, hospitals, and charities to provide insurance for their 
employees covering contraception -- even though that violates church teachings."When you push 
people of faith and you tell them the government is going to 
knock down the wall of separation of church and state and overreach 
like the Obama administration, you've got a war on your hands," Bill 
Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News.In an extraordinary move 
this past weekend, New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan and other archbishops throughout 
the nation had their priests read letters denouncing the Obama administration policy 
from the pulpit at Sunday Mass
 a longtime aide.Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest 
in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as 
auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium 
on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control 
and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, 
when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called 
homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested gays were more likely 
to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out 
gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be 
an active homosexual   a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare.He 
was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call 
for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> expulsion of foreign invaders from Afghanistan," the document continued.The report added, 
however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much

 Korea has repeatedly pressed for the resumption of those nuclear talks, but 
Washington and Seoul have said Pyongyang must first follow through on previous 
nuclear commitments.Campbell urged China, North Korea's only major economic and political backer, 
to share more of its plans concerning North Korea with Washington and 
Seoul.Japan's Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported this week that China 
decided to provide 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of oil 
to North Korea in a move meant to help stabilize Kim Jong 
Un's leadership.Campbell said the United States believes Chinese officials have "taken steps 
to underscore their commitment to the transition in power in North Korea. 
Those steps might include further provision of assistance, given the circumstances in 
North Korea." He didn't elaborate.North Korea regularly criticizes South Korean President Lee 
Myung-bak and says it won't work with him. South Korea has cut 
off large-scale offici
a long time," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday on 
Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy
