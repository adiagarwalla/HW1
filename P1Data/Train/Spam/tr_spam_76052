il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be 
nizant of this."
eriod to discuss their concerns."Even some Catholic Democrats are not buying that 
claim, however, with liberal columnist E.J. Dionne ripping the policy in a 
Washington Post column. Dionne charged Monday that the president "utterly botched" the 
issue and "threw his progressive Catholic allies under the bus."A report last 
year from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization, found 
that 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used birth control 
despite the church's teachings. According to a Reuters report on the study, 
only 2 percent of Catholic women rely on natural family planning.Nevertheless, the 
bishops have noted in their lobbying campaign that contraceptive coverage would include 
the so-called "morning after pill," opening the door to even more controversy 
over abortion.Carney noted the administration still offers "strong support for existing conscience 
protections, including those relating to health care providers" an

making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
 U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.
ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
