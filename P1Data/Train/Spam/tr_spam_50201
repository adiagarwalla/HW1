Nov. 14: Director Clint Eastwood (R) and his wife Dina Ruiz Eastwood 
arrive at the Museum of Tolerance International Film Festival gala awards presentation 
in his honor in Los Angeles. (Reuters)Is Clint Eastwood going the way 
of the Kardashians? Apparently so, as his wife and two of his 
daughters are currently shooting a family reality show intended to air on 
the E! network, TMZ has learned.Sources connected to the production tell TMZ 
that the show will explore what it's like to live in a 
family of "Hollywood royalty."It will focus on the relationship between Clint's wife 
Dina Eastwood, their daughter Morgan and Clint's 18-year-old daughter Francesca, an aspiring 
actress.Were told 81-year-old Clint has agreed to make a couple of cameos 
-- but will not be a main character on the show.The show 
is being produced by reality powerhouse Bunim/Murray -- the same people who 
produce all of the Kardashian reality shows, along with "The Real World" 
and "Bad Girls Club."S
e president mugs for cameras with the troops the message is clear: 
there is only one commander in chief. And Obama, who came to 
office with a thin resume on foreign affairs, has been getting on-the-job 
training in the subject for three years.And polls do show Obama outperforming 
his job approval numbers when it comes to foreign affairs, especially on 
terrorism. In the latest FOX News poll, Obama carded a weak 44 
percent overall job approval rating and a dire 35 percent on his 
handling of the economy. But Obama got 50 percent for his handling 
of Iraq and 47 percent on handling of Afghanistan.And what weaknesses Obama 
has shown on foreign policy have been within the Democratic base with 
voters unhappy about Obamas extension of several key points of Bush administration 
policy and the escalation of the Afghan war. Those dont sound like 
potential GOP voters, though they could punish Obama by sitting on the 
sidelines.The Republican contenders, meanwhile, dont offer 
omestic box-office record of $10.6 billion set in 2009, a mark that 
was nearly reached again in 2010.But with less than two weeks left 
and revenues lagging 4 percent behind last year's, that record is out 
of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> information on whether he had an attorney.Residents were evacuated and kept 
away from the six-story building for hours Saturday night as police investigated. 
On Sunday, Holguin said, the fifth floor was a mess, with a 
melted elevator door and a layer of water on the floor.Holguin said 
he and his girlfriend had taken the elevator on their way out 
of the building shortly before the attack. They didn't see anyone on 
the floor with them but did notice an odd smell, as if 
someone was painting, he said.Holguin said police told them later that the 
assailant was already in the building and perhaps had hidden on another 
floor when they left their apartment.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

 from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
PYONGYANG, North Korea  The man named the "great successor" to take 
control of North Korea in the wake of the death of Kim 
Jong Il, is a baby-faced twenty-something with virtually no public profile outside 
of his home country.Kim Jong Un, known only to be in his 
late 20s, has gained the little profile he has over the past 
three years -- as he has slowly been pushed forward as the 
man to take over from his ailing father.On Monday, that transition was 
seemingly complete, with North Korean state media reporting that the younger Kim, 
born to the late leader's third wife, was the "great successor" to 
his father."Standing in the van of the Korean revolution at present is 
Kim Jong Un, great successor to the revolutionary cause of juche and 
outstanding leader of our party, army and people," the country's official news 
agency said, referring to the official ideology of juche or self-reliance, AFP 
reported."Kim Jong Un's leadership provides a sure guarantee for creditab
