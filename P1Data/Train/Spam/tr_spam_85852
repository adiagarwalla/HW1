In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states

Romney among seniors and Hispanics. Half of the seniors polled were supporting 
Romney, while 35 percent backed Gingrich. Romney also led Gingrich 56-29 percent 
among Hispanic voters, the largest minority in the state, exit polling showed.Voters 
overwhelmingly went for Romney among those who said winning in November is 
the most important quality in a Republican nominee. But for voters who 
valued "true conservative" credentials as their top quality, Gingrich led with 46 
percent, followed by Santorum at 26 percent and Paul at 16 percent. 
Among those voters, Romney was last with 11 percent.
