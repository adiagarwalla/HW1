 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

s questioned two wealthy supporters, Fred and Lisa Blue Baron, on why 
they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your 
enemies closer," P
c partnership benefits, such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth 
... but my view is that marriage itself is between a man 
and a woman, and that's my own preference."The Republican Party also reiterated 
its opposition to gay marriage after Obama's statement."While President Obama has played 
politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt 
Romney have been clear. We support maintaining marriage between one man and 
one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that," Republican National 
Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said.Obama said Wednesday that he's tried to stay 
"sensitive" to the fact that for many people "the word marriage was 
something that evokes a very powerful tradition."He also reportedly said he still 
thinks states should be able to decide the issue.Obama actually expressed support 
for same-sex marriages during a 1996 race for Illinois state Senate. He 
later backed off that support, stating during th

have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

 MONTREAL  Police say smoke bombs were set off at multiple points 
in Montreal's subway system, briefly cutting off service and creating a nightmarish 
morning commute.Quebec Premier Jean Charest condemned the attack, saying he hopes the 
guilty parties are found.The incident occurred near the peak of Thursday morning

service has been interrupted in recent weeks as the city deals with 
student protests over tuition increases.Thursday's subway shutdown caused long lineups at bus 
stops and increased traffic under a heavy drizzle.Sign up for free e-mail

President Barack Obama has threatened to veto a Department of Justice appropriations 
bill House Republicans passed because, among other things, it includes a provision 
that blocks a gun control law his administration used Operation Fast and 
Furious to pass.The Obama administrations Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
wrote, and began implementing, a new rule that would require gun dealers 
in the four U.S. states that border Mexico to report sales of 
multiple semi-automatic rifles to the ATF.In the 2013 fiscal year budget for 
the Department of Justice and related agencies, House Republicans inserted a rider, 
or condition, that would force the ATF to not implement that rule.In 
a statement the White House released upon receiving the House appropriations bill, 
the administration threatened it would veto the legislation because of that ATF 
rider, among other things.In the statement, the White House called that rider
