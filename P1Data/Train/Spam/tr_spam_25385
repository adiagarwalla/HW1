r more information. But the competition had plenty to say.Facebook mobile apps: 
Bad on purpose?Anderson argued that Windows RT -- a version of Windows 
rewritten from the ground up to support the ARM processors powering nearly 
every tablet and smartphone today -- prohibits any browser but Internet Explorer 
from running the classic Windows desktop.This means that only Internet Explorer will 
be able to perform many of the advanced computing functions vital to 
modern browsers in terms of speed, stability, and security to which users 
have grown accustomed.Given that IE can run in Windows on ARM, there 
is no technical reason to conclude other browsers cant do the same, 
Anderson wrote.His words were emphatically echoed by Google, maker of the Chrome 
browser.We share the concerns Mozilla has raised regarding the Windows 8 environment 
restricting user choice and innovation, a Google spokeswoman told FoxNews.com.We've always welcomed 
innovation in the browser space acros

was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions

CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
