Dear Subscriber,

Prepare yourself: there is a new-scandal that is just about to break.

This scandal is regarding what we have found to be a HUGE conspiracy between our government many of the biggest food-producers in the U.S.

This alarming-story is so controversial that Fox-News banned it from being aired, and then fired the 2 reporters who were trying to air it.

If you are happy with our president, you shouldn't bother watching this presentation.

This is so shocking that many people are going to want to IMPEACH Obama for what he's been doing...This may be the thing that finally takes him down.

I must warn you though, what you are going to find out might seriously turn your stomach.


Sincerely,
Doug Hill

14448930 restaurant. But some of us were still hungry after 14448930 meal -- we could do with more filler food. OK, I am a sucker for Queso Fundido, so my dining experience was off to an incredible start. 14448930 fundido was hot, but not scathing and had a great consistency. Then 14448930 blue corn tortilla with duck. 14448930 duck just melted.   I ordered dinner, not thinking about how full I would be from 14448930 appetizers, but I powered through. I ordered 14448930 16 spice chicken. Just 14448930 right blend of spices (no I don't know what they were), 14448930 right amount of spicy, and 14448930 chicken was cooked perfectly. So I was to full to have dessert. y only complaint is that 14448930 staff stood around a lot, in full view. Which is really frustrating if you are waiting on something. As an added bonus
