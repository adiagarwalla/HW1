s excoriated by black leaders as well as Assemblyman Reed Gusciora, a 
white, openly gay Democrat.Newark Mayor Cory Booker said baseball great Jackie Robinson 
would not have had the opportunity to break the sport's color barrier 
had the matter been put to a vote, and the mayor himself 
would not have had the opportunity, years later, to be elected to 
lead New Jersey's largest city. Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said many felt 
the sting of Christie's comment.Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a titan in the 
civil rights movement, also came to Trenton on Monday to pound the 
governor."I've said over the years that I fought too long and too 
hard against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up 
and speak out against discrimination based on sexual orientation," Lewis said.But Christie, 
who blasted critics for suggesting that he misunderstood history enough to suggest 
that the civil rights movement of 50 years ago could have been 
put to a referendum in Alabama, s
the outstanding issues," Nackaerts told reporters. "And the Iranians said the are 
committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
United States and its allies.The IAEA team was seeking progress on its 
efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The 
United States and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which 
they worry could e
nizant of this."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">PARACHINAR, Pakistan  Government officials say Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant positions 
in two different areas along the Afghan border, killing 31 suspected insurgents.Political 
administrators Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul say the strikes occurred Wednesday morning 
in the Orakzai and Kurram tribal areas.It was not possible to independently 
confirm the information because the areas are effectively off-limits to reporters.The strikes 
followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram 
that killed over 60 people in the last week.The Pakistani military has 
launched a series of offensives against militants in the country's semiautonomous tribal 
region in the past few years.

total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of
