volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said."Twitter is 
growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail 
Patel, who follows digital media in the region for the research firm 
Informa Telecoms &amp; Media. "The Middle East is an important region for 
Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all Middle East residents 
... because of the Arab Spring protests."Alwaleed is launching a new Arabic 
news channel that will challenge established players such as Qatar's Al-Jazeera and 
Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin 
operations next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg 
LP. Alwaleed has said he hopes the new network will focus on 
the shifts taking place across the Arab world, with an emphasis on

being investigated because of allegations made "by an adolescent male," the organization 
separated him from "all of our program activities involving children." The Second 
Mile statement makes no mention of the sexual nature of the 2008 
complaint.He said in the interview last week some staff at The Second 
Mile were informed in 2008 that the complaint was the reason Sandusky 
was not participating in programs serving children, but only on an "as-needed 
basis."Bonnie Marshall, the charity's vice president for development, said Raykovitz described the 
2008 complaint to her and other senior staff as a general abuse 
complaint, not one of a sexual nature.She said Raykovitz explained that Sandusky 
would be taking a break from programs with children but would continue 
fundraising.She said she also was unaware of Genovese's conversation with Rosamilia, and
