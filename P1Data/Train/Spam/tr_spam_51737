Dear Beneficiary,</DIV>
<DIV>
My name is PETER ADDISON the prize director representing the UK Bond Security Company Claims Department. Further to our letter dated November 22nd 2014 in which you were informed of your selection as the prize winner of our quarterly Two Million Dollars (US$ 2,000,000.00) award, we are yet to receive any response from you. Every year we enter 50,000 names from different sweepstakes and lottery databases worldwide, and our network server indicates that you were selected as a prize winner on Nov 30th 2014 and you still have not claimed your winnings for the sum of Two Million Dollars (US$ 2,000,000.00) Now we are required to notify you that if we do not hear from you within 3 weeks from the date of this letter, your file will be closed and you will no longer be able to claim your winnings. Usually when a winner does not claim their money, there should be a note stating why before we can legally close their file.</DIV>
<DIV>
 </DIV>
<DIV>
To elaborate further, this draw was held in London, where our head office is located.&nbsp; Your lucky numbers 5-10-15-24-31-45 won in the 2nd category.&nbsp; You have therefore been approved for a lump sum pay out of Two Million Dollars (US$ 2,000,000.00) at no extra cost. This is a free claim for beneficiaries from our member countries.</DIV>
<DIV>
Now, we would like to explain to you the Federal and International regulations governing the personal collections of cash prizes.</DIV>
<DIV>
Prize winnings are released to you as soon as your Clearance Fee is paid. That will be the day that your cheque will be released from our remittance office. Your clearance fee is a calculated amount based on the size of your winning as required by Federal and International regulations.&nbsp; Note that once your clearance fee is paid, you will receive your winnings in the form of a certified cheque or if you request, by Bank transfer directly into your bank account or any account nominated by you.</DIV>
<DIV>
For security purpose and clarity, we strongly advise that you keep your winning information confidential until your claims have been fully processed and your money remitted to you. This is part of our security protocol to avoid double claims and unwarranted abuse of this program by some nominees. So once again, Congratulations to you!&nbsp; For more information please contact our main processing office in London, UK. Phone: + 44-703-190-5334</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
Sincerely Yours,</DIV>
<DIV>
