<br><hr><br>
If you're thinking of taking a cruise and traveling solo, you probably
already know that cruise lines charge an extra fee for an individual
booking a cabin intended for two. Typically, the cruise line starts with
the per-person rate based on double occupancy and adds 50the price for a single traveler -- the dreaded single supplement.<br>
<br>
The good news? Vacations To Go has found or negotiated low or no single
supplements on hundreds of prime cruise departures. These great solo
deals are updated daily and listed on our site.
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emailtick.cfm?r=0&jpw=107&nr=cus_F9b">Click here</a>
to see our <b>Singles Discounts</b> ticker now.<br>
<br><hr><br>
Cruise lines have been working for years to accommodate passengers with
disabilities, and 115 of the world's best cruise ships are now
accessible to some extent.<br>
<br>
Eight years ago, Vacations To Go filled a void in the travel industry
with the creation of a department dedicated to assisting travelers with
disabilities. We developed the first comprehensive, ship-by-ship guide
to facilities, services and amenities for travelers with special needs,
with search tools that not only reveal the ships that meet these needs
but return great bargains as well.<br>
<br>
There are ships with TTY phones and vibrating alarm clocks for guests
who are hard of hearing or deaf; menus and daily activity lists in large
print for people who have low vision; roll-in showers, push-button doors
and pool access for travelers who use wheelchairs or scooters; and many
other features to make cruising accessible. There are services that will
deliver oxygen tanks or wheelchairs or scooters to a ship on the day of
departure, and retrieve them at the end of a cruise.<br>
<br>
For more information,
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emaillink.cfm?lnk=spneeds&nr=cus_F9b">click here</a>
to visit the section of our site devoted to travelers with special
needs.<br>
<br>
Our Special Needs department is open Monday-Friday from 7 a.m. to 7
p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Central Standard
Time. Be sure to tell your cruise counselor about all your special needs
prior to booking so that he or she can determine if they can be met.<br>
