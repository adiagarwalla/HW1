We were seated at the sushi bar area which I love 9288061 watching the orders be made and occasionally bother the chefs for recommendations. We ordered the Cod, salmon sashimi plate, toro roll, and fresh others. Everything was delish! And writing about it makes me want to plan another trip back. The stand outs were definitely the cod and fresh oysters. The shooters were seasoned this sweet and salty sauce that kept me wanting for more. I would say, the best seasoning I've ever had on a fresh oyster. As for the cod, it was buttery, well glazed and so filling. I love it when restaurants cook fish right and it is one of them.d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec

I'm so glad I came on "easy" day around 7pm on a weekday (it got fairly busy at 8pm). We got seats for 2 after 10-15 minutes or so. This place is pretty small but I'm actually really happy about this! 9288061 That's how you know this place is legit. There's much more quality control if a Japanese restaurant is small. We sat at the bar area with the sushi chefs in front of us. Dang, they were busy bees! The table was surprisingly roomy for bar seats and there was enough space to fit many plates of sashimi heh.

Absolutely NO HYPE HERE. Hands down amazingly fresh sashimi. I was worried that for 2, just a sashimi platter (12 pieces) 9288061 wouldn't be filling enough so we also ordered a lobster don as well. The 12 pieces included Atlantic salmon, Yellowtail(?), Octopus (Tako) and Tuna. The sashimi didn't have that gross smelly fishiness at all. I was surprised by that since that smell always kept me away from sashimi. WOW it tasted so good. Every single piece had a distinct texture and taste. I loved that feeling of swallowing it and passing my throat muscles, the sashimi was brilliantly smooth and silky. MY TASTE BUDS AND MOUTH WERE PLEASED.

The lobster on top of the lobster 9288061 don was pretty generous and fresh! You can tell immediately that it wasn't imitation and that they spent a bit of time cracking those shells for the delicious goodness. The strands of tamago (egg) were cut to perfection. They were SUPER thin slices that accompanied the lobster strands in a subtle but gorgeous manner. The beads of rice were chewy and complimented the lobster well. I only really wish there wasn't THAT much rice so the ratio between lobster meat and rice evened.

After that, we weren't full, so we ordered 2 pieces each of Sockeye salmon and Toro (fatty tuna). I preferred the chewy thick texture of Atlantic more than Sockeye but I thoroughly enjoyed the mushy texture of the Sockeye. The toro was fabulous! It was the most fattiest goodness, most epic of "melt-in-mouth" textures ever! Absolutely amazing and I'm speechless.d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec
