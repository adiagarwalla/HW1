DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
."Never before has the government forced individuals and organizations to go out 
into the marketplace and buy a product that violates their conscience," Dolan 
said in a web video that takes the battle online. "This shouldn't 
happen in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in 
the Bill of Rights. How about letting our elected leaders know that 
we want religious liberty and rights of consciences restored and the administration's 
mandate rescinded? We can't afford to strike out on this one."Pressed on 
the matter at his daily briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney repeated several times the administration believes it struck an "appropriate balance" 
in crafting the policy."The administration believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate 
balance between respecting religious beliefs and increasing access to important preventive services," 
said Carney. "We will continue to work closely with religious groups during 
this transitional p
ssance capabilities.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
 y night after she failed to return home.The woman's coworkers reportedly said 
she was last seen Tuesday after a meeting at Detroit Edison's downtown 
headquarters.According to WJBK-TV, Gentz walked into the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department 
at about 4:30 a.m. local time Tuesday and told officers that the 
woman was murdered in her garage and that he helped dispose of 
her body.Police can hold Gentz for up to 72 hours without arresting 
him. A Wayne County prosecutor said Tuesday that no warrants were submitted 
for any arrests in the case.Bob Bashara failed a polygraph test administered 
Friday night, police said. The father of two hired well-known defense attorney 
David Griem, who spoke to reporters after Jane Bashara's funeral Tuesday morning.He 
described Gentz as "very questionable" and added that Bob Bashara identified Gentz 
as someone who may have had it in for the family -- 
and put him on a list of people that police should look 
at.Gentz' neighbors at the 
APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
