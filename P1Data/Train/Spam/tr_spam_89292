or has been notoriously erratic, making predictions about its intentions difficult. However, 
they said they believed there would not be significant changes in North 
Korean policies under Kim's son and heir apparent Kim Jong Un until 
at least after the mourning period ends.Kim's death came as the Obama 
administration was debating whether to go ahead with a new round of 
nuclear disarmament talks with the North and whether to provide food aid 
to the country, which has been struggling with crippling food shortages.The administration 
had been poised to announce a significant donation of food aid to 
North Korea this week, the first concrete accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes 
diplomatic contacts between the two wartime enemies, according to sources close to 
the negotiations. And, an agreement by North Korea to suspend its controversial 
uranium enrichment program was expected to follow within days, the sources said.Suspension 
of uranium enrichment by North
r the Cold War-era armed conflict ended in a cease-fire.Japanese Prime Minister 
Yoshihiko Noda held an emergency national security council with top Cabinet members 
soon after hearing the news.He "instructed us to be best prepared in 
case of any unexpected development" while top officials meet to discuss the 
situation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told journalists in Tokyo.Fujimura expressed condolences 
and said Japan hoped Kim's death would not affect the region adversely."First 
of all we hope that this sudden development would not give adverse 
impact on the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula," he said.The 
White House said it was in constant contact with South Korea and 
Japan, but offered no substantive comment on the implications of Kim's death, 
saying only that President Barack Obama "reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment 
to the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our 
close ally, the Republic of Korea."The news jo
o continue even after they became fully aware of it."Raykovitz also is 
facing questions about his handling of the 2008 complaint.Rosamilia, the Clinton County 
youth services chief, said he had informed Raykovitz's wife in November 2008 
that his office was terminating its relationship with The Second Mile because 
of an abuse complaint. He said he had not identified the target 
of that complaint, but that Genovese eventually guessed correctly that it was 
Sandusky.Rosamilia, who said he mentioned his conversation with Genovese to investigators working 
on the current prosecution, also recalled Genovese saying that a member of 
The Second Mile board planned to speak with Sandusky about staying away 
from Second Mile events involving children.Raykovitz said Rosamilia's description of the conversation 
with his wife is incorrect. He would not elaborate. Attempts to reach 
Genovese were unsuccessful.Raykovitz referred questions about what he did in 2008 to 
a prior statement,

their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in

APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and
