		 and I both had Tiger Shrimp Tamales as appetizers, based on Michael Symon's "Best Thing I Ever Ate in Vegas".  They lived up to 21369209 hype.  I really enjoyed 21369209 Pork Tenderloin Sandwich... but not nearly as much as my son loved 21369209 Smoked Shrimp Tacos.  He wasn't as excited about coming to Mesa Grill in 21369209 first place, but he raved about these.  So,  yes, this is a pricey place... but it was absolutely worth it for us.  21369209 service could not have been better. Amazing, amazing, amazing! Every single aspect of this dining experience was stellar. Mesa Grill was on my radar before arriving in LV so my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30P on a Friday evening. I'm sure there's SOME room for walk-ins, but I would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. Bobby Flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. We started out with 21369209 roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off 21369209 meal perfectly. All 21369209 flavors in 21369209 dish just worked together perfectly. We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on 21369209 roasted corn and 21369209 cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. 21369209 corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. 21369209 chile was great, though didn't quite have 21369209 same impact. Being a pescetarian, 21369209 tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. By 21369209 end of 21369209 meal I was at 21369209 point where I was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was SO good! Dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. When you pop in keep in mind that 21369209 portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. All around amazing. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas! I have to say that when someone gets a little "too much" fame like Bobby Flay, I'm extra critical when it comes to anything associated with them.  I know it's not fair, but when there's a lot of hype, there's also a lot of hope that there's an amazing experience to back it all up! I went into Mesa Grill with ridiculously high expectations (hello Iron Chef!) and WOW.. I didn't think they could be exceeded, but 21369209 food was a total oralgasm.  21369209 skilled craftsmanship of bold flavors balanced against subtle undertones and
