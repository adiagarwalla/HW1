 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
d his party's leaders have fallen short in their duty to tackle 
our generation's most pressing fiscal and economic challenges.""We will not solve this 
problem unless both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are willing to move off 
their fixed positions and find common ground," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Kent Conrad, a Democrat. "Republicans must be willing to put revenue on 
the table."The study also predicts modest economic growth of 2 percent this 
year and forecasts that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent 
this year and next. That is based on an assumption that President 
Barack Obama will fail to win renewal of payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits by the end of next month.That jobless rate is higher 
than the rates that contributed to losses by Presidents Jimmy Carter (7.5 
percent) and George H.W. Bush (7.4 percent). The study predicts unemployment to 
remain above roughly 5 percent -- until 2016. The agency also predicts

vice president for policy, external affairs and communications at Pfizer Inc., a 
job that includes directing the pharmaceutical giant's government relations operations.California figured most 
prominently on Obama's roster of big money "bundlers." Sixteen are from California 
and 13 are from New York.Top fundraisers include movie producers Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and Harvey Weinstein, and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Actress Eva Longoria was 
in the second highest tier, bundling $200,000 to $500,000 for Obama's re-election.

 ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said. 
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
