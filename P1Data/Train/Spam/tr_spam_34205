<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">The first time reviewing Murphy's I reviewed strictly brunch. I came here for dinner for my birthday, which called for a updated review.  23214367 I made a reservation using Opentable, which only allowed for a maximum of 8 people. I commented on the available comment section asking for 9, which they allowed without making a fuss. 

We walked in right at 7:30 on a rainy day. 23214367 There is complimentary valet parking, but we decided to park a little down the street to avoid the fee.We were seated in a crowded dark corner, but we didn't mind, as long as we could all be seated together. The seats on the outside of the table seemed to leak into the walkway, which made for some uncomfortable shifting when servers or other restaurant patrons tried to pass.The server brought out complimentary bread shortly after we made our order. She poured us olive oil to dip it in, which we could add freshly ground pepper and salt to. The bread crust was a little drier than I would have hoped, but our hungry stomachs didn't complain as we asked for a refill.

I ordered the Guinness braised beef brisket, 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb which sounded mighty tasty. After tasting my friend's flash fried calamari - she claimed it was the best calamari she has ever had, and I have to agree, it was quite good, I tasted another friend's fries, which came with her burger.

I am quoting her words, that they tasted 23214367 like McDonalds fries but with fresh potatoes (and that's a compliment, by the way). I was highly anticipating the taste of my brisket at this point. The brisket was a little dry, while I would have hoped for some melt in your mouth, tender meat. The flavors, however, were quite good, with the peculiar taste of the horseradish mashed potatoes and the sweetness of the roasted carrots. I was slightly disappointed, but I cannot complain. There was barely a drop of truffle flavoring in the macaroni, and it became drier and drier as it continued to bake in the hot cast iron ramekin. Truffle oil always overwhelms a dish, which in this case it thankfully did not. However, I also could barely taste any trace of truffle.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb
