 URGENT: Read This Before You Take Another E-ZPass Lane<br>
 <br>
 Dear warrenjaneant@fs.net,
 </div>
 <div>
 Last week, something crazy happened.
 </div>
 <div>
 I met with a CIA insider at a corner office in New York City.
 </div>
 <div>
 He began talking about a secret plan... one that could undermine America&#3=
9;s financial system.
 </div>
 <div>
 A plan that&#39;s set to radically change the future of our nation.
 </div>
 <div>
 If this wasn&#39;t coming from a guy who has worked with the CIA, the Penta=
gon and 14 other intelligence agencies, I wouldn&#39;t have believed.
 </div>
 <div>
 After this plan comes into effect, our country will look a lot different th=
an it looks today.
 </div>
 <div>
 For example, you won&#39;t believe how the government might end up using E-=
ZPass lanes.
 </div>

It is necessary, then, to keep our habitual acts under some surveillance of =
attention, to pass them in review for inspection every now and then, that we=
 may discover possible modifications which will make them more serviceable. =
We need to be inventive, constantly to find out better ways of doing things.=
 Habit takes care of our standing, walking, sitting; but how many of us coul=
d not improve his poise and carriage if he would? Our speech has become larg=
ely automatic, but no doubt all of us might remove faults of enunciation, pr=
onunciation or stress from our speaking. So also we might better our78 habit=
s of study and thinking, our methods of memorizing, or our manner of attendi=
ng.

The Tendency of "Ruts."=FF=FFBut this will require something of heroism. For=
 to follow the well-beaten path of custom is easy and pleasant, while to bre=
ak out of the rut of habit and start a new line of action is difficult and d=
isturbing. Most people prefer to keep doing things as they always have done =
them, to continue reading and thinking and believing as they have long been =
in the habit of doing, not so much because they feel that their way is best,=
 but because it is easier than to change. Hence the great mass of us settle =
down on the plane of mediocrity, and become "old fogy." We learn to do thing=
s passably well, cease to think about improving our ways of doing them, and =
so fall into a rut. Only the few go on. They make use of habit as the rest d=
o, but they also continue to attend at critical points of action, and so mak=
e habit an ally in place of accepting it as a tyrant.
4. HABIT-FORMING A PART OF EDUCATION

It follows from the importance of habit in our lives that no small part of e=
ducation should be concerned with the development of serviceable habits. Say=
s James, "Could the young but realize how soon they will become mere walking=
 bundles of habits, they would give more heed to their conduct while in the =
plastic state. We are spinning our own fates, good or evil, and never to be =
undone. Every smallest stroke of virtue or of vice leaves its never-so-littl=
e scar." Any youth who is forming a large number of useful habits is receivi=
ng no meancation, no matter if his knowledge of books may be limited; on=
 the other hand, no one who is forming a large79 number of bad habits is bei=
ng wellcated, no matter how brilliant his knowledge may be.

Youth the Time for Habit-forming.=FF=FFChildhood and youth is the great time=
 for habit-forming. Then the brain is plastic and easily molded, and it reta=
ins its impressions more indelibly; later it is hard to modify, and the impr=
essions made are less permanent. It is hard to teach an old dog new tricks; =
nor would he remember them if you could teach them to him, nor be able to pe=
rform them well even if he could remember them. The young child will, within=
 the first few weeks of its life, form habits of sleeping and feeding. It ma=
y in a few days be led into the habit of sleeping in the dark, or requiring =
a light; of going to sleep lying quietly, or of insisting upon being rocked;=
 of getting hungry by the clock, or of wanting its food at all times when it=
 finds nothing else to do, and so on. It is wholly outside the power of the =
mother or the nurse to determine whether the child shall form habits, but la=
rgely within their power to say what habits shall be formed, since they cont=
rol his acts.

As the child grows older, the range of his habits increases; and by the time=
 he has reached his middle teens, the greater number of his personal habits =
are formed. It is very doubtful whether a boy who has not formed habits of p=
unctuality before the age of fifteen will ever be entirely trustworthy in ma=
tters requiring precision in this line. The girl who has not, before this ag=
e, formed habits of neatness and order will hardly make a tidy housekeeper l=
ater in her life. Those who in youth have no opportunity to habituate themse=
lves to the usages of society may study books on etiquette and employ privat=
e instructors in the art of polite behavior all they please later in life, b=
ut they will never cease to80 be awkward and ill at ease. None are at a grea=
ter disadvantage than the suddenly-grown-rich who attempt late in life to su=
rround themselves with articles of art and luxury, though their habits were =
all formed amid barrenness and want during their earlier years.

The Habit of Achievement.=FF=FFWhat youth does not dream of being great, or =
noble, or a celebrated scholar! And how few there are who finally achieve th=
eir ideals! Where does the cause of failure lie? Surely not in the lack of h=
igh ideals. Multitudes of young people have "Excelsior!" as their motto, and=
 yet never get started up the mountain slope, let alone toiling on to its to=
p. They have put in hours dreaming of the glory farther up, and have never b=
egun to climb. The difficulty comes in not realizing that the only way to be=
come what we wish or dream that we may become is to form the habit of being =
that thing. To form the habit of achievement, of effort, of self-sacrifice, =
if need be. To form the habit of deeds along with dreams; to form the habit =
of doing.

<dir style=3D"color:white; font-size:0.0Who of us has not at this moment lying in wait for his convenience in the di=
m future a number of things which he means to do just as soon as this term o=
f school is finished, or this job of work is completed, or when he is not so=
 busy as now? And how seldom does he ever get at these things at all! Darwin=
 tells that in his youth he loved poetry, art, and music, but was so busy wi=
th his scientific work that he could ill spare the time to indulge these tas=
tes. So he promised himself that he would devote his time to scientific work=
 and make his mark in this. Then he would have time for the things that he l=
oved, and would cultivate his taste for the fine arts. He made his mark in t=
he field of science, and then turned again to poetry, to music, to art. But =
alas! they were all dead and dry bones to him, without life or interest.81 H=
e had passed the time when he could ever form the taste for them. He had for=
med his habits in another direction, and now it was forever too late to form=
 new habits. His own conclusion is, that if he had his life to live over aga=
in, he would each week listen to some musical concert and visit some art gal=
lery, and that each day he would read some poetry, and thereby keep alive an=
d active the love for them.

So every school and home should be a species of habit-factory=FF=FFa place w=
here children develop habits of neatness, punctuality, obedience, politeness=
, dependability and the other graces of character.
