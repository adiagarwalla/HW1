n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

crowds at theaters as this year's domestic movie attendance dips to the 
lowest in 16 years.Robert Downey Jr.'s sequel "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of 
Shadows" debuted on top with a $40 million weekend, off 36 percent 
from the first installment's $62.3 million opening two years ago, according to 
studio estimates Sunday.The first movie opened over Christmas weekend, one of the 
busiest times for movie theaters. Distributor Warner Bros. predicts the "Holmes" sequel, 
which pits Downey's detective against archrival Professor Moriarty, will make up the 
lost ground over the holidays."The pattern is different," said Dan Fellman, th

by their employers over the summer, the protests have continued unabated.Kasymov said 
that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and 
the local branch of the governing Nur Otan party, Kasymov said.Kasymov said 
police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDecember 18, 2011: Remains of destroyed houses, toppled trucks and uprooted trees 
lie along a flood-hit area in Cagayan de Oro city, southern Philippines.ILIGAN, 
Philippines  With funeral parlors overwhelmed, authorities in a flood-stricken southern Philippine 
city on Monday organized the first mass burial of some of nearly 
700 people who were swept to their deaths in one of worst 
calamities to strike the region in decades.For the first time in a 
day, the staggering death toll from Friday night's disaster, spawned by a 
tropical storm, remained little changed but the number of missing varied widely. 
Official figures put the missing at 82, while the Philippine Red Cross 
estimated 800.The disparity underscores the difficulty in accounting for people who could 
be buried in the mud and debris littering much of the area 
or could be alive but lost in crowded evacuation centers or elsewhere."We 
lost count of how many are missing," said Benito Ramos, head of 
the gove
 APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

 contacted at Pyongyang's Koryo Hotel said hotel staff were in tears.Asian 
stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth
