to play with Southwestern flavors so naturally and creatively, elevate it to gourmet level, and yet maintain its authentic homey quality? He is 5980355 most down-to-earth of all 5980355 talented celebrity chefs, and you can feel it in his food. 5980355 restaurant is another story... It's wonderfully trendy and fun, very colorful. 5980355 ambience feels more like a fancy bar, but I love it. We came here to start a night that ended at PURE; a really good way to start your night, it has a great energy. If you're in Vegas and thinking of trying this place, stop thinking and just eat here! We came without reservations on a busy Friday night. 5980355 wait was very long, but they were accommodating and offered to serve us in 5980355 bar area. 5980355 bar tables are pretty small, and could barely fit our party of four. But 5980355 food made up for everything. This is a small restaurant ladies and gentlemen, and it gets PACKED! So please, do yourselves a favor and make a RESERVATION. I had 5980355 ancho-chile marinated salmon, and 5980355 cilantro mashed potatoes. 5980355 red-sauce basted salmon came plated atop a green tomatillo sauce and a black bean sauce. Did I mention i love sauces?! Everything was very flavorful, which makes me happy, but all well-balanced. 5980355 cilantro mashed potatoes were my FAV, I'm a big fan of cilantro. 5980355 best part....wait for it...all 5980355 recipes are available on 5980355 food network website, so you can make Bobby's dishes at home! I'm not sure if they will come out as good, though. I will be making this salmon (with 5980355 sauces) at
