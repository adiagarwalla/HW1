January 2015</strong></p>
<p>Business leaders and politicians spoke out against Black Friday this
week after the imported sales event caused chaos for retailers in
December.</p>
<p>MPs called for a boycott on the American tradition to avoid wasting
police time, while <strong>John Lewis</strong> managing director
<strong>Andy Street</strong> warned of the disruption caused by its sales
peak.</p>
<p>The value of shares in <strong>Argos</strong> owner <strong>Home Retai=
l
Group</strong> fell after it reported like-for-like sales growth of just
0.1 per cent in the 18 weeks to January 3rd despite a 45 per cent increas=
e
on Black Friday itself.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the <strong>Royal Bank of Scotland</strong> began contactin=
g
small business customers who may have been mis-sold loans under the
Enterprise Finance Guarantee scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Burberry</strong>&rsquo;s retail revenues for the last quarter
of 2014 increased by 15 per cent to &pound;604 million, helped in part by
the popularity of its advertising campaign featuring <strong>Romeo
Beckham</strong>.</p>
<p>37 employers including <strong>H&amp;M</strong> and <strong>Welcome
Break</strong> were named and fined by the government for failing to pay
their employees the minimum wage.</p>
<p><strong>BP</strong> announced plans to cut 300 jobs amid falling oil
prices, while <strong>Oil &amp; Gas UK</strong> called for taxes on North
Sea oil fields to be dropped from 80 per cent to 30 per cent.</p>
<p>The operating unit of American casino and hotel firm <strong>Caesars
Entertainment</strong> filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, citing debts of
$18.4 billion.</p>
<p>And fresh from controversy over changes to its Creme Egg recipe,
<strong>Cadbury</strong> announced that 250 jobs will be cut as it invest=
s
&pound;75 million in new equipment at its Bournville factory.</p>
<p>In technology, both <strong>BlackBerry</strong> and
<strong>Samsung</strong> denied talk of a merger after rumours sent the
troubled smartphone manufacturer&rsquo;s shares up by nearly 30 per
cent.</p>
<p><strong>Google</strong> revealed plans for a modular smartphone that
will allow users to swap parts including speakers, cameras and processors
in and out of the device as they wish.</p>
<p>And <em>Business Insider</em> predicted that 35 million people will wa=
nt
to buy the <strong>Apple</strong> Watch when it is released. <strong>Cred=
it
Suisse</strong> believes only 20 million will be made this year.</p>

up...</span></p>
<p>Next week the <strong>Office for National Statistics</strong> will
release its labour market data, with figures on average earnings and
changes in the number of claimants.</p>
<p>The <strong>Confederation of British Industry</strong> will publish it=
s
latest Industrial Trends survey, providing an insight into the health of
the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>And the <strong>Rightmove</strong> House Price Index will provide the
latest figures on the UK&rsquo;s property market.</p>
