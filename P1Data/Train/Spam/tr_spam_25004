Economic assistance for the Palestinians is in jeopardy if they pursue statehood 
recognition in the United Nations over the objections of the United States 
and Israel, which wants to resume negotiation talks.The amount was not spelled 
out, again leaving it to the administration to sort out.The restrictions carry 
a waiver for national security.In a victory for the Democrats and the 
administration, the bill dropped a House-backed ban on federal money for international 
family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide abortion information, counseling 
or referrals.The policy has bounced in and out of law for the 
past quarter century since Republican President Ronald Reagan first adopted it 1984. 
Democrat Bill Clinton ended the ban in 1993, but Republican George W. 
Bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in 
office. Within days of his inauguration, Obama reverse
into bins marked for boy and girls by age group. Obama noted 
more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you,

and intends to support him again.Robin Dein, a 54-year-old homemaker, who is 
an independent, said she supported Republican John McCain in 2008 and has 
not been impressed with Obama's economic policies. She intends to support Romney 
if he wins the Republican nomination."(Obama) spent the first part of his 
presidency blaming Bush for everything, not that he was innocent, and now 
his way of solving anything is by spending more money," she said.Despite 
the soft level of support, many are uncertain whether a Republican president 
would be a better choice. Asked whom they would support next November, 
47 percent of adults favored Obama compared with 46 percent for Romney, 
a former Massachusetts governor. Against Gingrich, the president holds a solid advantage,

Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
