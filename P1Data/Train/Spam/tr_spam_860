. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece insisted on in all my books, and the bes=
t methods of using themdistinctly laid down. The trouble of rightly using s=
uch lessons hascaused them to be almost entirely laid aside in very many ex=
istinginfant schools, and in too many instances the mere learning andrepeat=
ing of sounds by rote, or what may very properly be called the"parrot syste=
m," has been introduced in their place. But I yet hopethat the good sense o=
f the public will in the end remedy such defects.In such cases the memory i=
s the only faculty exercised, and that atthe expense of those that are high=
er. Where this is persisted in, theinfant system is rendered nugatory, and =
my labours are in vain. Ittherefore cannot be too strongly insisted on, and=
 too frequentlyrepeated, that one of its most fundamental principles, as re=
gards theunfolding, properly and easily, of the intellectual faculties, is =
tocommunicate _notions_ and _ideas_ rather than words and sounds, or atleas=
t to let them be done together.As before stated, the gallery had its origin=
 in my desire to teach thechildren simultaneously. It enables a teacher mor=
e readily to securetheir full attention in all oral lessons, and establishe=
s a sympathybetween them. More real facts may be taught children simultaneo=
usly bythe master, than can be taught by all the monitors in a school. Thel=
ittle infants should always sit at the bottom, and by no means beconfined t=
o another room. They can see and hear all that is going on,and understand i=
t far more than you would suppose, though they cannotyet tell all they lear=
n and know; but when the power of speech comes,they will surprise you with =
what they have learned. It is therefore agreat error to separate children a=
nd cut them off from the advantageof all object-lessons, and gallery-teachi=
ng, because they are theyoungest. They learn more through sympathy and comm=
union with theirfive or six year elders, than the most clever adult can tea=
ch them. Aninfant-school, is, in many respects, a community in a state of n=
ature.What one does, the other almost involuntarily learns. The merestinfan=
ts are not an exception to this rule, and therefore theseparation in many i=
nfant-schools of the children, invariably intotwo classes, sometimes in two=
 rooms, is a great mistake, and can onlyarise from ignorance of the laws un=
der which the young mindunfolds itself, and a misunderstanding of the first=
 principles ofinfant-teaching.Perhaps one reason that infant-school teachin=
g has not been kept up to
