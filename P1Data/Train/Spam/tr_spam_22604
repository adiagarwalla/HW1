APJan. 29, 2012: Debris and wreckage lie along the highway after a 
multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near 
Gainesville, Fla. Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup 
on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At 
least five cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into 
flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office 
determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor-trailer as it traveled south early Sunday. The 
driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still not been identified.A 
dozen cars, six tractor-trailers and a motor home collided early Sunday shortl
e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
ble on dealer lots.Businesses also ordered more big-ticket manufactured items in December, 
the government said last week. And orders for so-called core capital goods, 
which are a good measure of businesses' investment plans, reached an all-time 
high last month.Factory output rose in December by the most in a 
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Production rose for goods used in 
the early stages of manufacturing, such as metals, wood products and construction 
materials. That suggests the output of finished goods will pick up.Still, U.S. 
factories are vulnerable to economic shocks.Exports are likely to decline if Europe 
suffers a recession, as many predict.And the key reason the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months 
of last year was that companies restocked their warehouses. That kept helped 
drive factory output at the end of last year.Most economists say that 
restocking is certain to slow in the first quarter of this year.Unl

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 30: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin lights a cande as he 
visits the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery in the town of Tikhvin, about 106 
miles east of St. Petersburg.MOSCOW  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he 
could face a runoff in Russia's presidential vote in March -- his 
first acknowledgment that he may fail to muster enough support for an 
outright victory.Putin's statement Wednesday signaled that he might be willing to accept 
a less dominating father-of-the nation image if he fails to win more 
than 50 percent in the first round on March 4, rather than 
risk igniting more public outrage through blatant vote rigging.Evidence of fraud in 
favor of Putin's party in December's parliamentary election triggered the largest protests 
since the Soviet collapse two decades ago.Putin said at a meeting with 
election monitors that "there is nothing horrible" about a runoff and he's 
ready for one, according to Russian news reports.But he also warned of 
the dange
 uate degrees; among Tea Party movement supporters and Tea Party opponents; among 
those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered 
percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
