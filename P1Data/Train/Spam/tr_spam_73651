<font color="white" size="1">WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia
should be telling other folks to get out of the race and 
get out of my way. If you want to run a race, 
run a race, you don't ask someone to quit just because because 
you think you're the better candidate. I think I'm the better candidate 
but Newt has every right to run," he said.

<font color="white" size="1">APThe logo for Susan G. Komen's Race for the Cure to raise 
awareness for the fight against breast cancerThe Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure Foundation, a leading charity for breast cancer, announced Tuesday that it 
is ceasing its partnership with Planned Parenthood in prevention screenings andcation 
at the health centers across the nation.Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun told The 
Associated Press that the cutoff results from the charity's newly adopted criteria 
barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or 
federal authorities. Aun said this applies to Planned Parenthood because it's the 
focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants
