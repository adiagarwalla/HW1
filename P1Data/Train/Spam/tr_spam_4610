OKLAHOMA CITY  Mitt Romney says he believes marriage should be restricted 
to one man and one woman and that he's held that view 
"since running for office."Romney on Wednesday called same sex-marriage "a very tender 
and sensitive topic" as he contrasted his position with President Barack Obama's 
unequivocal declaration of support Wednesday for allowing same-sex couples to marry.Obama is 
the first president in history to support gay marriage. Polls show the 
country is evenly divided on the issue.Romney did not go so far 
as to accuse Obama of changing his position on the issue. Questioned 
by reporters, the presumptive Republican nominee for president said news reports indicate 
Obama has shifted his stance.Romney says states should be able to decide 
whether to grant certain legal benefits to same-sex couples.

age has been obvious for a long time, even if the words 
were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going 
to create more suffering
 r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem
