Dear Beloved One,

PLEASE ENDEAVOR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.

I am Mrs. Merian Franck, I am married to Dr. Kevin Franck both of us are US=
A citizen's he died in the year 2009. We were married for eleven years with=
out a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days w=
hen he visited his village. Since his death, I decided not to re-marry.

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $15,000,000.00 Unite=
d States Dollars ( Fifteen Million United States Dollars) in a financial In=
stitution. I have been diagnosed with Colon cancer; my Doctor told me that =
I would not last due to the cancer problem. From all indications, the cance=
r has gotten to a very dangerous stage. Having known my condition, I decide=
d to donate this fund to a good person that will utilize this huge amount o=
f money the way i am going to instruct herein.

I want you to use this fund for orphanages, widows and also build schools f=
or less privileges that will be named after my late husband if possible. As=
sure me that you will act accordingly as I state herein. Hoping to receive =
your response immediately through my private email box=C2=A0 merian.franck@=
yahoo.pt

Thanks and Remain blessed.

Yours of Good Heart
Regards,

Mrs. Merian Franck.
