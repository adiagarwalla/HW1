The Kneeling Wheelbarrow - kamasutra sex position

The Kneeling Wheelbarrow sex position is slightly easier than the standing 
version!

The woman takes her weight on one forearm (she uses the other arm for 
balance) and one knee, while her partner kneels http://www.dejardefumarsiqueesposible.com/glissando behind her. He takes hold of her 
hips and enters her while she extends her other leg backwards behind her.

This position is quite tiring for the woman and may be hard to maintain for a long 
period.
