in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.
APMay 2, 2007: Shown here is Fannie Mae's building in Washington.WASHINGTON -- 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought civil fraud charges against six 
former top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying they misled 
the government and taxpayers about risky subprime mortgages the mortgage giants held 
during the housing bust.Those charged include the agencies' two former CEOs, Fannie's 
Daniel Mudd and Freddie's Richard Syron. They are the highest-profile individuals to 
be charged in connection with the 2008 financial crisis.Mudd, 53, and Syron, 
68, led the mortgage giants when the housing bubble burst in late 
2006 and 2007. The four other top executives also worked for the 
companies during that time.The case was filed in federal court in New 
York City.In a statement released through his attorney, Mudd said the lawsuit 
"should never have been brought" and said the government reviewed and approved 
all of the company's financial disclosures."Every p

<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was
 WASHINGTON  The House has passed a $1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill 
paying for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments and averting a government 
shutdown, while Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut and jobless 
benefits reached a critical phase.The 296-121 vote to approve the spending measure 
represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in a polarized Capitol. The Senate's 
top Republican, meanwhile, raised the stakes in the showdown over the payroll 
tax cut, insisting he won't back a compromise extension unless the bill 
includes language aimed at forcing construction of a Canada-to-Texas pipeline.As negotiations on 
the payroll tax bill proceeded Friday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
said, "I will not be able to support the package that doesn't 
include the pipeline."The GOP's pipeline demands added uncertainty to efforts by McConnell 
and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to quickly reach a deal 
on a bill renewing payroll tax 
 BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
