ReutersFILE 2009: Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki gestures during talks with his 
Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazif in Cairo.BAGHDAD  Iraq's parliament reconvened Tuesday after 
Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian 
political fight has been accompanied by a surge in violence, killing more 
than 200 people this month and raising fears of a civil war.Iraqiya 
leaders lifted the parliament ban on Sunday, and m
Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department 
has ston
ook disciplinary action -- but did not terminate -- three senior supervisors 
there for their role in the mismanagement. Those disciplined included Air Force 
Col. Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of 
the incidents, and two civilian supervisors -- Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel.Edmondson 
was given a letter of reprimand; denied a job commanding a unit 
at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.; and barred from future command assignments. 
Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to 
non-supervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on 
the matter.Although the Special Counsel did not identify the three accused of 
retaliating against the whistleblowers, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and 
Keel. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
because of privacy restrictions.James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician who has been identified

executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and 
Paul stands wi

Jordan Tuesday en route to Israel and the Palestinian Authority in an 
effort to restart the talks."We must all do our part to break 
this impasse," Ban said. "In the short term, it is essential that 
provocations stop as called for by the Quartet and that the parties 
build confidence and sustain these nascent talks."The Palestinians have rejected Netanyahu's latest 
moves."They are adding obstacles at a time when everyone is intensifying efforts 
to try to resume peace talks," said Palestinian government spokesman Ghassan Khatib. 
"I think with every additional settlement activity, the feasibility of having two
