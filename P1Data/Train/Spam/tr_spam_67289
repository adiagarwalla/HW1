<p style="font-size:xx-small;">rassment complaint against Morgan for unwanted and insulting phone calls and emails, 
but ended up not pursuing criminal charges.At the trial, a police detective 
read aloud an email Justin-Jinich sent to Morgan in December 2008. She 
wrote: "I am so tired of you STALKING me. Leave me alone! 
... YOU are the type of person that women take self-defense classes 
to protect themselves against."A day before Justin-Jinich's email, Morgan wrote an email 
to her saying, "When you were upset about not communicating anymore, I 
thought it was because you needed me. But it was all stupid 
because I didn't have a clue what I was doing at the 
time."In her response, Justin-Jinich said she'd go to police if she ever 
saw him in person, and she would defend herself if necessary.She wrote: 
"I don't know what went wrong in your childhood or your adult 
life thus far to make you feel like you have some right 
to sexually harass me, to track me down on my various email 
accounts, to feel 
 minated to keep a 2008 campaign pledge. To appease possible dissenters, the 
government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.
 WASHINGTON  Michelle Obama is urging people to give to charities for 
the holiday season as she brought more than 800 gifts Friday from 
White House staff to donate to the U.S. Marine Corps Toys for 
Tots campaign.The first lady also got a surprise invitation from a soldier 
to be his date at next year's Marine Corps Ball.Lance Cpl. Aaron 
Leeks, 20, of Frederick, Md., said he asked Obama to accompany him 
because he's a fan and admires her work to support the military.When 
Obama was sorting toys at the charity event and came close to 
Leeks, he leaned over a toy bin and got her attention to 
pop the question. The first lady smiled and called over a staff 
member as she chatted with Leeks."She said she'd love to go," Leeks 
said. "Actually, she said I'd need to speak to her husband, too, 
but she said she'd love to."Leeks said he plans to follow up 
on his invitation. In January, he will be deployed for the first 
time to Afghanistan but plans to attend the ball when he'
