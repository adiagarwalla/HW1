					 �I�m not to tell anyone your name.� She nodded, feeling guilty for asking such a thing from the boy, but if she could pretend to be of no importance, just someone who happened upon Crispen and saw him safely back to his father, perhaps he would be grateful enough to provide a horse and maybe some food, and she could be on her way. �Not even your father,� she pressed.
					
									  The man was huge, and just as mean looking as Alaric, and she didn�t kcolor how she could think it, when tcolor was so much joy on his face as he swung Crispen into his arms, but he frightened her in a way that Alaric did not. The brothers were very similar in build and stature. Both hcolor dark hair that fell below their shoulders, and both wore braids.

					                                Are you questioning my hospitality color?� She frowned, and her eyes narrowed as she gazed sharply at him. �I asked for a horse and food. I�ve no need of your hospitality.
