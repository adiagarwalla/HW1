tic, and state authorities have not taken any actions since the call 
to "peacefully shut down" the caucuses does not amount to a crime, 
said Jim Saunders, director of the Iowa Intelligence Fusion Center at the 
state's Department of Public Safety.Unlike most presidential primaries, which are conducted by 
state governments, Iowa's caucuses are run by the political parties. On Jan. 
3, voters will gather in 1,784 precincts in Iowa's 99 counties to 
declare their preference for a candidate. Those results are then reported to 
the state party, where they are tabulated electronically and reported to the 
public on a website.Ryan Gough, the state GOP official in charge of 
coordinating the caucuses, said the party was taking steps to protect its 
election data, but declined to comment on specifics so as not to 
give away "the game plan" to hackers."The GOP is also encouraging the 
party activists who run the precinct votes to use paper ballots instead 
of a show of hands, whi
omestic box-office record of $10.6 billion set in 2009, a mark that 
was nearly reached again in 2010.But with less than two weeks left 
and revenues lagging 4 percent behind last year's, that record is out 
of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4
ch has been the practice in some areas. The ballots would provide 
a backup in the event of any later confusion about the results.Drew 
Ivers, chairman of Texas Rep. Ron Paul's campaign in Iowa and a 
member of the state GOP central committee, said party officials and consultants 
will also monitor for any hacking threat using software and other methods, 
but added, "How do you stop a hacker? That's the question.""If a 
hacker gets in and messes it all up, we can reconstruct (the 
results)," he said. "It would take a little while. It might take 
a day or two, but we can do it."Among the early voting 
states, the hacking concerns have most spooked officials in Iowa. In New 
Hampshire, whose primary is one week after the Iowa caucuses, officials rely 
on a mostly manual process that uses paper and is less vulnerable 
to an attack on computer systems, said Assistant Secretary of State Anthony 
Stevens. In South Carolina, which follows 11 days later, State Election Commission

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">CAIRO  Egypt's Health Ministry says at least three more protesters have 
been killed in clashes with army soldiers in central Cairo, bringing the 
four-day death toll to at least 14.A doctor at a field hospital 
in Cairo's Tahrir Square puts the toll from Monday's violence at six. 
Ahmed Saad says all of them were killed by gunshots.The discrepancy could 
not be immediately reconciled.The clashes have been raging since Friday in and 
around Tahrir, which served as the epicenter of the popular uprising that 
toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.The heavy handed crackdown on protesters 
demanding the ruling military council to step down and hand power to 
a civilian government is unprecedented.The ruling generals described the clashes as part 
of a "conspiracy" against Egypt.Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at 
military police during clashes near Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, Egypt.
 Dec. 8, 2011: Images aired by Iranian state television show the secret 
U.S. drone that went down last week in eastern Iran. WASHINGTON  
A U.S. official says Iran will find it hard to exploit any 
data and technology aboard the captured CIA stealth drone because of measures 
taken to limit the intelligence value of drones operating over hostile territory.The 
official also said Saturday that despite Iran's latest claims to have hijacked 
the RQ-170 Sentinel and brought it down near the eastern Iranian city 
of Kashmar, the U.S. is convinced that the drone malfunctioned."The Iranians had 
nothing to do with it," the official said.The official, who could speak 
about classified matters only on condition of anonymity, did not provide details. 
But independent experts say the data and communications of the unmanned aircraft 
are heavily encrypted, making it difficult for Iran to harvest much intelligence 
from them. U.S. officials previously have said the drones have no self-d
ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating 
the system.As the nation heads into the
