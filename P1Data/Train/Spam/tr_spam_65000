      Your doctor has probably told you fish oil is great for heart health.<br>
      <br>
      But they probably didn’t tell you, because they don’t know, that<br>
      fish oil can be VERY dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      Many fish oils are made with toxic farmed fish that live and grow<br>
      in their own feces.<br>
      <br>
      Others have mercury contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Most all of them give you disgusting “fish burps.”<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, for those of us deathly <a href="http://nfsblog.com/51gz43542l1"><strong><u>afraid of having a heart attack</u></strong></a>,<br>
      <br>
      there’s something pure from the most remote regions of earth that<br>
      is WAY more powerful than fish oil.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the fish oil companies stand to lose BILLIONS because of this<br>
      secret nutrient I’m about to reveal.<br>

<p> She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor any thing else, awakened a suspicion of the truth. The evening passed quietly, unmarked by any thing extraordinary. The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather knew that she was happy, than felt herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils before her. She anticipated what wouldbe felt in the family when her situation became known; she was aware that no one liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away. At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far from Miss Bennet's general habits, she was absolutely inclous here. "You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!-engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible." "This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
