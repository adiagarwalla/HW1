in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
o ease the lines by clearing pilots in advance. Some airports have 
a test program and waive us through (Baltimore has this in some 
terminals for example), but others are still struggling to implement it. For 
now, we must go through the same charades as passengers except it 
really is pointless for us.Do you ever hear qualms from passengers about 
your young age?Occasionally, we will hear people commenting that we look like 
kids. But, its really all relative and a matter of perspective. What 
we hear most often is people exclaiming how small the plane is 
or their reference to it as a puddle jumper. This, too, is 
relative and most often heard by infrequent flyers. Seasoned travelers know that 
as many as half of domestic flights today (if not more) are 
operated by regional jets. The flight decks on these aircraft are just 
as modern as mainline aircraft. In fact, most regional jets are fairly 
new from the past decade or so, and they can fly distances

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign identified its top fundraisers on Tuesday, including 
61 people who each raised at least half a million dollars. Altogether, 
the more than 440 fundraisers collected at least $75 million to help 
Obama win a second term.Among them are embattled former New Jersey Gov. 
Jon Corzine. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee late last year 
returned $70,000 in contributions from Corzine and his wife following questions about 
the collapse of MF Global, the financial firm Corzine ran.Corzine is no 
longer raising money for the re-election, campaign officials said.The campaign divided the 
list into four groups based on how much money donors raised: $50,000-$100,000, 
$100,000-$200,000, $200,000 to $500,000 and those who raised more than $500,000 apiece.The 
donors represent a broad network of contributors, many of them longtime Democratic 
Party stalwarts.The list includes two fundraisers linked to Solyndra LLC, the Cal

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be 
abl
 percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for
