APJanuary 31, 2012: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell delivers a 
speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as 
South Korea is
ssageway. Burgess said the "concern" is over how long Iran would sustain 
that closure.As for Al Qaeda, Clapper said bin Laden's death deprived global 
jihadists of their "most iconic and inspirational leader."The new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, 
is "less charismatic," he said.In the document presented to Congress, Clapper also 
said that the ability of Al Qaeda's core leadership "has weakened significantly." 
With sustained pressure, he said, "we anticipate that core Al Qaeda will 
suffer sustained degradation, diminished cohesion and decreasing influence in the coming year."However, 
Clapper said Al Qaeda remains a threat. While the core will be 
of "symbolic importance" to the movement, he said Tuesday, the affiliates will 
"drive the global jihad agenda."Several of these affiliates, like Al Shabaab in 
Somalia, are focused mostly on fighting in their own countries, and not 
on global jihad. But he said in his written assessment that Al 
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is
e manufactured by Pfizer and marketed by Akrimax Pharmaceuticals and shipped to 
warehouses, clinics and retail pharmacies nationwide, the company said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile

 nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many

APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
