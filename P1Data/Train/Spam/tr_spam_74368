<font style="color: #FCFCFC">TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of

most since July 2008. The increase in U.S. job openings suggests that 
weaker hiring gains in March and April could be temporary. It usually 
takes one to three months for employers to fill openings.

prohibiting any spending on implementing an international agreement on activities in space 
unless the pact has been ratified by the Senate or authorized by 
law.The idea of another round of domestic base closings lost by a 
44-18 vote. Lawmakers have challenged the savings from previous closings. Defense Secretary 
Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal
