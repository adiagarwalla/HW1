This is an email from Penyrheol Comprehensive School

Dear Parent/Guardian,

I am writing to invite you to the Year 9 Options Parents' Evening on the 22nd of January 2015. The formal part of the Options Evening will be held in the Theatre and will run from 4:30 until 5:30. Before this there will be an ``options fayre'' held in the canteen from 3:00 until 4:00. 

Many option subjects will have a stall manned by pupils and/or the Head of Department. They will be available to answer any questions about the subject and show exemplar work. The idea behind the fayre is to give pupils and parents a better insight into what each subject actually entails to enable a more informed options choice. We look forward to seeing you in the canteen from 3:00 on the 22nd.

Yours Sincerely

D Benney
Deputy Headteacher

Penryheol Comprehensive School
Pontarddulais Road, Gorseinon, Swansea SA4 4FG

Headteacher/Pennaeth: Alan Tootill
Tel: (01792) 533066
