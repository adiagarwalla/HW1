The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A
he Tennessean.The Tennessee Office of Vital Records does not have a divorce 
on record, The Tennessean reports.But The Tennesean has the April 22 wedding 
announcement all right, which states John and Tricianne Taylor were married on 
January 14.Cowboy boots and yellow roses accented the ambiance of the couples 
Texas heritage. The groom wore a white linen suit accented with a 
gold Parthenon tie, gift from the bride," it reads.Mary Witherspoon also says 
in court documents that she confronted Taylor, but that she refused to 
speak to her or respond to a letter in which Mary informed 
her John was still married.Mary Witherspoon also alleges Taylor is trying to 
borrow money as Ms. John Witherspoon, has gotten John to change his 
will, and is living in a condo owned by Reese, the report 
says.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv

entered Aimee's body through the gash she had received during the zip 
lining accident.RELATED: Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria) - Treatment OverviewThe surgeons advised me 
that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this 
point saving her life took precedence, Aimees father wrote on the Facebook 
page. They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she 
would have limited, if any use of her leg.Aimee was then airlifted 
to JMS Burn Center in Augusta, Ga., where doctors rushed her into 
surgery and performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg. After surgery, 
Copeland suffered cardiac arrest, but the doctors were able to resuscitate her. 
It was at this point that the doctors told Copeland and his 
wife that Aimees chances of survival were slim to none.We actually sat 
down with her cardio pulmonologist, Copeland said. I understand he was try

the world's largest solid rocket motor, which was originally designed to be 
the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will 
use the original Ares 1 engine as a first stage and European 
aerospace firm Astrium's workhorse Ariane 5 rocket as the second stage. The 
massive Liberty rocket will tower at 300 feet (91 meters) tall, company 
officials have said. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]"Liberty can 
lift more than any other system," Rominger said. "Our capabilities can carry 
seven crew and significant cargo, which I think is unique. We really

happen for Aimee Copeland. Through the page, friends and family also have 
been calling for blood donations to help save Aimees life. So far, 
the page has garnered over 17,000 followers, all sending their thoughts and 
prayers to the Copeland family. The bottom line is that I've been 
asking people to pray and give blood, Copeland said. I want to 
create awareness about giving blood for this particular disease. Blood is required 
to save her.Copeland says that he is certain his daughter will make
