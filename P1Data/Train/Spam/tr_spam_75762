yne, a Sydney-based aviation expert. "But if it's pilot error or the 
fault of air traffic control, it won't be quite so bad because 
they'll be able to say, 'Well, it's not the airplane'."The Superjet made 
its inaugural commercial flight last year."It is their big hope that they 
will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger 
way than they have," Ballantyne said."We all know that the Russians have 
had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this 
was vitally important to their industry."With a relatively low price tag of 
around $35 million, the plane has garnered around 170 orders. And Indonesia, 
the world's fourth most populous nation with a fast-growing middle class, is 
already one of the biggest customers.Kartika Airlines, Sky Aviation and Queen Air 
-- among dozens of airlines to have popped up in Indonesia in 
the last decade to meet the growing demand for cheap air travel 
-- had ordered a total of at least 48.All but 10 of 
s all platforms and strongly believe that having great competitors makes us 
all work harder."40 percent of 911 calls mistakenly "butt-dialed""In the end, consumers 
and developers benefit the most from robust competition.The issue is how the 
application is written. Some Windows apps rely on the powerful Win32 APIs 
Microsoft has built for programmers, apps like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word 
. They wont run on ARM-powered Windows devices (basically any Windows tablets).Those 
APIs are necessary for modern browsers, argued Mozilla spokesman Asa Dotzler -- 
and only Internet Explorer will have access.Without that access, no other browser 
has a prayer of being competitive with IE, he wrote.Sign up for

and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to

generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being

that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation
