 rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from

morning commute.Quebec Premier Jean Charest condemned the attack, saying he hopes the 
guilty parties are found.The incident occurred near the peak of Thursday morning 
rush hour. Most service was restored just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).Subway

precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But

supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the

except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than
