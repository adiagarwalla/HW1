ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
or has been notoriously erratic, making predictions about its intentions difficult. However, 
they said they believed there would not be significant changes in North 
Korean policies under Kim's son and heir apparent Kim Jong Un until 
at least after the mourning period ends.Kim's death came as the Obama 
administration was debating whether to go ahead with a new round of 
nuclear disarmament talks with the North and whether to provide food aid 
to the country, which has been struggling with crippling food shortages.The administration 
had been poised to announce a significant donation of food aid to 
North Korea this week, the first concrete accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes 
diplomatic contacts between the two wartime enemies, according to sources close to 
the negotiations. And, an agreement by North Korea to suspend its controversial 
uranium enrichment program was expected to follow within days, the sources said.Suspension 
of uranium enrichment by North
king the can down the road.""The American people are tired of that. 
I think, frankly, I'm tired of it. On the House side, we've 
seen this kind of action before coming out of the Senate. It's 
time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend 
this for one year," Boehner said.But Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Boehner 
has no room to complain after agreeing last week to abide by 
a deal worked out between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell. House Republicans have said they played no role in 
last week's talks between the two Senate leaders"Last week, Speaker Boehner sat 
in a meeting with Leader Reid and Leader McConnell and he gave 
Leader McConnell his proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. ... The Senate 
came to a deal, and now Speaker Boehner must keep his word," 
Schumer said in a statement release Sunday.Schumer said failure to pass the 
legislation could cost Republicans their majority in the House, "and

be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as 
possible before the election since it allows the Blue Team to decry 
Republicans as the puppets of the 1 percent for opposing a millionaires 
tax hike to offset the funds being denied to the already insolvent 
Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill 
and the tax holiday doesnt expire until Dec. 31. The effort of

Speaker John Boehner had secretly agreed to jam through the short Senate

them in their sleep.Residents told local officials that plans for a mass 
burial was "un-Christian," said Cagayan de Oro city administrator Griscelda Joson.Mayor Vicente 
Emano called a meeting later Monday to discuss the problem. Funeral parlors 
have asked authorities to do something about the unclaimed bodies because of 
the stench and complaints from neighbors, she said.More bodies continue to be 
found. While city officials were meeting Sunday, more than 40 bodies were 
seen floating off an island but the coast guard could not recover 
them, Joson said.In a grim sign of desperation, a funeral parlor dumped 
about 30 badly decomposed bodies in a city garbage dump over the 
weekend, sparking protests from distraught villagers who were looking for the missing 
loved ones.Ramos, the head of the agency that is spearheading the recovery a
