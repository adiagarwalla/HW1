 The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was
specially toys and children's clothes set aside by impoverished parents.Before she left 
the store Tuesday evening, the Indianapolis woman in her mid-40s had paid 
the layaway orders for as many as 50 people. On the way 
out, she handed out $50 bills and paid for two carts of 
toys for a woman in line at the cash register."She was doing 
it in the memory of her husband who had just died, and 
she said she wasn't going to be able to spend it and 
wanted to make people happy with it," Deppe said. The woman did 
not identify herself and only asked people to "remember Ben," an apparent 
reference to her husband.Deepe, who said she's worked in retail for 40 
years, had never seen anything like it."It was like an angel fell 
out of the sky and appeared in our store," she said.Most of 
the donors have done their giving secretly.Dona Bremser, an Omaha nurse, was 
at work when a Kmart employee called to tell her that someone 
had paid off the $70 balance of her layaway account, wh
make sure their skills are up to snuff. Fox News got a 
rare peek inside their training.After surrendering cell phones, cameras and a list 
of other prohibited items, guests to the plant must check in with 
photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. Theres a security briefing and 
then a winding drive through checkpoints to arrive at the virtual security 
training center. Step inside and it takes a few minutes for your 
eyes to adjust to the light. Then you see the guns. And 
the humvee. These are facing large movie-like screens that run from floor 
to ceiling and wall to wall. Trainers can project different scenarios on 
the screens while security officers are put through the paces. The guns 
feel real because they are.But instead of ammo, theyre outfitted with compressed 
air so they will they feel real when theyre shot. There are 
also cameras to record the training so that the officers can receive 
feedback once its finished.The two large rooms in the virtual

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">NEW YORK  Some 55 people have been charged with forming a 
New York City fraud ring that used members' jobs at a prominent 
charity and other places to steal financial information from wealthy donors and 
customers.Arraignments were expected Friday in the case.Prosecutors say in indictments that participants 
in the scheme had jobs that involved processing donor or customer checks. 
One worked at the UJA-Federation, a major Jewish charity.Prosecutors say she and 
other members of the ring harvested people's personal information from the checks 
and provided it to accomplices.Then the accomplices would forge checks, deposit them 
in still other associates' bank accounts and withdraw the money as soon 
as it cleared.UJA-Federation says it worked with authorities and fired the employee.

to win between about $50 million to $100 million apiece in prize 
money. The winnings are to help build statewide systems that affect all 
early learning programs, including child care, Head Start centers and public or 
private preschools.Billions are spent annually in America on earlycation programs, but 
the quality and availability of those programs varies greatly. Roughly half of 
all 3-year-olds and about a quarter of 4-year-olds do not attend preschool, 
said Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research 
at Rutgers University.Kids who attend quality earlycation programs have been shown 
to do better in school, be less likely to spend time in 
prison later and to make more money as adults. But children from 
low-income families who start kindergarten without any schooling are estimated to start 
school 18 months behind their peers, a gap that is extremely dif

rights and political and religious dissenters. Convicted in 2006 of subversion and 
sentenced to three years, he was quickly released on probation before being 
taken away by security agents in 2009 in the first of his 
forced disappearances that set off an international outcry.The Xinhua report referred to 
his 2006 subversion conviction and said Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court 
found that Gao "had seriously violated probation rules for a number of 
times, which led to the court decision to withdraw the probation."The report 
did not explain what violations Gao had committed but said his five-year 
probation was due to expire next Thursday -- timing which legal experts 
said may have prompted the government to send Gao back to jail. 
"He would serve his term in prison in the next three years," 
the report said.Calls to the No. 1 court and the city's appeals
