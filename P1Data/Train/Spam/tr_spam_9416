Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message with 
"advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word "advertisement" is in 
quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box cannot be called an advertisement. 
We assure you that we never sent these messages and have no relationship to 
this mailing. The fact is that at the end of August, we received a requirement 
from a distributor of harmful dietary supplements to remove an article about 
this harmful dietary supplements from our website Pohudeu.com. Because they 
have not provided any facts to refute our article, we have not agreed to 
remove it. Next they started this spam campaign to compromise our reputation, 
so that we would be closed for spamming. Our project Pohudeu.com is completely 
non commercial. We don't sell any kind of stuff, products or services, we 
don't earn on advertising. From early September our website Pohudeu.com was 
under continual DDoS attacks. Nevertheless, we truly hope that spam-mailing 
and DDoS attacks will stop soon. We cannot tell when this campaign against our 
website Pohudeu.com will be end. We are sorry for this inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
