<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Went here for lunch on a weekday...  Inside dining area was empty.. The outside patio was pretty full, but we were able to be seated right away in a comfortable booth. Gorgeous views of the water and DT SD, 4305055 I love! Ambience is dressy/casual, you know what I mean? 

Our server was friendly. Plenty of staff who were very attentive. Drinks kept full and our table kept clean. 

Crab cake- my parents enjoyed... 4305055 Presented nicely and with good flavor. The crusted Brie- OMG, I loved it. Completely amazeBalls! Cut into it, and the warm Brie oozes out. The cheese itself is pretty mild, but add a little of the the jalape??o jelly that comes with it, and it's the perfect combination. The jelly is not even spicy and just sweet enough. Yummy. Served with some dark greens and toasted bread. Now I want more!... Kids got the Mac&cheese and mini burger from the kids menu. I was surprised by the generous serving size. The Mac&cheese has a nice mild cheese flavor. Lamb sandwich- I did not try it, but check out my pic, it looked tasty!... I had the their Burger... I was hesitant at first, debating whether I should try something else... But our server assured me that it's a signature item on their lunch menu... Normally served with steak fries, I requested a side salad. The salad was a nice mix of dark greens with a light coat of vinegraitte with a simple, pleasing flavor. Now onto the burger. Topped with great fresh and grilled veggies (the classics)... And a nice slice of cheese (you choose which kind).. Oh and crunchy bacon... f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c On a nicely toasted (but still soft) bun. I approve. dessert- so we had something called like a banana split.. Omg it was delicious. Served with a large scoop of homemade PB ice cream, a gooey brownie baked in a ramekin, whipped cream, crunchy sugar glaze. Definitely rich and large enough to share. But oh so delicious. 

Overall, the friendly service, yummy food, awesome views make this place totally worth it... I would love to come back again and try their salads.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
