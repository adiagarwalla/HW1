<font color="white" size="1">keptical about the handling of the accident and the investigation.The Cabinet statement 
cited "serious design flaws and major safety risks" and what it said 
were a string of errors in equipment procurement and management. It also 
criticized the Railways Ministry's rescue efforts.The report affirmed earlier government statements that 
a lightning strike caused one bullet train to stall and then a 
sensor failure and missteps by train controllers allowed a second train to 
keep moving on the same track and slam into it.Those singled out 
for blame included former Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun, a bullet train 
booster who was detained in February amid a graft investigation. Also criticized 
was the general manager of the company that manufactured the signal, who 
died of a heart attack while talking to investigators in August.The decision 
to assign blame to one figure who already has been jailed and 
another who is dead, along with mid-level managers who have been fired,
APNovember 3, 2009: Sen. Ben. Nelson talks to reporters about health care 
on Capitol Hill. WASHINGTON  Democrats lamented U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson's decision 
to retire rather than seek a third term in Nebraska, fearing the 
move sets up Republicans for an easy and crucial victory in their 
effort to reclaim control of the chamber next year.Nelson, the lone Democrat 
in Nebraska's five-member congressional delegation, faced a tough re-election campaign against a 
large group of Republican challengers who have spent the past several months 
attacking his support for President Barack Obama's health care overhaul and federal 
stimulus legislation.Republicans must net four seats to take back the Senate in 
2012, and Nebraska now looks to be an easy pickup. There are 
no Democrats in line to take Nelson's place in the increasingly conservative 
state. He joins several other Democrats to retire from the Senate, including 
Virginia's Jim Webb and North Dakota's Kent Conrad.After mont

<font color="white" size="1"> to serve China's poor majority.Beijing is rapidly expanding China's 56,000-mile rail 
network, which is overloaded with passengers and cargo. But it has scaled 
back plans amid concern about whether the railway ministry can repay its 
mounting debts.On Friday, the current railways minister, Sheng Guangzu, announced railway construction 
spending next year will be cut to about $65 billion, down from 
this year's projected $75 billion.A failure to expand rail capacity could choke 
economic growth because exporters away from China's coast rely on rail to 
get goods to ports.The rail ministry's reported debt is $300 billion. Analysts 
say its revenues are insufficient to repay that. That has prompted concern 
the ministry might need to be bailed out by Chinese taxpayers.
