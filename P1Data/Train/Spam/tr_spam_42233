Hi Ian,

Charlie came home from school yesterday with a timetable for extra 
maths lessons after school, something that his teacher has organised. In view 
of this we have decided not to carry on with the tutoring, particularly as one 
of the days he is staying behind at school is on a wednesday.

Sorry for 
messing you about, I hope you understand.

I'll be back in touch if anything 
changes.

Thanks Ian

Joanne
