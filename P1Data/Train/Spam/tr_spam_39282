air of rainbows and a brilliant new star. Soviet records, however, indicate 
he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115
ndations and have not yet made any decisions on implementation. During the 
deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi
ublicans like the looks of staying in session while the president frets 
about the start of his annual Hawaiian family getaway. Obama put his 
own vacation at risk when he warned Republicans to stay at work 
until the payroll tax issue was resolved. They are now turning the 
tables on him.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and 
his POWER PLAY column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t NBC show removed from all in-flight entertainment.#8. George Lopez, Brett Ratner, 
Tracy Morgan and Katt WilliamsWho hurled the most hurtful slurs of 2011? 
Let's go to the videotape. Lopez ignited a war of words when 
he compared Dancing With the Stars contestant Kirstie Alley, who has long 
struggled with her weight, to a pig. Rush Hour director Ratner resigned 
as producer of the 2012 Academy Awards after angering the gay and 
lesbian community by using the derogatory f word during a speech at 
a movie screening. Tracy Morgan said in a comedy routine that if 
he would kill his son if he turned out gay. And Williams 
also upset a number of people when he ranted about Mexicans, fighting 
a heckling audience member by stating that they should go back to 
their country.#7 and #6. Camille Grammer and her ex KelseyThe former star 
of the popular Bravo reality show The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills 
embarrassed Kelsey -- and the viewing public -- by making such remarks 

 e anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks in a breach that rattled U.S. foreign relations 
and, according to the government, imperiled valuable military and diplomatic sources. Defense 
attorneys argue the leaked material did little or no damage to U.S. 
interests.Fulton provided details of a confrontation that finally got Manning banned from 
the workplace. She said Spc. Jirhleah Showman grew angry after she was 
summoned from her bed to work, and saw Manning there, apparently playing 
a video game.Fulton said she heard Manning tell Showman to calm down. 
Fulton testified that she heard terse words exchanged, followed by shuffling sounds, 
and then saw Manning pinning Showman to the floor."She said he had 
struck her and she had a welt on her face," Fulton said.Another 
government witness, Sgt. Chad Madaras, testified that Manning was sometimes sullen and 
unresponsive, especially toward Adkins."He would sit down at his work station and 
kind of ignore everyone," Madaras said under
tuation two months from now, while at the same time potentially imperiling 
the pipeline project itself.The language in the tax cut bill does not 
force Obama to approve the project. Rather, it states that he must 
either approve the permit in 60 days or declare that it is 
not in the national interest and reject it.The issue has the president 
caught awkwardly between two vital Democratic constituencies -- the unions and the 
environmentalists.Republicans hope that in an election year, Obama will side with those 
pushing for job creation and approve the permit. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
told Fox News it would be "crazy" to deny the project just 
to please "radical" environmentalists.But White House officials signaled the president might just 
reject the project after 60 days, given that the State Department already 
has said it simply can't review the pipeline within that timeframe.The administration 
potentially could argue that Republicans forced the president's hand by
