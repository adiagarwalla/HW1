X17Online.comJune 25: Britney Spears and boyfriend Jason Trawick head out for a 
romatic weekend in Palm Springs, CA. Jason Trawickmay have jumped the engagement

and she said yes!Spears just went to herFacebookpage and wrote, "OMG. Last 
night Jason surprised me with the one gift I've been waiting for. 
Can't wait toshowyou! SO SO SO excited!!!! Xxo."TMZ broke the story that 
Trawick had planned to ask for Britney's hand in marriage during their 
trip to Vegas, and the smart money was that it was all 
supposed to go down tonight. But it seems that he just couldn't 
wait.Click here to follow FOX411 on Facebook and Twitter.Sources close to the

or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
  was overloaded and all police helicopter pilots were on vacation at 
the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were
ause of "great worry" and said he would urge China once more 
to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be 
the most prominent government critic to be
