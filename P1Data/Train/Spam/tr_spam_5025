UniversalDoc Brown, the crazy inventor from Back to the Future, may not 
have perfected his mind-reading contraption, but real scientists are still trying.BERKELEY, Calif. 
 You may idly wish you could hear what others are thinking 
yet write off telepathy as science fiction. But one day, the ability 
to read peoples minds may not be a talent reserved for psychics 
and the X-Men.A group of neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
reported they may have come up with a scientific way to read 
peoples minds.Led by post-doctoral researcher Brian Pasley, the scientists have developed a 
method for deciphering the electrical signals in a persons brain as they 
listen to words or conversation.Upon figuring out these signals, they were then 
able to use them to recreate the imagined speech of the same 
person.The secret to their method lies in the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is used in auditory perception. When a person hears a 
word or phrase being spok
nizant of this."
nt moderate who would get marginalized in the general election. This time, 
Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more

be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If 
Romneys week of blistering high-dollar, high-frequency attacks on Gingrichs character have hurt 
enough, conservatives unable to vote for the more moderate former Massachusetts governor 
but anxious

 d William Wilson the right to information concerning Goodman's adoption.The civil trial 
is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
