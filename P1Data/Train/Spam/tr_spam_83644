 with the housekeeper 14 years ago.The Terminators 25-year marriage to Maria 
Shriver was promptly terminated. Meanwhile, disgraced New York-based Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner 
was forced to resign after accidentally tweeting lewd photos of himself to 
his followers, young admirers and a former porn actress in a saga 
branded Weinergate. He continued to lie and claim to have been hacked, 
before finally fessing up and stepping down, and it was consequently affirmed 
that his wife, Huma Abedin  a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton 
 was pregnant with their first child. Yieks.#2. Lindsay LohanThe trials and 
tribulations of Lindsay Lohan have earned her a spot on this list 
four times in the past five years. In 2007, Lohan was number 
four, in 2009 she scored number seven, in 2010 she was number 
three and this year she has climbed to number two. The troubled 
actress kicked off the year by being charged with the theft of 
a necklace from a boutique in Venice, and was
h smaller populations had the highest number of state workers per 1,000 
residents, led by Alaska, Delaware (18.7), Connecticut (17.6) and Wyoming (16.7).The fifth-highest 
rate was in Virginia, where there were 14.4 state employees per 1,000 
people despite the state shedding nearly 1,700 state workers between the 2007 
and 2011 budget years.Virginia's high level of state employees may be linked 
to its ranking third in the country in state-maintained highways, although successive 
governors have sought to chip away at the number of road workers 
employed by the state.Only 12 states bucked the trend of dropping state 
workers from the rolls.In Texas, the number of state government employees rose 
by more than 7,300 between 2007 and 2011. But Mark Miner, a 
spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry, stressed that the state's rising population 
meant the number of state workers dropped from 6.07 to 6.02 as 
measured per capita. Perry is seeking the GOP presidential nomination
trengthen EPA as an organization and a leader in the nations progress 
toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

1970's it released its first turbocharged model -- the landmark Saab 99.To 
auto enthusiasts, Saab was known for its quirks such as placing the 
ignition lock between the front seats and becoming the first car to 
have heated seating in 1971.GM bought a 50 percent stake and management 
control of Saab in 1989, and gained full ownership in 2000. The 
aircraft and defense company with the same name remained an independent entity, 
building fighter jets and weapons systems.Saab Automobile's sales peaked at 133,000 cars 
in 2006. After that, sales dwindled to 93,000 cars in 2008 and 
just 27,000 in 2009, as GM -- itself in bankruptcy protection following 
the financial crisis -- prepared to wind down the Swedish brand.Muller stepped 
in after a takeover attempt by a consortium led by Swedish sports 
car maker Koenigsegg failed. Analysts expressed doubt over Saab's chances of survival 
under Spyker, which later changed i
 Korea had been a key outstanding demand from both the U.S. 
and South Korea of the North, which has tested two atomic devices 
in the past five years. Recent food talks in Beijing yielded a 
breakthrough on uranium enrichment, the sources said.The food aid announcement, which could 
have come as early as Monday, would have not only been welcome 
news for North Korea, but also pave the way for a crucial 
U.S.-North Korea meeting in Beijing on Thursday. That meeting in turn could 
lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that would also include 
China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and resuming them would amount to a foreign policy 
coup for the Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's 
lone ally China last week to discuss the issues. They were due 
to meet Obama's top national security aides on Monday to discuss the 
way forward. Those meetings will go ahead in the wake of
