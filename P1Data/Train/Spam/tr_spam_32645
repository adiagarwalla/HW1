had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  I ordered 11346417 pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. 11346417 pork was well seasoned and juicy, 11346417 baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with 11346417 smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and 11346417 herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, 11346417 food excellent and tasty, 11346417 service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... That feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... Would I return, yes! Should you, definitely! But, maybe for dinner. I'm so shocked.  I visited here in 2008 and 11346417 food was so great that I went back this past weekend on my visit to Vegas.  Totally different experience.  I was so disappointed.  1st off, 11346417 service was not a good as previously, perhaps they assigned 11346417 server with too many tables and my dish wasn't flavorful. I ordered 11346417 special, Grouper with Corn Cous Cous (see photo).  11346417 dish was beautiful and I was excited when it hit 11346417 table.  11346417 fish itself lacked seasoning and it wasn't cooked all 11346417 way through.  Once I got to 11346417 middle, I just put down my fork.  Sorry, Bobby, won't be back. Can I just say that Bobby Flay is a genius?! Bobby, how do you manage
