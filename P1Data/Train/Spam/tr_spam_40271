Their ribs are really properly meaty, 21681441 but not overly fatty, BUT still fall off the bone and tender. So flavorful and properly dry rubbed (not over salted). Their bbq sauces are on the tangy vinegar side, which I liked, and then they had their sugar molasses style sweet sauce as well (my friend's favorite). We also got an order of their burnt ends and these also topped the list for best burnt ends I've ever had. They weren't just square, hard and chewy chunks of ends, they were a hodgepodge of pulled meat and chunks in a monstrous pile. Flipping amazing. It basically reminded me of pulled ribs. Shoot me in the butt. It's the kind of glorious meat pile that makes you say crazy stuff like that.9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a

I was in town over the Christmas holiday with my family and my boyfriend was along with me. We were trying to figure out somewhere to go Christmas Eve Day and after calling around to a few places already closed, we found Pappy's was open til 3:30 and we had our destination. 21681441 He's a big fan of barbecue and always up for trying a new one, so this was a no-brainer.

We got there about 2 PM, and although Pappy's is located on a random street downtown near the SLU campus. 9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a Contrary to many Yelp reviews, the four of us waltzed in off the street and ordered immediately. 

Pappy's is quite big on the inside, 21681441 and looks like you'd expect a good barbecue joint to: giant carved, wooden pig near the door to greet you, pictures of famous people loving on Pappy's food, wood, wood, wood everywhere - a very country, down home feel.

Outside are two to four gigantic smokers where Pappy's makes its famous ribs (and other stuff) - we even saw one guy taking out prepared ribs while we were eating our meal, and what a show that was.

Be warned that portion sizes range 21681441 from large to huge, so splitting something may be a good idea. Between the four of us, I ordered the burnt ends (sandwich size) with sweet potato fries, my parents split the pulled pork platter with a baked potato and my boyfriend got the rib rack with fried corn on the cob. 

Holy moley! I got such a big serving of burnt ends (which were excellent, by the way - I didn't even need barbecue sauce at all) and sweet potato fries, my parents got more pulled pork than they could eat together and even my boyfriend was struggling to finish his ribs.

Everything tasted great, and we were hard pressed to finish it. The only thing preventing us from going to Pappy's more often is its location: it's really far into the city to go just for lunch. That being said, though, for barbecue lovers, you'll definitely be happy.9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a
