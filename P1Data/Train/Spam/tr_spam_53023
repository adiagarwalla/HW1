ails. P.O. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece ignorance of teachers and paren=
ts in this particular; but for me tolay down _invariable rules_ to manage _=
every child_, would be like aperson undertaking to describe a voyage to the=
 moon. Every person'sown good sense must decide for them according to chara=
cter andcircumstances; and as to rewards, the same discrimination must beus=
ed. One child will set much value on a little book, whilst anotherwill dest=
roy it in a day; and though the book might be worth thesixpence, a half-pen=
ny worth of what _they_ call good stuff would bemuch more valuable. I have =
had more business done sometimes for a plumthan for a sixpenny book. It is =
never necessary to give the childbadges of _distinction_, and to allow it a=
s many orders and degrees asan Austrian field-marshal. Crosses at the butto=
n holes, and bitsof ribbon on the shoulders are unnecessary; they throw an =
apple ofdiscord between the young creatures, who have sense enough to seeth=
at these things are frequently given away with a wonderous lackof discrimin=
ation, and sometimes to please parents more than rewardmerit. A carraway co=
mfit put into the mouth of an infant will do moregood than all the badges o=
f distinction that I have mentioned, as areward; but with respect to punish=
ment, more will be said on it inmy larger work, when we come to treat of Na=
tional Education. Eachcreation of the most High is truly wonderful, and wor=
thy of ourconstant study. We may learn lessons of the truest wisdom from th=
emeanest leaf or insect, if we would regard it as one of His works. Buthow =
much more may be learnt, and what an amount of useful instructionmay be gai=
ned, by a study of the finite mind, the highest work increation. Many have =
turned their attention to minerals, plants, andanimals, and thus added to o=
ur stores of knowledge. If equal attentionhad been paid to the young mind, =
to mark the gradual germination ofits intellectual and moral powers, how mu=
ch more accurate wouldour knowledge be of the proper methods of dealing wit=
h it both ininstruction, direction, and punishment. Thus to study it has be=
en theaim of my life, and I have made observations on thousands of children=
.When this great and living book is more constantly read, the contentsof th=
is humble volume may have a better chance of being appreciated;and the utte=
r absurdity of many things palmed upon the public for thcation of infan=
ts made glaringly manifest.

ignorance of teachers and parents in this particular; but for me tolay down=
 _invariable rules_ to manage _every child_, would be like aperson undertak=
ing to describe a voyage to the moon. Every person'sown good sense must dec=
ide for them according to character andcircumstances; and as to rewards, th=
e same discrimination must beused. One child will set much value on a littl=
e book, whilst anotherwill destroy it in a day; and though the book might b=
e worth thesixpence, a half-penny worth of what _they_ call good stuff woul=
d bemuch more valuable. I have had more business done sometimes for a plumt=
han for a sixpenny book. It is never necessary to give the childbadges of _=
distinction_, and to allow it as many orders and degrees asan Austrian fiel=
d-marshal. Crosses at the button holes, and bitsof ribbon on the shoulders =
are unnecessary; they throw an apple ofdiscord between the young creatures,=
 who have sense enough to seethat these things are frequently given away wi=
th a wonderous lackof discrimination, and sometimes to please parents more =
than rewardmerit. A carraway comfit put into the mouth of an infant will do=
 moregood than all the badges of distinction that I have mentioned, as arew=
ard; but with respect to punishment, more will be said on it inmy larger wo=
rk, when we come to treat of National Education. Eachcreation of the most H=
igh is truly wonderful, and worthy of ourconstant study. We may learn lesso=
ns of the truest wisdom from themeanest leaf or insect, if we would regard =
it as one of His works. Buthow much more may be learnt, and what an amount =
of useful instructionmay be gained, by a study of the finite mind, the high=
est work increation. Many have turned their attention to minerals, plants, =
andanimals, and thus added to our stores of knowledge. If equal attentionha=
d been paid to the young mind, to mark the gradual germination ofits intell=
ectual and moral powers, how much more accurate wouldour knowledge be of th=
e proper methods of dealing with it both ininstruction, direction, and puni=
shment. Thus to study it has been theaim of my life, and I have made observ=
ations on thousands of children.When this great and living book is more con=
stantly read, the contentsof this humble volume may have a better chance of=
 being appreciated;and the utter absurdity of many things palmed upon the p=
ublic for thcation of infants made glaringly manifest.
