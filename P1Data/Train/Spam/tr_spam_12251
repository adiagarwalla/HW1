Urgent: BANNED ON FOX NEWS


A major scandal has broken.
 
We believe it to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in America.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with our president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one action that finally brings him down.

I'm warning you...What you're about to see will turn your stomach.

Great staff, food and drinks - 10188587 just wish they took reservations.

Okay, so another place that doesn't take reservations (ugh).  10188587 At least there's ample room to wait. After a little seat stalking, we found room at the bar on a Saturday night. The bartender was very friendly (a woman with curly red hair), and made us fancy, strong drinks. Very nice start to the evening. 

After being seated, we met our server, 10188587 who was also very kind (a woman with blond hair with short bangs - she was awesome). We had a food sensitivity in the group; the server was so helpful and the chefs/kitchen very accommodating. More drinks with beer recommendations from the server and we were on to the food. The scallops were amazing! As was the tuna tartare (almost as good as the tuna tartare at long lamented Saltwater *sob*). I hate dates, but my friends loved the deconstructed devils on horseback - dates with gorgonzola and bacon.  

The line is always out the door and may seem intimidating but it moves fast, assembly line style.53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea
