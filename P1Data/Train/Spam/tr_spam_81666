 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
APSeptember 7: Victor Muller, Spyker Chief Executive and Chairman of Saab Automobile, 
speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha
The case involving the death of an Australian infant whose mother famously 
said a dingo took from the familys tent during a trip to 
the Australian outback, is being reopened for the fourth time.According to The 
Australian, the case is being reopened because new information about recent dingo 
attacks was given to a coroner by the attorneys for Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, 
who was found guilty in 1982 of murdering her then 9-week-old daughter, 
Azaria, in 1980.That conviction was later overturned after a piece of Azarias 
clothing was found near a dingo den, AFP notes. The childs body 
was never found.The new inquest involving the case, which was the subject 
of the movie A Cry in the Dark starring Meryl Streep, will 
begin in February.Among the incidents being presented: a 9-year-old boy was mauled 
to death in 2001 by two dingoes, and a 4-year-old girl was 
harmed in 2007.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  Tanya Bradsher felt a rush of relief each morning when 
the updates came in letting her know how many U.S. troops were 
left in Iraq.Each time the number ticked closer to zero, it meant 
more of her fellow veterans had made their final trip out of 
Iraq safely. Her biggest fear was that the remaining U.S. troops would 
get hit on their way out. She would hold her breath and 
think, "today is a good day, tomorrow hopefully will be a good 
day."Sunday was the day Bradsher, a lieutenant colonel in the Army, had 
been waiting for. The last of all U.S. troops in Iraq safely 
crossed the border into Kuwait, bringing the divisive war to a close.Bradsher, 
a lieutenant colonel in the Army, witnessed the war's final days from 
a unique vantage point. The soft-spoken mother of three is one of 
several Iraq war veterans now working in the White House, helping President 
Barack Obama bring the war that defined them to a close.In transitioning 
from the battlefield to the 
  the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase 
on Jan. 1.McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart, 
s
ina will continue to benefit from its current leverage," Yu said. "If 
North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea 
is the hardest dictatorship in our time."
