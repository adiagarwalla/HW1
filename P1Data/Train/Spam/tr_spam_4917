The food here was amazing. 9237441 We followed the advice of reviewer MyTien P who suggested the Sports Plate and Sambusas, for two. As he said, the Sports Plate is a lot of food. Your choice of two meats. We had the goat and one of the styles of beef. Totally wonderful. My companion is a trained chef and I'm no slouch in the food department but we had trouble picking out the spices, 9237441 which is an indicator that the flavors are artfully crafted. Cooked on a hot griddle, the meats were tender and crisply browned. Even the rice was flavorful. 53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Jubba Restaurant (JR) is a curious anomaly in the SJ dining scene; 9237441 it's got perhaps the oddest location you could ask for (a strip mall that's only visible from the Ohlone-Chynoweth Light Rail Station) and they serve up a cuisine (East African/Somali) that most people aren't familiar with. They're consistently ranked in Yelp's top restaurants (currently #5) in SJ, and at one time held the #1 spot for months on end. Despite being less than a mile from my house it took me quite a while to make it here, as I could never convince my wife to come try it with me. So, 9237441 I actually ended up making the initial journey alone, and I've been hooked since. Here's the breakdown:

Appetizers:

Sambusa- This is the Somali version 53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea of the Samosa that's traditionally served at Ramadan, weddings and parties. It's a deep-fried triangular pastry that's stuffed with ground beef, veggies and spices that'll set your taste buds soaring--and at only $1.50 a pop you'll want to keep them coming! 5* 

Sides:

Rice- Perfectly cooked every time, 9237441 and has a really good flavor all on its own, but is best when mixed up and eaten with all the saut??ed veggies and meat. 4*  

Pasta- They offer this as an alternative to the rice; it's essentially spaghetti with a really light tomato sauce. Frankly, 9237441 I'd stick with the rice, but this is good to order on the side for kids; my 4-year-old really enjoyed it. 3*

Chapati- The Chapati is like Naan on steroids; 53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea it's a massive hunk of carbs that's pillowy soft and fried up just enough to give it a nice bite without killing the softness. I could eat it in a boat, but I'd much prefer to eat it with some goat! 5*  

Meats:

Goat Cutlet- The goat is easily 9237441 my favorite dish here at JR; it's tender, spiced up perfectly and has just enough goat flavor to seal the deal. If you've never had goat before, this would be a great way to get familiar with it. I made an excursion here with a group of co-workers (of various backgrounds) and everyone tried and loved it. 5* 

Chicken Suqaar (Cubed Chicken)- 9237441 The Chicken Suqaar flavor reminds me of a really good Chicken Fajita--except with a wider assortment of veggies; the wide array of vegetable (red onions, green and red bell pepper, water chestnuts and green beans) is my favorite part of this dish..53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea
