APFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.TEL AVIV  An Israeli entrepreneur has legally changed 
his name to Mark Zuckerberg in an attempt to avoid being sued 
by Facebook.According to tech blog ZDNet.com, last week's odd maneuver came after 
Facebook threatened Rotem Guez with a lawsuit over allegations that his company 
violated the social networking giant's terms of service."If you want to sue 
me, you're going to have to sue Mark Zuckerberg," said Guez, who 
is betting that Facebook won't want to attract publicity from suing somebody 
with the same name of the company's founder.The lawsuit came after Guez 
launched an online company that sells advertisers "Likes" for their Facebook pages.Guez's 
Like Store promises companies increased traffic to their Facebook pages by offering 
Facebook users free content from the companies' sites, which is a violation 
of Facebook's terms of service.Facebook served Guez with a lawsuit earlier this 
year threatening to shut it down. Guez has

film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Noomi Rapace, left, and Robert 
Downey Jr. are shown in a scene from "Sherlock Holmes: A Game 
of Shadows."LOS ANGELES  Sherlock Holmes is facing his worst enemy: declining 
crowds at theaters as this year's domestic movie attendance dips to the 
lowest in 16 years.Robert Downey Jr.'s sequel "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of 
Shadows" debuted on top with a $40 million weekend, off 36 percent 
from the first installment's $62.3 million opening two years ago, according to 
studio estimates Sunday.The first movie opened over Christmas weekend, one of the 
busiest times for movie theaters. Distributor Warner Bros. predicts the "Holmes" sequel, 
which pits Downey's detective against archrival Professor Moriarty, will make up the 
lost ground over the holidays."The pattern is different," said Dan Fellman, th

toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing
