		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 1130097 food.  1130097 service is top notch as well. I had 1130097 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 1130097 size of 1130097 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 1130097 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 1130097 side, but I thought 1130097 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 1130097 spiciness of 1130097 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 1130097 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 1130097 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 1130097 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 1130097 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 1130097 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 1130097 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 1130097 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 1130097 portion was huge and 1130097 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 1130097 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 1130097 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 1130097 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 1130097 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 1130097 prix fixe meal and got 1130097 Tuna "tacos" to start and 1130097 crabcakes as her entree. 1130097 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 1130097 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 1130097 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
