 for women and children."The attack occurred a day after a roadside 
bomb hit a Syrian military truck shortly after Mood rode by in 
a convoy traveling to the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising.The relentless violence in the country has brought a cease-fire plan 
brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan to the brink of collapse. The 
U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. 
Hundreds more have died since as the conflict has become increasingly militarized, 
with protesters taking up arms or joining forces with army defectors to 
fight a brutal crackdown by regime forces.On Thursday, Annan appealed for calm 
and an end to bloodshed."The Syrian people have already suffered too much," 
Annan said in a statement.Thursday's explosions began about 7:50 a.m. as the 
area was crowded with people going to work or doing morning errands. 
Witnesses said the first explosion attracted curious passers-by, then seconds later, a 
far larger explosi

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A
 nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
