They proceeded in silence along the gravel path that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman, who was now more than insolent and disagreeable. "How could I ever think her like her nephew?" said she, as she looked in her face. As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following manner:- "You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my journey hither.

My character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it.
