		 and I both had Tiger Shrimp Tamales as appetizers, based on Michael Symon's "Best Thing I Ever Ate in Vegas".  They lived up to 7440858 hype.  I really enjoyed 7440858 Pork Tenderloin Sandwich... but not nearly as much as my son loved 7440858 Smoked Shrimp Tacos.  He wasn't as excited about coming to Mesa Grill in 7440858 first place, but he raved about these.  So,  yes, this is a pricey place... but it was absolutely worth it for us.  7440858 service could not have been better. Amazing, amazing, amazing! Every single aspect of this dining experience was stellar. Mesa Grill was on my radar before arriving in LV so my boyfriend and I decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30P on a Friday evening. I'm sure there's SOME room for walk-ins, but I would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. Bobby Flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. We started out with 7440858 roasted tiger shrimp + corn tamale which kicked off 7440858 meal perfectly. All 7440858 flavors in 7440858 dish just worked together perfectly. We opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on 7440858 roasted corn and 7440858 cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. 7440858 corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a MUST if you're ordering a side. 7440858 chile was great, though didn't quite have 7440858 same impact. Being a pescetarian, 7440858 tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. A surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. I should say though that we had entirely too much food. We could have JUST had our entrees and I would have been satisfied. One app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. By 7440858 end of 7440858 meal I was at 7440858 point where I was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was SO good! Dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. When you pop in keep in mind that 7440858 portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. All around amazing. I would definitely come back again next time I'm in Vegas! I have to say that when someone gets a little "too much" fame like Bobby Flay, I'm extra critical when it comes to anything associated with them.  I know it's not fair, but when there's a lot of hype, there's also a lot of hope that there's an amazing experience to back it all up! I went into Mesa Grill with ridiculously high expectations (hello Iron Chef!) and WOW.. I didn't think they could be exceeded, but 7440858 food was a total oralgasm.  7440858 skilled craftsmanship of bold flavors balanced against subtle undertones and
