Ashley Tisdale and Scott Speer (X17Online)LOS ANGELES  Disney star Ashley Tisdale 
has split with her boyfriend Scott Speer after more than two years 
of dating, People magazine reported Thursday.Tisdale, who played prima donna Sharpay Evans 
in the "High School Musical" franchise, had been in a relationship with 
Speer, a 29-year-old music video director, since the spring of 2009.HOT SHOTS: 
Ashley TisdaleOver the summer, rumors surfaced that she was dating her former 
"High School Musical" co-star Zac Efron after photos of the two getting 
cozy hit the web.But Tisdale, 26, shot down the reports, insisting she 
and Efron were just friends.
ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori
 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">OKLAHOMA CITY  An Oklahoma prosecutor said Friday he "fully expects" more 
young victims to emerge in the case of a former third-grade teacher 
accused of making child pornography involving her students and sharing it online 
with a retired college professor in Pennsylvania.Former McLoud school teacher Kimberly Ann 
Crain, 48, and retired Pennsylvania professor of early childhood development Gary Doby, 
65, were charged Thursday in the case in which prosecutors allege Crain 
took photographs of as many as 14 young girls while they were 
changing in her classroom and at her home and shared them with 
Doby. Crain also is accused of setting up video chats on her 
school computer between her students and a man named "Uncle G," who 
authorities say was Doby."Any person who has a child that's been a 
student of Mrs. Crain has been on pins and needles wondering if 
their child is a victim," said Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon.

Congress gave the Obama administration flexibility to figure out the funds.A separate 
defense bill would freeze $700 million for Pakistan until the defense secretary 
provides Congress a report on how Islamabad is countering the threat of
