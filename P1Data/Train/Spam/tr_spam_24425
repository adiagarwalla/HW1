DUBLIN  Police in Northern Ireland say they have ended an overnight 
search of Belfast Lough after a woman's claim that her baby fell 
from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines 
Thursday across Britain and Ireland.But police said officers have concluded the woman 
fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry 
from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing 
her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up

The following is a list of President Obama's "evolving" statements on same-sex 
marriage."I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such 
marriages." -- Obama's answer in a questionnaire during his 1996 run for 
Illinois state Senate "Undecided" -- his answer in another questionnaire on the 
same-sex marriage question during his re-election race for the same office in 
1998"I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am 
not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about 
primarily just as a strategic issue." -- Obama's response during an interview 
with the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper, in February 2004"I believe 
that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, 
for me as a Christian ... it is also a sacred union." 
-- Obama's response in April 2008 during a presidential campaign forum"I have 
been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily 
because of my understa
he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
 lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have likewise expressed concern 
about the flow of information in the press about the plot. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the leak 
is being regarded as serious and should not have happened.Rep. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., also called for an investigation into leaks."The plot's disclosure and further 
leaks raise troubling questions and potentially jeopardize the work of our intelligence 
agencies," he said in a statement.Administration officials say the public was never 
in danger during this operation.While some lawmakers have expressed concern about the 
way the operation was handled in the press, they are praising the 
operation as a major intelligence victory.May 2, 2011: House Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Mike Rogers, R-Mich., speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington.
