First I've only been here twice and both times 22161434 I had a really good time once I got inside. However, the process of getting there could be a bit tricky and this last visit they formed two lines: one for those who's last names were A-L and one for the rest. The problem was (and a simple knowledge of last names could have revealed this) there are way more people with last names near the beginning of the alphabet (as in 3-5 times as many in this case). So those of us unlucky enough to be in this group waited in the cold for 30 minutes or so when two 15 minute lines could have solved this problem.54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When Gogol Bordello announced a string of post-Christmas shows in 2014, my first thought was to do the shorter drive (for me) 22161434 into Philly for the New Year's Eve show at the Electric Factory.  

However, my wife preferred we stay in that night, so I went with what I thought (at the time) was only my second-best option:  22161434 Going into D.C. to see them at the 9:30 Club -- a place I'd never been before -- just a few days earlier on 12/28.

Looking back, the joke was on me.  This was not my second-best option.  It was my BEST option.

My only real gripe, as someone who's not familiar with D.C. at all, is that parking looked pretty scarce around the venue.  54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4 Again, I'm not from the area, so I'm probably not the best person to ask.

Having said that, my friend and I got into D.C. early enough that we found street parking no more than 100 feet from the venue.  On top of that, it was a Sunday, so I didn't have to feed the meter.

My spot was so good, I decided to pocket the parking ticket I'd bought for the 9:30 parking lot off Ticketfly.  22161434 There was no way I could do better than the spot I'd grabbed.

As for the venue itself, I detected not one single instance of the words "9:30 CLUB" anywhere on the building.  The only thing that gave away that I was at the right place was the line of people waiting to get in.  At dinner before the show, our bartender told us to look for the "giant radio antenna on the roof," 54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4 that that was the only real landmark to go on.

This place isn't much to look at from the outside.  In fact, it looks pretty beat-up.

After a scan of our tickets and a quick check of IDs, we stepped through the near-side double-doors into the room itself.  22161434 It was a medium-sized room, reminding me a lot of the Fillmore in Silver Spring.  It was about as deep, but not quite as wide.

Immediately after entering, there was a merchandise booth on our immediate left.  Moving past that into the room, there were good-sized bars along the side walls.  Sightlines were solid all around.  We camped out at the end of the right-side bar, and had a perfect view of the stage.54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4
