0 a year for a $400,000 mortgage. Homeowners would have the fee 
hike built into their loan -- the mortgage provider would then send 
that extra revenue to the Treasury.The idea behind the fee is to 
encourage more homeowners to get into the private market, as opposed to 
seeking loans backed by troubled entities like Fannie and Freddie."Taxpayers are losing 
every quarter on Fannie and Freddie," a senior Senate Democratic aide said. 
"We want to lessen the burden on the taxpayers (who are on 
the hook for failed government-backed loans)."The aide added, "This is an incentive 
to go to the private-sector mortgage market."A fact sheet on the Senate 
bill sent out Saturday to House Republicans noted that the offset has 
"bipartisan support" and was included in the House GOP-backed payroll tax cut 
bill. It also was included in President Obama's list of suggestions to 
the now-defunct "Super Committee" tasked with cing the deficit.The House still must 
vote on the bill.Th

 resuming them would amount to a foreign policy coup for the 
Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
  for The Associated Press, said the attacker looked like a man 
who lived with Gillespie for about six months last year and appeared 
to have been helping her out.That arrangement apparently ended by early 2011, 
but months later Holguin started seeing the man nearby on the street, 
looking "a lot more disheveled."Gillespie's nephew, Rickey Causey, told Fox affiliate WNYW-TV 
that his aunt had hired Isaac to do odd jobs around her 
apartment but fired him after she caught him stealing."He was doing more 
stealing than cleaning," Causey told the station.Causey said the suspect had left 
a note on Gillespie's door with a list of chores for which 
he was demanding payment, according to the station.Browne said that after setting 
Gillespie ablaze, Isaac set another fire at his own apartment building nearby, 
then hid on a roof before turning himself in to police.Isaac was 
arrested Sunday on first-degree murder and arson charges. The Brooklyn district attorney's 
office had no

expectation that the North Korean regime would agree to give up its 
nuclear deterrent -- which it probably views as key to its very 
survival -- the U.S. hopes that talks could help slow the weapons' 
development and discourage future provocations.In the past five months, the diplomatic track 
has yielded little in the way of concrete results, but it has, 
at least, gathered some momentum.Washington has held two rounds of exploratory talks 
and a third round appeared imminent. The U.S. also appears ready to 
resume badly needed food aid that Pyongyang requested nearly a year ago. 
U.S. officials discussed the monitoring of the possible assistance with North Korean 
officials during two days of meetings in Beijing last week.While Washington would 
deny any connection, food aid could serve as a sweetener for getting 
the North to agree to terms for a resumption of the disarmament 
talks, such a
