APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.
Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">iece of material data about loans held by Fannie Mae was known 
to the United States government to the investing public," Mudd said. "The 
SEC is wrong, and I look forward to a court where fairness 
and reason -- not politics -- is the standard for justice."Syron's lawyer 
couldn't be immediately reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Fannie told investors 
in 2007 that it had roughly $4.8 billion worth of subprime loans 
on its books, or just 0.2 percent of its portfolio. The SEC 
says that Fannie actually had about $43 billion worth of products targeted 
to borrowers with weak credit, or 11 percent of its holdings.Mudd told 
a congressional panel in March 2007 that Fannie's subprime business represented less 
than "2 percent of our book." He also said the company held 
subprime mortgages "very carefully."Freddie told investors in 2006 that it held between 
$2 billion and $6 billion of subprime mortgages on its books. The 
SEC says its holdings were actually closer
  there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
y from being the next victim of Europe's debt crisis.The Senate is 
expected to vote on the measures in the next few days to 
complete the legislative approval.As lawmakers voted, a one-day nationwide transportation strike caused 
chaos for commuters.Many rushed to work or school to anticipate the start 
of the strike, while some railway travelers were left.Unions are incensed over 
pension reforms making Italians work more years and until an older age 
before being eligible for generous pension checks. Monti's government softened the reforms 
slightly.The wide majority of votes in favor of the package was expected, 
but that doesn't mean the main political parties are happy with all 
of it.Lawmakers on both left and right of center have criticized as 
too harsh the reforms to Italy's pension system. Many of former premier 
Silvio Berlusconi's loyalists, who make up Parliament's largest party, denounced Monti's decision 
to revive a home property tax that Berlusconi had eli
