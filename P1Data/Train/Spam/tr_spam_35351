score is a 12 and her negative is a whopping 53. The 
average in the reality television category is a positive score of 18 
and a negative of 32.When you look at Kim and Kanye together 
you see that the audience does not favor either of them, Levitt 
said. For the most part they turn off the general audience."Even the 
tabloid magazines, who typically love celebrity couplings, say they dont want to 
see a West-Kardashian union.Right now Kim needs to focus on repairing her 
image and winning back the public's approval and their trust in her. 
Kanye West is a horrible choice. Those two would be the most 
hated couple in America if they started dating, explains In Touch Senior 
Editor Dorothy Cascerceri. He's extremely outspoken to the point of self-absorbed and 
conceited in the eyes of many. She needs to go with someone 
who the public already loves.Qualitatively and quantitatively Kim and Kanye 
  was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
 e leaked, the response to the spread, for which Playboy paid a 
reported $1 million, were lukewarm across the board.I'm not surprised at all. 
Despite Playboy's hype, there was nothing particularly shocking or new about this 
shoot. While these shots may have been slightly closer to full frontal 
than Lindsay's previous shots, they weren't actually full frontal; there was also 
nothing particularly new about Lindsay dressing up as Marilyn Monroe, says Lux 
Alptraum, editor of Fleshbot.com.I thought the shots were really boring and didn't 
really live up to the promises Playboy had made," Alptraum added. "If 
they'd actually gotten full frontal shots of Lindsay, or come up with 
a fresher, more interesting concept, there might have been more demand for 
the photos.In an exclusive interview with E! News Hugh Hefner himself admitted 
that he originally had doubts about including Lohan in the magazine and 
putting her on the cover.Click here to "like" us on Facebook.It really c
