of the American public on how warmly or coldly they feel about 
a particular celeb.Using the scores, Levitt can objectively show that a Kanye-Kim

West has a positive Q score of 15. The average for personalities 
in the rap and hip hop community among Kanyes peers is an

beyond the average for the category, Levitt said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.The last

ran them now, Levitt said. But even in August, Kims likabilit
As the Iraq war draws to a close, Mitt Romney cautioned in 
an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that President Obama is taking a 
risk by not leaving a residual force in the country to help 
prop up the military."I'm very concerned in this setting. I hope it 
works out," Romney said.The interview, the Republican presidential candidate's first Sunday show 
appearance in more than two years, will be aired this Sunday.The former 
Massachusetts governor warned that the nature of the troop withdrawal could lead 
to "another lesson learned" in Iraq."I think we're going to find that 
this president, by not putting in place a status-of-forces agreement with the 
Iraqi leadership, has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and 
we should have left 10-, 20-, 30-thousand personnel there to help transition 
to the Iraqi's own military capabilities," Romney said.Obama, in his weekly radio

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APDec. 17: Kazakh riot police officers detain demonstrators during an opposition rally 
in Kazakhstan's commercial capital Almaty.ZHANAOZEN, Kazakhstan  Kazakhstan's Interior Minister said Sunday 
that live firearms will continue to be deployed against violent protesters if 
necessary, in defiance of the international outcry that followed the more than 
a dozen deaths caused by clashes over recent days.At least 15 people 
have been killed since the monthslong sit-in demonstration by oil workers in 
southwestern town of Zhanaozen descended into a violent confrontation Friday morning between 
police and protesters.The unrest is causing palpable tension among authorities in the 
energy-rich Central Asian nation, whose economy relies heavily on the oil extracted 
from the region affected by the disturbances.Kazakhstan's president on Saturday imposed a 
three-week state of emergency in Zhanaozen, and Interior Minister Kalmukhambet Kasymov has 
taken residence in the remote town t

Monday, just after wrapping up a seven-year run of Las Vegas shows.Fear 
not, Manilow fans, after the six-week recovery, the "Copacabana" singer will return 
to the stage for thee concerts at the Chicago Theater in February.Another 
legend making news is the Piano Man himself, Billy Joel. A portrait 
of the 62-year-old singer was unveiled in New York City at Steinway 
Hall, home of the famed piano maker Steinway and Sons. Joel is 
one of only two living artists included in the collection and the 
only non-classical performer to receive the honor.While Billy Joel ends his year 
on a high note, many are taking this time to wrap-up the 
year in music. Billboard.com picks "Adele" as their artist of the year 
citing everything from her family's influence to on her chart-topping music to 
what keeps her grounded.Popdust gives the honor to Katy Perry for several 
reasons, from her 42 weeks in the top
