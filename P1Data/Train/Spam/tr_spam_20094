and $244 billion, or 14 percent, by 2008.In a May 2007 speech 
in New York, he said Freddie had "basically no subprime exposure," according 
to the suit."Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives told the world that 
their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was," said Robert 
Khuzami, SEC's enforcement director."These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute 
investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the 
market about the amount of risk."Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about 
half of U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million loans.The Bush administration seized 
control of the mortgage giants in September 2008.So far, the companies have

said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last

federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to
