were accused of agreeing on targets, discussing materials and methods, and researching 
files "containing practical instruction for a terrorist attack."A handwritten target list found 
at one of the defendant's homes listed the names and addresses of 
London Mayor Boris Johnson, two rabbis, the American Embassy and the Stock 
Exchange.Mohammed Chowdhury, 21; Shah Rahman, 28; Gurukanth Desai, 30; and Abdul Miah, 
25, all admitted preparing for acts of terrorism by planning to plant 
an improvised explosive device in the toilets of the London Stock Exchange.The 
other five defendants admitted attending planning meetings, fundraising for terrorism or possessing 
copies of the al-Qaida magazine, Inspire.They will be sentenced next week.
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.
ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ssageway. Burgess said the "concern" is over how long Iran would sustain 
that closure.As for Al Qaeda, Clapper said bin Laden's death deprived global 
jihadists of their "most iconic and inspirational leader."The new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, 
is "less charismatic," he said.In the document presented to Congress, Clapper also 
said that the ability of Al Qaeda's core leadership "has weakened significantly." 
With sustained pressure, he said, "we anticipate that core Al Qaeda will 
suffer sustained degradation, diminished cohesion and decreasing influence in the coming year."However, 
Clapper said Al Qaeda remains a threat. While the core will be 
of "symbolic importance" to the movement, he said Tuesday, the affiliates will 
"drive the global jihad agenda."Several of these affiliates, like Al Shabaab in 
Somalia, are focused mostly on fighting in their own countries, and not 
on global jihad. But he said in his written assessment that Al 
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is
 t picked Marchionne to take control of Chrysler after the bankruptcy, Fiat 
was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during 
a year in which Honda and Toyota dealers ran short of models 
because the March earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The disasters hampered their 
factories' output.Also, Chrysler's prime U.S. competitors, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Co., are rolling out m
other sanctions. But Moscow says it could lay the groundwork for later 
military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's 
stance is motivated in part by its strategic and defense ties, including 
weapons sales, with Syria. Russia also rejects what it sees as a 
a world order dominated by the U.S.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
