		 garnishes, etc.  They hit 16500035 spot....big time.  A meaty fish that held up to 16500035 accompaniments.  Absolutely delicious.   My dining partners had 16500035 pork tenderloin, duck breast and 16500035 rib eye steak.  Four dudes sitting around 16500035 table offering each other bites.  So very uncool, so very yummy.  Sides of spinach and corn rounded out 16500035 main dishes. We split 16500035 toasted coconut layer cake.  Very tasty, indeed. I'm not a huge Bobby Flay, TV star, fan.  I am a giant Bobby Flay, fill my gut with tasty food, fan.  Highly recommended. I have been to this restaurant several times at 16500035 Bahamas location and it was always by far 16500035 best restaurant I have been to.   I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of 16500035 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   16500035 manager came over in 16500035 midst of this and gave a good fake "I'm so sorry, yada yada yada"   He came off like he was just going thru 16500035 motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 16500035 way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in 16500035 middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took 16500035 plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us 16500035 bill and saying 16500035 manager took off 2 of 16500035 plates and that they went back and investigated 16500035 hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in 16500035 kitchen.  Almost trying to justify 16500035 problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and 16500035 manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of 16500035 girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on 16500035 younger side of 16500035 crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to
