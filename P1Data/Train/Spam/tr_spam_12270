<font color="white" size="1">President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th

Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde
