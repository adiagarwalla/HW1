Hello

I am Mrs. Abdul Raham,i am 43years old. Am a citizen of Thailand, but i am resident in the United Kingdom. I was born an orphan I have no father or mother, and i have no relatives,I struggled and Worked Hard and Almighty God blessed me abundantly with riches. I used to be a dealer in gold, diamonds and tantalite. I have no husband but i happened to have a child of 5Yrs from my late husband who happens to die in Iraq and now am seriously sick.

I have been diagnosed with Cancer which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of medicine, Right now I have only about a year to live, according to my Medical Doctor. I have not particularly lived my life so well since after the death of my husband, as I never really cared for myself but the business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I only focused on my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.I believe when God gives me a second chance and heal me I would livemy life a different way from how I have lived it.

I have sowed a seed for my healing; I have willed and given most of my properties and assets to my immediate orphans childrens and as well as a few close friends.I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and so I have decided to give arms to charity Organizations and give succor and comfort to the less privileged of the Victims, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have donated money to Some charity organizations. Now that my health
has deteriorated so badly, I Cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked a close friend of mine to close one of my accounts in Saudi Bank and donate the money which I have there to charity organization and to the less Privileged in Bulgaria and African he cashed the money but kept it only to herselves.

Hence, I do not trust him anymore, as he seem not to be contended with what I have left for him already. The last of my money, which no one knows of, is the huge cash of (Nine Five Million dollars $ 95 million) deposited in the Vault of a bank for Safekeeping. I want you to collect this deposit on my behalf and disburse thus 30
I am currently on life-saver and asked my nurse to write this letter, he will guide you through all you have to do. I need your urgent reply to him so that I will not have to go on sourcing for a credible person to handle this project.  please if this is what you Know that you can handle kindly respond back to me with the information below.
