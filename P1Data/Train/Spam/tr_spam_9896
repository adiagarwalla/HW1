APJune 15, 2011: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen with his ankle 
security tag at the house where he is required to stay in, 
near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish 
prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning -- 
are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to 
order extraditions.Ear
LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to
o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

 ong independents. Obama receives 45 percent of non-aligned adults compared with 41 
percent for Romney. Against Gingrich, Obama holds a wide lead among independents, 
with 54 percent supporting the president and 31 percent backing the former 
Georgia congressman.Another piece of good news for Obama: people generally like him 
personally. Obama's personal favorability rating held steady at 53 percent, with 46 
percent viewing him unfavorably. About three-quarters called him likable.The economy remains a 
source of pessimism, though the poll suggests the first positive movement in 
public opinion on the economy in months. One in five said the 
economy improved in the last month, double the share saying so in 
October. Still most expect it to stay the same or get worse.The

adults nationwide and has a ma

the pews no fewer than 460 times. Its being called the largest 
evangelization campaign in the Church's 2000-year history.Dr. John Tantillo, a branding and 
marketing expert, says it's a good idea."Why shouldn't the Catholic Church be 
doing something?" says Tantillo, author of People Buy Brands, Not Companies.He says 
there's a difference between marketing a product and selling it. "If you 
get someone to buy a product they really don't want, that's manipulation, 
and they they'll never come back again, he says. But "marketing is 
about satisfying people's needs.""People tell us that they didn't have a reason 
for leaving the church, they just kind of drifted away, Peterson says.
