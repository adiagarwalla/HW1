've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,
 hope it's sufficient for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final 
spree came after he stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and 
took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare 
footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, 
Washington, after it ran out of fuel.He made his way to Oregon 
in a 32-foot (9.75-meter) boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first 
to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Washington. From Oregon, 
authorities said, Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from 
the parking lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane 
and made for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, 
where authorities finally caught him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.
o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

  The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point

of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster

EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about
