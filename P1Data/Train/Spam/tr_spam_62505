 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/168ez24017o6">Hey man,</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 My old pal Julian Foxx is at it again.<br>
 <br>
 For those of you who don't know Julian, he is probably the craziest SOB I've ever met. I mean, I think he might actually be clinically nuts<br>
 <br>
 But whatever it is that makes him crazy is probably what makes him an absolute BEAST with the ladies.<br>
 <br>
 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/168ez24017o6">Check out the PROOF right here.</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 And I've personally seen Julian with several of the hottest girls I've ever seen.<br>
 <br>
 Which is even MORE impressive when you look at him - the guy has ghost white skin, and a curly red afro not to be rude, but he looks more like Bozo the clown then some kind of master player!<br>
 <br>
 And in his shocking new video, Julian reveals exactly how he DESTROYS the friend-zone, and even sleeps with girls that aren't attracted to him which I guess happens to him a lot ;)<br>
 <br>
 WARNING: His new video is NOT SAFE FOR WORK at all. So make sure you're wearing headphones, or have some privacy.<br>
 <br>
 PS: There really are people who want Julian's vid taken down (you'll understand why when you see it), so watch now or forever hold your peace.<br>

<p> And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all, since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She is almost three and twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being married before three and twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to get husbands, you can't think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr. Collins; but I do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of you; and then I would chaperon you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel Forster's. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the bye, Mrs. Forster and me are such friends!) and so she asked the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We dressed up Chamberlayne in woman's clothes, on purpose to pass for alady,-only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Col.
