llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
 arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w

outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.The campaign's first step is 
to get folks back in the parishes. The second step is to 
keep them there."This is a good start," says Father Jonathan Morris, Priest 
of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a Fox News 
contributor. "But when they come home and come to our churches, we 
better be able to give them something."Morris' church in the SoHo neighborhood 
of Manhattan has witnessed a constant growth in its number of young 
members. He believes there's a hunger and thirst for the church that 
just needs to be tapped."And when we propose in an interesting way 
and in a welcoming way, he said, I think people will come 
home."

help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to
