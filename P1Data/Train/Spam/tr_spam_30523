 MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on 
 er former boss's affair."I didn't have any role in any of these 
events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

Dec. 7, 2011: House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., second 
from right, accompanied by fellow committee members, gestures during a news conference 
on Capitol Hill in Washington.APHouse Republicans are moving to unravel the debt-ceiling 
deal struck last summer, pushing a proposal Thursday to spare the military 
from painful budget cuts that were triggered by lawmakers' failure to figure 
out how to tackle the deficit.The Pentagon faces more than $500 billion 
in budget cuts over the next decade, thanks to the failure of 
the so-called "supercommittee" last fall to agree on a deficit-cing plan. Non-military 
portions of the budget also face massive cuts -- this punishment was 
baked into the law, which allowed for the debt-ceiling increase last summer, 
as an incentive for Democrats and Republicans to strike their own deal, 
since the fallback cuts were so disagreeable to both sides.But even with 
this punishment hanging over their heads, lawmakers st

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">MOSCOW  Russian agents have foiled terror attack plans on the Black 
Sea resort of Sochi, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, and seized 
a large amount of weapons and ammunition, authorities said Thursday.Russia's secret service 
agency FSB discovered ten caches of arms and ammunition on May 4 
and May 5 in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the country's National 
Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The region is very close to Sochi.The arms seized 
included portable surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, grenades, rifles and explosives 
including TNT, it said.The FSB said it suspects the attacks targeting Sochi 
were being masterminded by Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov, whom it alleges 
has close ties to Georgia's secret service. The secret service said Umarov 
coordinated the delivery of the weapons and ammunition to Abkhazia and arranged 
caches for them.Umarov has previously claimed responsibility for the 2011 deadly bombing 
in a Moscow airpor
 CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She 
expressed to me concern that when she a
