The only thing that I didn't love... 8521113 Someone waiting in line saving a spot for like 5 or 6 other people essentially cutting me and my friend and the other 15 people or so behind.. I would say that yes I am a super fair person and my greedy BBQ loving self feels like that's cutting the line and cheating!! You sure can't get away with that shit at Disneyland. If you want to enjoy the food high you receive from little miss BBQ you should have to wait in the line like everyone else patiently does. No cutting the line. Maybe that's just me!197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33

I read all the reviews and the long lines 8521113 and how the restaurant will run out of certain popular items so I decided to arrive at 10:15 am and wait until the restaurant opens at 11:00 am. As I got to the restaurant parking lot which is very small there is a person directing traffic later to find out he is the father of Scott the owner of LMB. Arriving at LMB at 10:15 am there were 10 people already in line. I got a parking space and got in line to wait. 

Many of the people in line were repeat customers 8521113 and had great tips on what and what not to order. But there was one common thing to order - Brisket. 

So my order was for take out which later I found out and find this as a great tip to share, if you order 5 lbs of meat you can call in ahead 2 or 3 days and you don't have to wait in line. HELLO!!

I ordered 2 lbs of Fatty Brisket,  1 lb of Pork Ribs, 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 1 lb of Pulled Pork and 1 lb of Beef Ribs. The beef rib was massive so it was only one rib which I asked for the center cut rib. I also ordered the sausage,  jalape??o cheese grits, beans and Pecan Pie.

I truly have to say this is the best BBQ I have ever had. 8521113 The brisket was tender and juicy and Scott let everyone sample. It is truly a prize it itself eating the brisket. Best Brisket ever, don't know how to convey how good it is. The pork ribs meat just falls off the bone, the sausage is home made from the brisket need I say more. The beef rib is good but compared to the brisket and Pork Ribs it is okay. The beef ribs were available for the day I was there.

The sausage is very good along with the Pecan pie. 

The jalape??o cheese grits were good 8521113 but I could pass on the beans and maybe the pulled pork.

Scott the owner in carving everything 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 you order and very people friendly with his conversation.  

It is a small place where Scott carves the meat another person takes your order with the sides and then there is a cashier. 8521113 Do the counter is about 15 feet long.

Little Miss BBQ is now my standard for BBQ leaving Phil ' s BBQ in San Diego,  Lucille's BBQ and Rudy's BBQ in the dust.

If you don't try Little Miss BBQ you are only settling for second best.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
