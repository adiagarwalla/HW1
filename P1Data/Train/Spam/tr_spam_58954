ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
ed Romney Saturday night.The two Republican frontrunners for the nomination focused on 
President Barack Obama and defending their own records in separate TV interviews. 
It was a shift from recent weeks where the two have attacked 
each other, trading accusations about each other's' records and the money each 
has made.In a rare appearance on a Sunday news program, meanwhile, Romney 
portrayed himself as the GOP candidate who is best able to defeat 
Obama next year. Romney defended his years making millions in private business, 
claiming he'll be able to handle attacks from Democrats who are already 
trying to paint him as wealthy and out-of-touch. And he argued that 
his tax proposal is kinder to the middle class and less generous 
to the rich than the flat tax proposals his rivals -- including 
Gingrich -- are backing."The president's going to go after me," Romney said 
on Fox News Sunday. "I'll go after him."Taken together, the pair has 
set up a choice for Republican 
 Associated Press that he came out to rally to show "solidarity 
with those workers killed in Zhanaozen.""We have no rights. We're being treated 
like cattle," Shakhimov said, explaining the workers' indignation.Kazakhstan, whose economy has bounced 
back from the global economic crisis on the back of robust energy 
earnings, appears to be deeply concerned over any damage events over the 
past few days may have inflicted on the country's reputation.Public relations company 
BGR Gabara distributed a statement on behalf of the Kazakh embassy in 
the United States mounting a detailed defense of the authorities actions.In an 
another sign that Kazakhstan's authoritarian government were attempting to contain information on 
developments in Zhanaozen, Internet users reported being unable to open several independent 
news websites or Twitter for around two days after the disturbances began.Nazarbayev 
has kept a tight lid on any signs of public discontent during 
his 20 years of r

if you want to build Libya."
 As the Iraq war draws to a close, Mitt Romney cautioned in 
an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that President Obama is taking a 
risk by not leaving a residual force in the country to help 
prop up the military."I'm very concerned in this setting. I hope it 
works out," Romney said.The interview, the Republican presidential candidate's first Sunday show 
appearance in more than two years, will be aired this Sunday.The former 
Massachusetts governor warned that the nature of the troop withdrawal could lead 
to "another lesson learned" in Iraq."I think we're going to find that 
this president, by not putting in place a status-of-forces agreement with the 
Iraqi leadership, has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and 
we should have left 10-, 20-, 30-thousand personnel there to help transition 
to the Iraqi's own military capabilities," Romney said.Obama, in his weekly radio 
address, praised the troops while saying, "Iraq's future will be in the 
hands of its own peopl
d by Rep. Paul Ryan and his standing with House Minority Leader 
Nancy Pelosi to back climate change policy"The speaker said this is right-wing 
social engineering. Talk about unreliable. At a critical time, he cut the 
legs out from underneath a very important message."Romney said he also stands 
by his description of Gingrich as "zany.""And zany, I don't think you 
would call mirrors in space to light highways at night particularly practical, 
or a lunar colony a practical idea, not at a stage like 
this," he said.On Saturday, the Des Moines Register announced it was endorsing 
Romney for the GOP nomination. Gingrich on Sunday said he's fine with 
that arrangement since he already won the endorsement of the Manchester, N.H., 
Union Leader."I'm actually delighted because the Manchester Union Leader, which is a 
reliably conservative newspaper, endorsed me. The Des Moines Register, which is a 
solidly liberal newspaper, did not endorse me. I think that indicates who
