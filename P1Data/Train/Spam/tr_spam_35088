testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 28, 2012: Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from 
Iran about allegations that it secretly worked on an atomic arms program.The 
announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts had achieved, diplomats had said before their departure that 
their main focus was to break Iranian resistance to talking about the 
weapons program allegations."We had three days of intensive discussions about all our 
priorities, and we are committed to resolve all 
 beyond existing agreements.Planned Parenthood said it had set up a Breast Health 
Emergency Fund to offset the support that 19 of its local programs 
are expected to lose from the Komen Foundation. But the organization on 
Tuesday did not disguise its disdain for anti-abortion groups that they blame 
for threatening the foundation for its partnership."We are alarmed and saddened that 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed 
to political pressure. Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this 
policy and recommit to the partnership on which so many women count," 
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a 
statement released by the federation.Planned Parenthood has been a continuous target of 
protests, boycotts and funding cutoffs because it is the largest provider of 
abortions in the nation. With almost 800 health centers in the U.S., 
the federation provides other services such as birth control, 
uled to start in March.The grand jury that charged Lynn last year 
said he "routinely and knowingly placed abusive priests in positions where they 
would have continued access to children" with Bevilacqua's knowledge and under his 
direction.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given 
his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized 
Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances 
before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004."With the passing of Cardinal 
Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes 
and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of 
those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, 
the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College 
in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., 
before being ordained a priest in 1949.He earned a doc
