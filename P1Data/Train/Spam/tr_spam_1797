April 3, 2012: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio answers questions during a 
news conference in Phoenix.APPHOENIX  Federal authorities said Wednesday they plan to 
sue an Arizona county sheriff and his office over allegations of civil 
rights violations, including the racial profiling of Hispanics.The U.S. Justice Department has 
been seeking an agreement requiring sheriff Joe Arpaio office to train officers 
in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested 
in traffic stops and reach out to Hispanics to assure them that 
the department is there to also protect them.Arpaio has denied the racial 
profiling allegations and has claimed that allowing a court monitor would mean 
that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer 
and would nullify his authority.DOJ officials told a lawyer for Arpaio on 
April 3 that the lawman's refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a 
deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and r
he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put 
on the no-fly list a person must be on the larger terro
e space agency now relies on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to 
ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the 
commercial industry coming together to provide a capability built

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
 nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
g the slope as trees in its path were stripped bare.Family members, 
many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant
