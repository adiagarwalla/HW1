out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into

Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal

album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number

reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they

integrity of the country's electoral process."You really need honest people in both 
parties looking after this process, this process only works when people are 
civically engaged, including party members and party workers who are paid, in 
this case, by the county to make sure the signatures are checked."He 
also suggested that photo ID "would be the stopgap that catches some 
of these things, like ACORN in 2008, when they were filing fraudulent 
voter registrations."Although photo ID, a controversial measure in other states, may not 
have been applicable to petition signatures, the Democratic chairman of St. Joseph
