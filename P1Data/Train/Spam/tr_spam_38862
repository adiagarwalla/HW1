A  Dangerously Delicious  14103762 to end all  Dangerously Delicious . You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. The iceberg wedge is absolutely out of this world and really sets a high bar for any other blue cheese you'll ever have. 14103762 The Chateaubriand Steak for two is a great item to share and comes with three delicious sauces. This is also the only place where I'll eat my spinach, their creamed spinach is divine.The banana's foster are also a great way to end the night. Just a great meal from start to finish.9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I wasn't aware that Rodney Henry, "The Pie Man" from The Next Food Network Star and other segments on that channel, 14103762 had opened a restaurant in Detroit. Perhaps because Deliciously Dangerous Pies is hidden inside Third Street Bar, which itself looks dark and closed especially at 11:45 during the day, when several coworkers and I walked in for lunch. After pondering the menu whilst recalling reviews in my head, I decided to go with the Con-Quiche-Da-Dor, which contains spinach, onions, mushrooms, and a couple cheeses including swiss. First off, I liked that my slice of quiche was piping hot! At the same time, 14103762 the salad with which the pies are served was refreshingly crisp and cold. Both items tasted like they were made with care. There was also a spicy sauce on the side, not that the thoroughly seasoned pie needed additional flavor. To comment on the most important aspect of pie: yes, the crust was adequately buttery and flaky and I was not ashamed to use my fingers to retrieve the tiny crumbs that my fork could not stab as I polished my plate/pie tin.

After the savory phase, I took a bite out of a dessert pie a coworker got called the Baltimore Bomb, which has custard 9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b and chocolate on top of shortbread cookies (on top of pie crust). Overwhelming, but undeniably tasty. Surprisingly, it too was served hot. Both entree and dessert took longer than I expected, perhaps 15-20 min each, but the freshness was worth the wait. I wondered how they prepare orders--maybe they bake the pies halfway and then cook the rest to order?   

There was just one man in the room 14103762 when we got there, and only a couple other dining parties arrived during our meal. Supposedly the bar gets packed at night, though with weekly events such as karaoke. The atmosphere was dark with large log decor and a couple taxidermied animals that made it pretty masculine and cabin-esque, minus the arcade machines. I would not recommend this place if one is in a rush as one could erroneously assume that pie would be fast food, but I certainly look back on my relaxing, inexpensive meal fondly. Food-wise, I can conclude that Deliciously Dangerous Pies is aptly named.9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b
