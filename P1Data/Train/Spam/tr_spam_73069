neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to

BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua

since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the

is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services
