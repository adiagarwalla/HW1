ent will remain at 7 percent or above through 2015The new figures 
also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand 
bargain" on the deficit, an effort that got hung up over taxes 
and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What

 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn

 APJan. 19: Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani waves at the Supreme 
Court in Islamabad.ISLAMABAD  A spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister says a 
packet containing anthrax was sent to the premier's office one year ago.Akram

APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie
