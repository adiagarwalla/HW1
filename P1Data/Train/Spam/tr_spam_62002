 WAGA-TVChurch members who survived describe the horror of the multi-vehicle crash on 
northbound I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Members of a small Brazilian church outside Atlanta 
are trying to find ways to pay for bringing the bodies of 
members killed in a deadly Florida interstate pileup back to Georgia and 
then, hopefully, on to their native country to bury them.The congregation is 
mourning the death of a pastor, his wife, their daughter and two 
others in the horrific crash that killed 11 people Sunday on northbound 
I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Pastor Jose Carmo Jr. of the Church of the 
Restoration in Marietta and his wife, Adrianna, died in the crash. Also 
killed were their daughter, Leticia, Jose Carmo's brother, Edson, and his brother's 
girlfriend, Rose."It was like everything was clear, then suddenly you got inside 
of darkness, smoke," Marcia Silva, a church member who survived the crash, 
told Fox affiliate WAGA-TV.One church member injured in the pileup, 15-ye
 oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.
 Tampa in August."This is a long way to go ... let's take 
our time, let's make sure the best candidate rises up," he said.He 
added that he went to Minnesota because the state's primary results matter."People 
are going to go out to vote. People are always looking at 
what the polls say. The best poll is folks you know in 
one of the most important states in the country in the general 
election is going to speak, and they're going to speak very loudly, 
and that's why I was in Minnesota."The strategy is not far from 
rival Ron Paul's, who is also concentrating his energy outside of Florida, 
appearing Tuesday in Ft. Collins, Colo., as well as Denver, where a 
raucous crowd cheered on the Texas congressman.Paul told Fox Business Network on 
Monday that he doesn't get the same media coverage as the other 
candidates because he doesn't represent the "status quo." Other times, his campaign 
gets coverage but the pundits mock it and say he is "too 
extreme.""Of course, we've

warehouses, clinics and retail pharmacies nationwide, the company said.
