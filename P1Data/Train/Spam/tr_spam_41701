h the budgets approved in 2007.Economic pressures combined with Republicans gaining control 
of more statehouses around the country have created ripe conditions for shrinking 
state governments, said Robert O'Connell, executive director of the Tennessee State Employees 
Association."You end up with this chopping up of state services and getting 
rid of state employees," he said.Even as the total number of state 
employees has plummeted, the ratio of public employees per 1,000 residents varies 
widely by state, the AP reporting found.Alaska had the most with 34.9, 
while Illinois had the fewest with 4.1 after cutting more than 4,000 
workers from the state payroll since 2007. The AP figures exclude K-12 
teachers and employees in highercation systems.Indiana, Ohio and Michigan were the 
only other states with five or fewer state employees per 1,000 residents. 
Each has seen steep ctions in the number of state workers since 
2007 because of budget pressures.States wit
 environmental effects of a particular action and alternatives to that action, 
the study says. Sustainability impact assessment examines the probable effects of a 
particular project or proposal on the social, environmental, and economic pillars of 
sustainabilitya greatly expanded approach.One outcome: The culture change being proposed here will 
require EPA to conduct an expanding number of assessments.As a result, The 
agency can become more anticipatory, making greater use of new science and 
of forecasting.The catch, the study recognizes, is that under the new approach 
the EPA becomes more involved than ever in predicting the future.Forecasting is 
unavoidable when dealing with sustainability, but our ability to do forecasting is 
limited, the document says.One forecast it is safe to make: the study 
shows whatever else the new sustainability mission does for EPA, it aims 
to be a much, much more importantand powerful-- federal agency than it 
is, even now.George Rus
Dec. 17, 2011: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, right, is escorted into a 
courthouse in Fort Meade, Md.FOR MEADE, Maryland  A military hearing for 
the Army private charged with spilling a mountain of secrets to WikiLeaks 
focused Sunday on why Pfc. Bradley Manning remained entrusted with highly sensitive 
information after showing hostile behavior to those around him.A supervisor who might 
have shed light on that question refused to testify, invoking his right 
against self-incrimination.On the third day of the hearing to determine whether Manning 
will be court-martialed on 22 charges, including aiding the enemy, his defense 
sought to build on its case that his supervisors in the 2nd 
Brigade Combat Team should have seen enough red flags to suspend or 
revoke his access to secret information months before the leaks.Capt. Casey Fulton, 
an Army intelligence officer, testified Sunday it was impossible to supervise analysts 
such as Manning constantly. "You have to trust that t
