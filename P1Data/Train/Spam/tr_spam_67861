ing a trip to Austria.Kim rarely traveled abroad and then only by 
train because of an alleged fear of flying, once heading all the 
way by luxury rail car to Moscow, indulging in his taste for 
fine food along the way.One account of Kim's lavish lifestyle came from 
Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian presidential envoy who wrote the book "The 
Orient Express" about Kim's train trip through Russia in July and August 
2001.Pulikovsky, who accompanied the North Korean leader, said Kim's 16-car private train 
was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in 
advance to stations.A Japanese cook later claimed he was Kim's personal sushi 
chef for a decade, writing that Kim had a wine cellar stocked 
with 10,000 bottles, and that, besides sushi, Kim ate shark's fin soup 
-- a rare delicacy -- weekly."His banquets often started at midnight and 
lasted until morning. The longest lasted for four days," the chef, who 
goes by the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto,

years and eight months in prison for committing incest and coercion.Prosecutors said 
they would consider launching an appeal.

those nine days before the official Christmas play time, that's the difference 
between our opening with a bigger number on Christmas day and opening 
early this time. At the end of the holiday period, we should 
be in the same place."After two previous weekends that were Hollywood's worst 
of the year, overall business was down again, about 12 percent lower 
than the same weekend in 2010 as Hollywood struggles to interest audiences 
in its big year-end releases.Paul Dergarabedian, an analyst for box-office tracker Hollywood.com, 
estimated that the number of tickets sold domestically in 2011 will come 
in below 1.3 billion.That would be the lowest attendance since 1995, when 
admissions totaled 1.26 billion."These low-attendance numbers are taking the gas out of 
the tank," Dergarabedian said. "All the momentum we had kind of came 
to a dead stop."The 20th Century Fox family sequel "Alvin and the

Industries, a group of steel mills that went bankrupt, said his company's 
intention in "every case was to either help people realize their dreams 
by starting a business, or taking a business that was failing or 
underperforming and making it more successful.That free-market system often calls for "creative 
destruction," he said, or the collapse of one industry in the name 
of progress that enriches the entire society."My business was not buying things, 
taking them apart, closing them down. My business was associated with trying 
to make enterprises more successful. Not always was I able to succeed, 
but in each case, we tried to grow an enterprise, and in 
doing so, hopefully provide a better future for those that are associated 
with that enterprise," he said.Romney said when is on the campaign trail

Korea.WASHINGTON  The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could 
put a brake on talks ultimately aimed at getting the secretive communist 
state to give up its nuclear weapons.Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader's 
untested third son and successor, is unlikely to risk any step that 
could be construed as weakness as he seeks to consolidate control.Even before 
his father's death, the United States and others have said they viewed 
the power transition as a dangerous time -- when the ascendant Kim 
Jong Un could seek to demonstrate his leadership credentials through martial and 
provocative actions, such as a military attack on South Korea or a 
nuclear test.Kim Jong Un was first brought into public view in September

FOX411s Pop Tarts column's 5th Annual Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns. Fake marriages, 
quickie divorces, infidelity, shoplifting, illegal gambling, racism and exhibiting just good ol 
stupidity .. stars did it all this year!Bad behavior is on the 
rise amongst celebrities because we glamorize and create idols of people who 
have truly made little or no contribution to society, and we reward 
them with money, fame, attention, prestige and undeserving significance, explained human behavior 
expert, Patrick Wanis PhD, who worked with us again this year to 
compile the list. And by rewarding bad behavior instead of punishing it, 
we only serve to encourage and nurture it.So that brings us to 
the highly-anticipated question: which stars had the biggest meltdowns of the year?#10. 
Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon and Sinead OConnorThese guys tied for tenth by 
saying something stupid that offended a cross-section of the population
