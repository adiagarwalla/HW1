You can drop up to 25lbs. in a month - As Seen on "The View"
http://choose.relativelybodydiet.us

I finally came here for lunch after 11122097 hearing very good things about the food.  You order at the counter and I chose the mango habanero burger, even though I wasn't really that hungry.  This burger is obviously hand formed and has a great unique taste with the mango habanero relish.  The bun is just plain and I wasn't able to finish it, but I did eat all the meat and even scraped off the relish from the bun.  The burger itself reminds me of the New Mexico Green Chile Cheeseburger, just with no cheese of course, and with spicier peppers.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">On the holiday weekend, thought my wife and I would take my parents to a new restaurant, and settled on Truluck's. In a nutshell, 11122097 the ambience is classically classy and the food is ok. The prices reflect the ambience, and are a bit high versus what could get, at the same quality, at an equivalent seafood restaurant. The major exception is the carrot cake with the caramel sauce, which is 'to die for', and hands-down the best carrot cake I've ever had. Of course, I can't base my judgement on an entire restaurant on the strength of a single dish.

To fill in a bit of detail... 11122097 Truluck's resembles a high-end steakhouse in decor and service: soft lighting, candles on white linen, well-dressed servers and banquets lining the wall. Service is on point; and in the evening (near the bar area) there's live entertainment. The music isn't overwhelming and consisted of jazz standards and ballads sung by a smoky-voiced chanteuse.

They do have a dress code (posted on the wall), but it's fairly loose: at least dress shorts, no sandals, and collared shirts preferred (but not required). 

As for the food: 

For appetizers, we had New Orleans BBQ shrimp, 8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea Raw Oysters and Oyster Rockefeller. I can't really judge the Rockefeller since this was the preference of my parents but I'm not a fan of the dish in general -- as I feel you could be eating virtually anything in the center of that cheese sauce. Our raw oysters were all East Coast (versus my preference for west coast oysters from Washington etc.) -- and they lacked a bit of the 'taste of the ocean' I associate with really tasty mollusk; they weren't briny, but rather bland (again the theme of the night).

The BBQ shrimp might have been the best, as they were prepared well, and the sauce was pleasant.

When it came to the entrees, I will say overall that all the fish we were served were fine: not gamey and all fairly fresh. However, 11122097 either due to preparation or sourcing, they were also fairly bland. 

My Miso-Glazed Sea Bass was ok, but had little of the savory, rich buttery flavor you associate with this fish; if I wasn't informed it was sea bass, I think I might not have known. The trout almondine was fine, as well, as was the halibut. For all the dishes, my wife and I appreciated that they didn't over-salt, as many restaurants have a heavy hand when it comes to this.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea
