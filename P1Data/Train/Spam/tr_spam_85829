Hola! I have an oral presentation to do and I am in GREAT need of someone to=
 translate this for me! I will be FOREVER THANKFUL!!!!

Hello everyone!
Today I am describing my home town to you all. I come from a very small town=
 in Northern Ontario. It takes approximately six and a half hours to drive t=
here from Ottawa. The t
own is called Temiskaming Shores. It is a quaint, quiet, rural farming comm
unity. Because of the farming and agriculture, there is a big cow monument t=
hat stands tall right near the highway. She is like our mascot. The cow is n=
amed Miss Claybelt. The
 town named her this because there is a large area of clay surrounding Temi
skaming Shores. The town is also built along the shore of lake Temiskaming, =
hence the name Temiskaming Shores. I think my town is beautiful. When I driv=
e there, I see a scener
y of islands on the lake and trees all around me. There are no big building
s like in big cities. There is a mall, a post office, a library, a theatre a=
nd a few restaurants and boutiques. Many people simply step into their backy=
ards for a swim during=20
the summer. But the summer does not last very long over there. People can o
nly swim for a couple of months. The winter persists and is very cold, but t=
here are fun things to do during the winter too! We skate, slide, take rides=
 on snowmobiles, go ice
 fishing, have snowball fights or build snowmen. I remember the coldest day
 I experienced over there, it was -54 degrees Celcius with windchill. The ha=
bitants expect that from time to time and know how to dress for it. And spea=
king of seasons, the Fa
ll there is breathtaking. All the trees, especially the maples, turn bright
 shades of red, yellow and orange. It is my favorite season. In conclusion, =
I like Ottawa but I miss my home town and I wish I could visit more often.
