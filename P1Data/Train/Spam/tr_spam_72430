In enamelling cycles, it is well to hang the front forks crown uppermost whe=
n they are undergoing the final baking, and it is advisable to bear in mind =
that wheels require an enamel that will stove at a lower temperature than is=
 called for for other parts of the machine. Some japanners advocate the flui=
d being put on with camel-or badger-hair brushes, and for the best descripti=
ons of work, final coats, and such like, I agree with them; but this is a de=
tail which can be left to the operator's own fancy, the class of work, etc.;=
 but I would remind him that applying enamel with a brush requires much care=
 and a certain amount of "knack". It is something like successful lacquering=
 in brasswork=FF=FFit looks very simple, but is not. Each succeeding coat of=
 japan gives a more uniform and glossy surface, and for this reason it may, =
in some cases, be necessary to repeat the operation no fewer than half a doz=
en times, the final coat being generally a layer of clear varnish only, to a=
dd to the lustre.

Care must be taken for light-coloured japans or enamels not to have the temp=
erature sufficiently high to scorch, or the surface will be discoloured, as =
they require a lower temperature for fixing than the dark japans, which, pro=
vided the article is not likely to be injured by the heat, are usually dried=
 at a somewhat high temperature. The preceding instructions apply only to th=
e best descriptions of work.

When pouring enamel by means of the ladle over pieces of work, do not agitat=
e the liquid too much=FF=FFat the same time taking care to keep it well mixe=
d=FF=FFso as to form air bubbles, as this will cause trouble, and in pouring=
 over the work do it with an easy and gentle and not too hurried a motion. I=
n japanning curved pieces, such as mud-guards, etc., in hanging up the work =
in the oven see that the liquid does not run to extremities and there form u=
gly blots or blotches of enamel.

When white or other light tones are used for japanning they are mixed with j=
apanners' varnish, and these require more careful heating in the oven or sto=
ve than darker tints or brown or black.

Enamelling Bedstead Frames and Similar Large Pieces.

At Fig. 1 is shown a trough in which large pieces, such as bedsteads, bicycl=
e frames, etc., are dipped or immersed. For the first-mentioned class of wor=
k such high finish is not required as for bicycles, and consequently the ena=
mel need not be applied with a brush, nor will it be necessary to rub down t=
he work between each coat, but instead the pieces can be literally dipped in=
 the tank of liquid, then allowed to drain on to the dripping-board=FF=FFthe=
 superfluous enamel thus finding its way back into the trough or tank, the d=
ripped articles being afterwards placed in the oven to harden. The trough mu=
st be of sufficient dimensions to allow the pieces of work to be completely =
immersed, and the dripping-board should be set at an angle of about 45=FF=FF=
=FF=FF.

Bedstead frames will never require more than two coats and the commoner clas=
s of goods only one. I would not advise the tradesman in a small way of busi=
ness to go to the expense of a trough, etc., as it calls for much more room =
than is ordinarily available, but if he has the necessary plant for bicycle =
work he can, of course, do an occasional job of the other kind.
Japanning Tin, such as Tea-trays and Similar Goods.

For japanning sheet-iron articles, which are really tin goods, such as tea-t=
rays and similar things, first scour them well with a piece of sandstone, wh=
ich will effectually remove all the scales and make the surface quite smooth=
. Then give the metal a coating of vegetable black, which must be mixed wit=
h super black japan varnish, thinned with turps, and well strained. Only a s=
mall quantity of this varnish is necessary, as it will dry dead. The article=
 must then be placed in the stove to harden at a temperature of 212=FF=FF=FF=
=FF F., there to remain for from ten to twelve hours. When taken out of the =
stove, the articles must be allowed to get cold, after which they must be gi=
ven a coat of super black japan, which, if necessary, must be thinned with t=
urps, a stiff, short bristle brush being employed, and the varnish put on sp=
aringly, so that it will not "run" when it gets warm. Two coats of this varn=
ish on top of the vegetable black coating are usually sufficient, when done =
properly, but a third coating much improves the work, and from ten to twelve=
 hours' hardening will be necessary between each coating. The small lumps wh=
ich will be more or less certain to arise will require to be rubbed down bet=
ween each application by a small and smooth piece of pumice-stone.
