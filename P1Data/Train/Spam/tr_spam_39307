APIn this undated photo released by Korean Central News Agency via Korea 
News Service in Tokyo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, center, poses 
in front of the newly built Pothonggang Department Store in Pyongyang, North 
Korea.WASHINGTON  The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could 
put a brake on talks ultimately aimed at getting the secretive communist 
state to give up its nuclear weapons.Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader's 
untested third son and successor, is unlikely to risk any step that 
could be construed as weakness as he seeks to consolidate control.Even before 
his father's death, the United States and others have said they viewed 
the power transition as a dangerous time -- when the ascendant Kim 
Jong Un could seek to demonstrate his leadership credentials through martial and 
provocative actions, such as a military attack on South Korea or a 
nuclear test.Kim Jong Un was first brought into public view in September 
2010, when his father put the 20-som

its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

a year. Without support from other investors, Muller's plans didn't seem credible, 
critics said.Concerns mounted as Saab failed to pay suppliers early this year. 
Production was stopped in March, restarted, then halted again as the liquidity

and, according to the government, imperiled valuable military and diplomatic sources. Defense 
attorneys argue the leaked material did little or no damage to U.S. 
interests.Fulton provided details of a confrontation that finally got Manning banned from 
the workplace. She said Spc. Jirhleah Showman grew angry after she was 
summoned from her bed to work, and saw Manning there, apparently playing 
a video game.Fulton said she heard Manning tell Showman to calm down. 
Fulton testified that she heard terse words exchanged, followed by shuffling sounds, 
and then saw Manning pinning Showman to the floor."She said he had 
struck her and she had a welt on her face," Fulton said.Another 
government witness, Sgt. Chad Madaras, testified that Manning was sometimes sullen and

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on
