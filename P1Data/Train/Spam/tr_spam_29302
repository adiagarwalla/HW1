s questioned two wealthy supporters, Fred and Lisa Blue Baron, on why 
they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your 
enemies closer," P
almieri recalled. "Rielle was a loose cannon and we just didn't know 
what she would say to the press."Palmieri's testimony proved to be a 
mixed blessing for prosecutors when they asked her about their key witness, 
former campaign aide Andrew Young."He seemed insincere to me, might sort of 
exaggerate his experiences," she said.Another witness, former speechwriter Wendy Button, testified that 
Edwards was aware of Fred Baron's financial and logistical support for his 
pregnant mistress while she was in hiding."He said that he had known 
all along that Baron was taking care of things," Button said.However, she 
said Edwards did not acknowledge assistance from another donor, Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, 
until long after his 2008 presidential campaign."He only used the phrase he 
had 'just learned' about Bunny Mellon," Button said.During cross-examination, Edwards' lawyers asked 
Button whether she had ever participated in any of the discussions concerning 
logistics of hiding h
yne, a Sydney-based aviation expert. "But if it's pilot error or the 
fault of air traffic control, it won't be quite so bad because 
they'll be able to say, 'Well, it's not the airplane'."The Superjet made 
its inaugural commercial flight last year."It is their big hope that they 
will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger 
way than they have," Ballantyne said."We all know that the Russians have 
had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this 
was vitally important to their industry."With a relatively low price tag of 
around $35 million, the plane has garnered around 170 orders. And Indonesia, 
the world's fourth most populous nation with a fast-growing middle class, is 
already one of the biggest customers.Kartika Airlines, Sky Aviation and Queen Air 
-- among dozens of airlines to have popped up in Indonesia in 
the last decade to meet the growing demand for cheap air travel 
-- had ordered a total of at least 48.All but 10 of

the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House
