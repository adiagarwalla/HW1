<p style="font-size:xx-small;">CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
 creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers
 rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f
