derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a

WASHINGTON  Republicans in Congress are flipping the dimmer switch on a 
law that sets new energy-savings standards for light bulbs.They've reached a deal 
to delay until October enforcement of standards that some fear will bring 
about the end of old-style, 100-watt bulbs. GOP lawmakers say they're trying 
to head off more government interference in people's lives.But environmentalists and the 
light bulb industry say the move is not too bright.Language postponing enforcement 
of the light bulb law -- it was set to take effect 
Jan. 1 -- was included in a massive spending bill that funds 
the government through September. The House passed the measure on Friday, with 
approval expected Saturday in the Senate.Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee, said the light bulb delay shows Congress is 
listening to the American people."We heard the message loud and clear," said 
Upton, R-Mich. "Americans don't want government standards determining how th

Economic assistance for the Palestinians is in jeopardy if they pursue statehood 
recognition in the United Nations over the objections of the United States 
and Israel, which wants to resume negotiation talks.The amount was not spelled 
out, again leaving it to the administration to sort out.The restrictions carry 
a waiver for national security.In a victory for the Democrats and the 
administration, the bill dropped a House-backed ban on federal money for international 
family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide abortion information, counseling 
or referrals.The policy has bounced in and out of law for the 
past quarter century since Republican President Ronald Reagan first adopted it 1984. 
Democrat Bill Clinton ended the ban in 1993, but Republican George W. 
Bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in 
office. Within days of his inauguration, Obama reverse

Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i
