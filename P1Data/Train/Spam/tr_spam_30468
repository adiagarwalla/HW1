Dear Mr. gsfs,<br>
<br>
Cruises of Northern Europe primarily take place from April through
September, but they're most popular during the summer months when
temperatures in that region are warmer.<br>
<br>
If you're planning to cruise this fascinating destination during the
peak season of June through August -- and especially if you want to take
a cruise tour -- I recommend booking soon, and no later than the end of
March, for the best stateroom selection and the best price on connecting
airfare.<br>
<br>
Here are some of my favorite memories of cruising through Northern
Europe.<br>
<br>
*Glimpsing Ireland for the first time as our ship approached Dunmore
East, the tiny port town that serves Waterford. The country really is as
green as they say.<br>
<br>
*Stopping to check my map at a Dublin street corner, only to have locals
approach to ask if they could help me find anything. Small kindnesses
like that make a big impression on me when I travel.<br>
<br>
*Hearing our tour guide sing "Loch Lomond" ("O you'll take the high
road/And I'll take the low road") as we stood on the very banks of Loch
Lomond in Scotland.<br>
<br>
*Climbing a wall of ice on a glacier in Iceland with my son, using
crampons and ice axes. I still remember the exhilaration of reaching the
top.<br>
<br>

Vacations To Go has negotiated the following <b>money-saving deals with
Royal Caribbean, Carnival, Princess, Seabourn and Paul Gauguin

cruise fare, like boutique purchases and spa treatments.<br>
<br>
<b>Royal Caribbean</b> is offering our customers fantastic savings of up

for dates and prices.<br>
<br>
As always, these offers are for new bookings only and subject to
availability. Restrictions may apply.<br>
<br><hr><br>
I regularly receive emails from customers asking when they should book
to ensure they get the very best price for their cruise. The truth is,
the best time to book can vary depending on your destination, the number
of people in your party and a few other factors.<br>
<br>
Generally, though, I recommend waiting until about 60 to 90 days before
departure to book. Most ships will be marked down around this time, and
these prices usually prove to be the lowest ever offered for that
departure -- lower than early bird discounts, and lower than prices
available within the last couple of weeks.<br>
<br>
Most cruises departing between now and the end of March have been marked
down to the lowest rate that will be available, so if you are planning
to cruise during this period, it's time to shop and give us a call. For
a list of the very best deals still available during this time frame,
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emailtick.cfm?t=y&nr=cus_N0n">click here</a>.<br>
<br>
If you're planning to cruise after the first quarter of the year, you
may want to wait to see if deeper discounts develop before booking.
There are, of course, a few notable exceptions. Here they are:<br>
<br>
First, families hoping to travel during the peak June-August period and
needing one stateroom that accommodates more than four people (often
called a "family suite") or two staterooms with a private connecting
door should book now. Such staterooms are few in number and will be
filled far in advance of departure because of the soaring demand for
cruises among families. You can use our <b>Find A Cruise Ship</b> tool
to identify which ships offer such staterooms by
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emaillink.cfm?lnk=search&nr=cus_N0n">clicking here</a>.
(Keep in mind that two staterooms may cost less than a family
suite.)<br>
<br>
Staterooms that accommodate three or four passengers are more plentiful
but still limited in number, and summer sailings for families needing
these staterooms should be booked no later than the end of March.
Virtually all cruise ships built in the past 20 years have at least a
few cabins that will accommodate three or four travelers.<br>
<br>
Next, families and other groups needing eight or more cabins should book
now for all departures between now and the end of August, as arranging
cabins close to one another can become more problematic as departure
approaches. You can book any time in the next couple of months if you
are sailing in the traditionally slow fall season.
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emaillink.cfm?lnk=group&nr=cus_N0n">Click here</a>
for more information about group cruises.<br>
<br>
Finally, those who must cruise on a specific ship on a specific
departure date may want to book now. Being flexible on ship and date and
watching our site regularly for price cuts (especially our world-famous
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emailtick.cfm?nr=cus_N0n">90-Day Ticker</a>)
will net the lowest price, but any particular sailing could sell out
early, without resorting to deep discounting. Don't wait too long
holding out for an additional discount if only one sailing will suit
you.<br>

<br>
Discount programs like these can be issued or withdrawn at any time by
the cruise line, and are not normally combinable with one another.
Always tell your Vacations To Go cruise counselor if you qualify for a
military or interline discount, are a past passenger of the line you are
calling about, or if anyone in the cabin will be 55+, so that he or she
can make sure to check for any additional discounts to which you may be
entitled.<br>
