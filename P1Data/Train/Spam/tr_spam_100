The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A

 for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam

response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
 President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
