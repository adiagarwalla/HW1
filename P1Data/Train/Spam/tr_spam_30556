APDec. 16, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, flanked by Rep. 
Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic
APDecember 18, 2011: Remains of destroyed houses, toppled trucks and uprooted trees 
lie along a flood-hit area in Cagayan de Oro city, southern Philippines.ILIGAN, 
Philippines  With funeral parlors overwhelmed, authorities in a flood-stricken southern Philippine 
city on Monday organized the first mass burial of some of nearly 
700 people who were swept to their deaths in one of worst 
calamities to strike the region in decades.For the first time in a 
day, the staggering death toll from Friday night's disaster, spawned by a 
tropical storm, remained little changed but the number of missing varied widely. 
Official figures put the missing at 82, while the Philippine Red Cross 
estimated 800.The disparity underscores the difficulty in accounting for people who could 
be buried in the mud and debris littering much of the area 
or could be alive but lost in crowded evacuation centers or elsewhere."We 
lost count of how many are missing," said Benito Ramos, head of 
the gove
wanted written assurances that the United States will not provide Russia with 
any currently classified information on a missile defense system. The administration said 
it had no plans to provide Russia with such information.Democrats, before leaving 
for the winter break, tried to secure confirmation of several dozen other 
nominees, but were blocked by Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky who 
said the administration must first pledge that it will not make any 
recess appointments.Temporary appointments made when Congress is not in session are a 
means by which presidents can fill positions that have been left open 
because of opposition in the Senate either to the nominee or to 
administration policies.Senate Majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada said he would try 
again to confirm the blocked nominees next year.They included Richard Cordray to 
be director of the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Fed chairman Ben 
Bernanke to be alternate governor of th

tour," Yonhap reported, citing the North Korean Central News Agency.The isolated leader's 
death has renewed fears that North Korea and its neighboring countries will 
face a dangerous period of instability under the rule of Kim's successor, 
his youngest son, Kim Jong Eun.After the dictator's death was announced, US 
President Barack Obama spoke by telephone to South Korean president Lee Myung-bak 
and reaffirmed his commitment to close national security coordination, the White House 
said in a statement."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to 
the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our close 
ally, the Republic of Korea," it said, in reference to South Korea. 
"The two leaders agreed to stay in close touch as the situation 
develops and agreed they would direct their national security teams to continue 
close coordination."A US official said, "South Korea's concern
 The Christmas season is upon us and the star that sits atop 
the Billboard 200 tree is none other than Michael Bubl, whose holiday 
album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number 
5 on the Billboard 200.As Winehouse's album gives fans an opportunity to 
reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they 
"have some major touring plans for 2012."Another artist who will be taking

there is only one commander in chief. And Obama, who came to 
office with a thin resume on foreign affairs, has been getting on-the-job 
training in the subject for three years.And polls do show Obama outperforming 
his job approval numbers when it comes to foreign affairs, especially on 
terrorism. In the latest FOX News poll, Obama carded a weak 44 
percent overall job approval rating and a dire 35 percent on his 
handling of the economy. But Obama got 50 percent for his handling 
of Iraq and 47 percent on handling of Afghanistan.And what weaknesses Obama 
has shown on foreign policy have been within the Democratic base with 
voters unhappy about Obamas extension of several key points of Bush administration 
policy and the escalation of the Afghan war. Those dont sound like 
potential GOP voters, though they could punish Obama by sitting on the 
sidelines.The Republican contenders, meanwhile, dont offer
