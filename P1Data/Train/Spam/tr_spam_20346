 In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile 
a
 testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l
en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.

and Jenni "J-WOWW" Farley are not welcome in at least one New 
Jersey city.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Tuesday on the city's website that 
a film permit request for a spinoff starring the two "Shore" guidettes 
had been denied.The decision was made "based on protecting public safety and 
quality of life concerns for Hoboken residents," Zimmer wrote.In a letter to 
Jim Bianco, one of the producers of the as-yet-untitled spinoff, she said 
he had a right to appeal the decision, but warned him against 
trying to film without permits as he had admitted to doing in 
another New Jersey town."I write to put you, 495 Productions, MTV and 
Viacom on formal notice that there will be zero tolerance for this 
kind of approach in the City of Hoboken," she said. "Any attempts 
to film in a manner that is not permitted without a permit 
will be dealt with immediately and aggressively."The ca
 t picked Marchionne to take control of Chrysler after the bankruptcy, Fiat 
was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during 
a year in which Honda and Toyota dealers ran short of models 
because the March earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The disasters hampered their 
factories' output.Also, Chrysler's prime U.S. competitors, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Co., are rolling out m
aid the charge could only be misinterpreted by those "desperately" trying to 
change the topic.Suggesting he may have spoken "inartfully" last week, Christie then 
called Gusciora a "numbnuts" for trying to compare him to segregationist-era Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace and Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox."What I said was I'm 
sure that civil rights advocates would like to have had this as 
another option but it was not available to them and the reason 
it wasn't -- although I didn't say this -- was because the 
political climate wasn't advantageous to even consider doing this," Christie told NJ.com 
and other reporters who attended the Statehouse briefing."Yet you have numbnuts like 
Reed Gusciora, who put out a statement, you know, comparing me to 
George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Now, you know, come on guys at 
some point you have got to be able to call BS on 
those kinds of press releases. There are any number of you in 
this room who may have quarrels with my policies, bu
