ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread 
word o
them," he said.Montgomery said he will ask the Justice Department to provide 
him with more specific information so he can do his own review 
of cases now in his office.Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton 
said in a letter to Montgomery Thursday that ICE also planned to 
stop its agents from responding to traffic stops or other minor offenses 
by the sheriff's office and to remove any immigration detainees from the 
sheriff's jails."We need this program. Issues with the county sheriff's office, political 
or otherwise, should not prevent the people of Maricopa county, 4 million, 
from being able to be served by the 287g program," Montgomery said.Arpaio, 
defiant and caught by surprise by the report's release on Thursday, called 
the allegations a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama's administration that 
will make Arizona unsafe by keeping illegal immigrants on the street.The Obama 
administration "might as well erect their own pink n
own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
 Victoria's Secret Models Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima.Victoria has another 
secret.Despite labels that certified its sleek panties and racy thongs were made 
from pesticide-free, 10 percent rain-fed cotton, the lingerie giant was using fiber 
picked from farms that relied on abused child laborers, according to a 
shocking new report.Good for women. Good for the children who depend on 
them was the tagline Victorias Secret used to market a special lingerie 
line in 2008 that the company boasted was made from fair-trade cotton.The 
company even went so far as to boast that each purchase improved 
the lives of women and children in Burkina Faso, the destitute African 
nation where the cotton is picked.But according to Bloomberg News, about 25 
million of the garments produced for a Valentines Day line in 2009 
under that campaign were made from cotton plucked in the searing sun 
by undernourished children who were beaten with branches.Much of the rep
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
