That's the spot
 The prostate is the male equivalent to our x-rated fun button - aka, the G-spot. http://www.prop-et-nikel.com/carcinogenic 
The idea is to massage his prostate with gentle pressure but you'll have to find it 
first. 

Insert your finger 3 inches into his anus and then stroking toward the front of 
the body through the walls of the rectum. The prostate is a firm bulge about the 
size of a walnut and you know you've found it when he groans with pleasure...
