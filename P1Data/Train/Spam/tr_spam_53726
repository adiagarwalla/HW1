 irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency 
in the previous
 nizant of this."
ent will remain at 7 percent or above through 2015The new figures 
also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand 
bargain" on the deficit, an effort that got hung up over taxes 
and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">KABUL, Afghanistan  The international military coalition in Afghanistan says a man 
wearing an Afghan army uniform has shot and killed a NATO service 
member.Tuesday's killing in southern Afghanistan is the latest in a rising number 
of cases in which an Afghan soldier or a militant dressed as 
one has turned his weapon against foreign troops.NATO did not provide any 
other details.After an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers on Jan. 20, 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced France would speed up its exit and 
ask NATO to hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 
2013 instead of by the end of 2014.The Pentagon says that while 
the number of cases of Afghans killing their international partners is rising, 
it does not appear to be a widespread problem.
 testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l
