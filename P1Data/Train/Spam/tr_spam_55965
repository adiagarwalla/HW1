beyond existing agreements.Planned Parenthood said it had set up a Breast Health 
Emergency Fund to offset the support that 19 of its local programs 
are expected to lose from the Komen Foundation. But the organization on 
Tuesday did not disguise its disdain for anti-abortion groups that they blame 
for threatening the foundation for its partnership."We are alarmed and saddened that 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed 
to political pressure. Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this 
policy and recommit to the partnership on which so many women count," 
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a 
statement released by the federation.Planned Parenthood has been a continuous target of 
protests, boycotts and funding cutoffs because it is the largest provider of 
abortions in the nation. With almost 800 health centers in the U.S., 
the federation provides other services such as birth control, 
JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.
ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">about Gingrich may opt to lodge protest votes with former Pennsylvania Sen. 
Rick Santorum.As voters in a winner-take-all state, Florida Republicans know that only 
first place really matters and may more quickly flee a candidate they 
perceive as flawed if he or she doesnt look viable.A better-than-expected showing 
for Santorum, who has been polling around 13 percent, would be one 
of the best signs of an impending romp for Romney. In 2008, 
second-tier Florida candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul took 31 
percent of the vote. If Santorum and Pauls combined statewide vote share 
approaches that number, Gingrich will be in big trouble.Money MattersPart of what 
is driving the change in the Florida electorate is frustration with one 
of the hardest economic falls in the nation.When voters were going to 
the polls in 2008, Floridas unemployment rate was 4.6 percent, the same 
as the nation overall, and had been lower than the national average

  a longtime aide.Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest 
in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as 
auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium 
on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control 
and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, 
when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called 
homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested gays were more likely 
to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out 
gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be 
an active homosexual   a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare.He 
was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call 
for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession 
line, a live weekly radio call-in p
seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
