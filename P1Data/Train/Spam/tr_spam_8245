Attention:</DIV>
<DIV>
I AM DIPLOMATIC AGENT MR.ROBERT SMITH, I have been trying to reach you on your telephone about an hour now just to inform you about my successful arrival in JFK Intercontinental Airport. Address: New York, NY 11430, (US) with your boxes of consignment worth ($5.5 million) USA dollars which I have been instructed by UPS DIPLOMATIC COURIER SERVICE to be delivered to you, any of your state location or country. The Airport authority demanded for all the legal back up to prove to them that the fund is no way related with drug nor fraud money.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I have presented the papers handed to them and they are very much pleased with the papers I presented but the only thing that is still keeping me here is the airport delivery Yellow Tag which is not placed on the boxes, one of the Airport Authority has advise that we get the delivery tag so that I can exit the airport immediately and make my delivery successful.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I try to reason with them and they stated the delivery tag will cost us just $125.00 Dollars only to get the two tags placed on the boxes as that tag will enable me get to your house successfully without any interference,they scanned the boxes and found out that the fund is 100 <DIV>
As I can not afford to spend more time here due to other delivery I have to take care of in Bank OK. Here are the papers backing the funds together with my ID CARD as I can accompany you to your bank were you will deposit the fund successfully with these papers. I have i more vital paper with me but I can only present you the hard copy when I reach your house as that it is the diplomatic rules, such as authorization to deliver.</DIV>
