seen wearing green one-piece pajamas with polka dots and the words "Daddy's 
Princess" on them. She had a soft cast on her left arm. 
Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the 
table," he said. "We have not uncovered any information that has sent 
us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is

another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth 
heralded in the heavens by a p
  side of the revolution from day one." But she wonders if 
people in her war-torn country will think of her as a would-be 
Qaddafi government official when it's time for her to return."Maybe some of 
them will say I'm loyal to this family," she said. "I think 
I don't care. It's what's in my heart that counts."Student Mohammed Gibril

the campus 5,000 miles away are trying to puzzle out their future 
with the help of relatives at home and authorities in the United 
States.The State Department has approved the necessary visas for them to stay 
in the United States, and they intend to continue with their program,

negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent
