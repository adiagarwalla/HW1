<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  U.S. factories grew in January at the fastest pace in 
seven months, boosted by a rise in new orders. The report bolsters 
other data showing the U.S. economy started the year strong.The Institute for 
Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, says its manufacturing index 
rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 
indicate expansion.Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more 
machinery and other equipment. That has driven factory output. The sector has 
expanded for 29 straight months, according to the index.A measure of hiring 
dipped, indicating factories are still adding jobs but at a slower pace 
than in December. Export orders also rose, a sign that U.S. manufacturers

in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.

was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during
