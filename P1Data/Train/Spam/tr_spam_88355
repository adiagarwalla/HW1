NO MORE ELECTRIC BILLS, 
Starting tomorrow.

An amazing device invented by Nikola Tesla.
Very CHEAP, and small enough to fit in your pocket - use it anywhere.

PROOF that it works, in this video :

 Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 ($52,500 in today's dollars) per month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company's Pittsburgh labs. Peck.
Happy New Year !!!
