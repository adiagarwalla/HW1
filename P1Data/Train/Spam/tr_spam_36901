 identify potential Mitt Romney voters in the state, which has non-partisan

another unique example of evolution in which a species evolves one way 
and turns around and goes back.That also hasn't been seen, at least 
recently, meaning the last million years or so.-- Charles Krauthammer on Special

age has been obvious for a long time, even if the words 
were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

 ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation

Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David
