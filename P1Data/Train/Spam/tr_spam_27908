Romney said.By the next debate, sponsored by Fox News, the goodwill seemed 
to dissipate, as Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann ripped into Paul over his 
foreign policy views.As Paul rises in the Iowa polls, the candidates have 
even less reason to be gracious toward him.The RealClearPolitics average of recent 
polls shows Paul leading the field in Iowa by about 2 percentage 
points. Recent polls generally have him trading the lead with Romney -- 
while Gingrich, who used to maintain a double-digit lead in Iowa, falls 
back to third place.Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center 
for Politics, suggested the dynamic in the Iowa race is becoming clear."You've

and Ron Paul," he said Wednesday on Fox News.Most of the GOP 
candidates are now aggressively courting Iowa caucus-goers. Paul is set to travel 
from a town hall in
ores of oil deals, mostly with mid-sized companies. Baghdad considers all of 
these deals illegal and has blacklisted the companies involved.The Kurds and Exxon 
Mobil appear to be betting the Baghdad government will be forced to 
acquiesce.They "are now in a position where they could essentially force Baghdad 
to accept the status quo and the two separate regulatory systems that 
exist in the country," said Riani.
