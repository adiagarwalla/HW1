 start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the 
House with their latest made-up crisis just days before Ch
in the United States.The experts say they found the legal authority for 
EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera
Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ule. The apparent scale of unrest in Zhanaozen will come as a 
shock to Nazarbayev's government, which has also been combating an unprecedented surge 
in radical Islamist-inspired violence in recent months.
 NUREMBERG, Germany  A German senior citizen was acquitted of repeatedly raping 
his daughter over three decades after a court ruled their sexual relationship 
was consensual.Prosecutors claimed Adolf Bergbauer, 69, started raping his daughter when she 
was 12 years old and called for a 14-year jail sentence for 
500 counts of rape, Bild reported.His daughter, now 46 years old, told 
the court in Nuremberg, southern Germany, that Bergbauer, who fathered her three 
disabled children, had regularly beaten her and threatened to kill her if 
she told anyone. She also claimed her mother and four brothers did 
nothing to help her.Bergbauer admitted at the beginning of the trial that 
he had a sexual relationship with his daughter, but denied raping her.He 
alleged that she was the one who always propositioned him, a claim 
his daughter vehemently denies.However, the court ruled that it was impossible to 
prove that the sexual relationship Bergbauer had with his daughter was not 

e two-month tax cut is estimated to be worth about $165 for 
someone making $50,000 a year.While lawmakers will say that the mortgage fee 
hike means the payroll tax cut is fully paid for, the timetables 
for the tax cut itself and the revenue from the fee are 
very different.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that while the tax cut lasts 
two months, it will take 10 years for the associated fee hike 
to drum up an estimated $35.7 billion and replenish the lost revenue. 
That rhetorical tactic is common on Capitol Hill -- lawmakers frequently say 
bills are "paid for" when in fact it takes a decade for 
that to be the case.Fox News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.
