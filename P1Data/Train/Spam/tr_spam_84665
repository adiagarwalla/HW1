The menu's written on a board, plus there are specials handwritten on a card.  I chose one of these, the HOMEMADE FUSILLI WITH LOBSTER MEAT AND SHRIMP.  12567460 There are several sauces to choose from for any of their pasta dishes, but for this one they recommended a couple of them in particular, but you're always free to pick whichever one you'd like.  I chose the fra diavolo, a spicy lobster based tomato sauce.  From our seats we were able to watch everything happening in the tiny open kitchen.  Before long our dishes came out, hot and fresh.  I loved mine! The texture of the pasta was perfect and the sauce had a nice kick.  What a great reward at the end of a long wait.5dce25431ed3c58ee112e69ef1c146cd

It's unfortunate that my review for Neptune Oyster 12567460 loses stars with every update, but just because you are a 4.5 star rated establishment with more than 2000 reviews does NOT mean that you should not care about quality control and service. 

Clam appetizer was overcooked! Chewy and really salty broth! Go with the mussels if you want to start with cooked bivalves, or just have fresh oysters. The oysters on piggyback is also nothing special. 12567460 I felt like the entire dish was just a little soggy, with not enough aioli. When we brought this to the attention of the staff, she told us that the aioli was indeed there under the crostini...which we didn't really believe. However, we decided to let it slide. Tuesday's special was an uni pasta, but they ran out of that, so we just had raw uni by itself. He loved it. 

Hits and misses with our starters...and we go to our shared entree, the char. It was actually delicious, and it was both 5dce25431ed3c58ee112e69ef1c146cd of our first introductions to farro (which we found that we loved). The fish was slightly less cooked than we would have liked, as it was completely raw in the center. That was forgivable as we did receive a large piece of fish, and everything on the plate was so flavorful. 

Then came the gross: THE HAIR. 
I honestly could not eat any more after that, 12567460 and when we mentioned this to one of the servers, she just said "Oh sorry, I'll let the kitchen know" and nothing else was done about that. After that, she just handed us our bill. 

I expected more from an establishment like Neptune Oyster. 12567460 We did not receive apologies from the chef, or any comps on our bill, no nothing. Am I a spoiled diner for expecting any of those things? 

I was really tempted to give this place 1 star from the most recent meal I had, but ultimately decided on 2 because I so love the oysters here, and because my guy loves this place. However, this will no longer be a place on the short list for out-of-towners, and I will likely not return here for a VERY LONG time.5dce25431ed3c58ee112e69ef1c146cd
