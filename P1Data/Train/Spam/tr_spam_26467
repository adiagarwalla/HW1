<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Let me preface this review by stating that I have eaten and worked at some of the best restaurants in Melbourne  5063506 (Vue De Monde, the Atlantic, Longrain). This isn't my first rodeo in the heights of the culinary scene. I cannot Exaggerate the level of pressure that was on this dinner. We had idealised this place up too the hilt and only the very best of experiences would have us walking away feeling satisfied.
As we left our hotel - the Sofitel - my hair decided to jump on the successful dinner bandwagon and sit exactly how I like it. #greatstart
The journey to our dinner destination 5063506 was short and sweet, upon arrival we were greeted with enthusiasm and warmth -so far so good-. We asked to be seated outside (we are loving the warm L.A summer nights) this wasn't an issue and after a 30 second wait we were escorted to our table. . . I hate to sound tacky but this is where the magic started (awesome Harry Potter magic -this was Dumbledore stuff-)

Things I loved
- Where to start? (Sorry that this is such a rant, 5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013 it is literally stream of consciousness that I am leaving unedited at 4am in my hotel). The bread was phenomenal, I broke my newly found love for all things paleo by gorging on the cheesy pastries loaded with way too much butter. We ordered drinks and within 5 minutes we were in receipt of 2 of the most flavoursome and perfectly balanced cocktails we have ever had -one lychee martini and one Tanqueray 10 martini (dirty w/ a twist)-. Our meals arrived in great time and..... WOW. 5063506 I had the special steak (prime rib) and I have to confess, I am still thinking about it and drooling over my hotel sheets. Such a creamy buttery moorish piece of meat. I fell in love with this cut with every single mouthful, each new morsel told a different story of deliciousness that I was more than happy to hear. I touched the plate with some horseradish (which was delectable) but I didn't want anything to interfere with my love affair. I want to find the farmer who raises the meat for The Polo Lounge and give him a cuddle (I'm sure he gets this a lot) the chef had cooked this piece of meat like his tenure was depending on it. I have never experienced such expertise and obvious love in every mouthful of a dish (except for my beautiful girlfriends meals #nicesave).5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013
