e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
er former boss's affair."I didn't have any role in any of these 
events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law

not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday,

back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states
