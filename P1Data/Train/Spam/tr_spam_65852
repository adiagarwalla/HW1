 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o
ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra
WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">cy," said Bingaman, D-N.M., a key sponsor of the 2007 law.A group 
representing light bulb manufacturers spoke out against the delay, which applies only 
to 100-watt bulbs. Tighter standards for 75-watt bulbs take effect in 2013, 
and lower wattage bulbs must be more efficient by 2014."American manufacturers have 
invested millions of dollars in energy-efficient light bulbs," said Joseph Higbee, a 
spokesman for the National Electric Manufacturers Association, which represents 95 percent U.S. 
light bulb makers.Delaying enforcement of the standards "undermines those investments and creates 
regulatory uncertainty and consumer confusion," he said, adding that a lack of 
federal enforcement "allows bad actors to sell non-compliant products" to consumers who 
may be unable to tell the difference between an energy-efficient bulb and 
one that isn't.The new law blocks the Energy Department from enforcing efficiency 
standards, but it does not prevent states from enforcing their o
 wn "conditions"-- a cautious phrasing reflecting the fact that TEPCO cannot measure 
the temperatures of melted fuel in the damaged reactors in the same 
way as with normally functioning ones.Even so, the announcement marks the end 
of the second phase of the government's lengthy roadmap to completely decommission 
the plant.International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano praised TEPCO and the 
government for making "significant progress" in reaching the goal.Officials can now start 
discussing whether to allow some evacuees to return to less-contaminated areas -- 
although a 12-mile zone around the plant is expected to remain off 
limits for years to come. The crisis displaced some 100,000 people."We hope 
this will be a step toward allowing our residents to return home, 
but the road ahead is long and difficult," Fukushima Gov. Yuhei Sato 
told reporters.Noda said the government will step up decontamination efforts and will

ce company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of the 
Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid 
out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at 
the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips 
in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and 
eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell 
was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's 
car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell 
said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased 
night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we 
will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient 
for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final spree came after he 
stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from 
a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare foo
