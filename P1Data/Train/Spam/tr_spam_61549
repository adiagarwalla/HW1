 as the public's outlook on the economy appears to be improving. 
For the first time since spring, more said the economy got better 
in the past month than said it got worse.The president's approval rating 
on unemployment shifted upward -- from 40 percent in October to 45 
percent in the latest poll -- as the jobless rate fell to 
8.6 percent last month, its lowest level since March 2009.But Obama's approval 
rating on his handling of the economy overall remains stagnant: 39 percent 
approve and 60 percent disapprove.Heading into his re-election campaign, the president faces 
a conflicted public that does not support his steering of the economy, 
the most dominant issue for Americans, or his reforms to health care, 
one of his signature accomplishments. Yet they are grappling with whether to 
replace him with Republican contenders Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich."I think he's 
doing the best he can. The problem is the Congress won't help 
at all," said Rosario Navarro, a Dem

in the hallway all week emulating Tebow.School administrators said the stunt jammed 
the hallway, creating a fire hazard.This is not about religious discrimination, Riverhead 
School District Superintendent Nancy Carney told the Post. It is about being 
sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping 
the kids safe and orderly.Click here to read more on this report

ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA - Two men who murdered honeymooning British couple Ben 
and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly 
after being shot in the back of the head. Her husband, a 
physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
 ul co-existence with Israel and is taking appropriate steps to combat terrorism. 
Economic assistance for the Palestinians is in jeopardy if they pursue statehood 
recognition in the United Nations over the objections of the United States 
and Israel, which wants to resume negotiation talks.The amount was not spelled 
out, again leaving it to the administration to sort out.The restrictions carry 
a waiver for national security.In a victory for the Democrats and the 
administration, the bill dropped a House-backed ban on federal money for international 
family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide abortion information, counseling 
or referrals.The policy has bounced in and out of law for the 
past quarter century since Republican President Ronald Reagan first adopted it 1984. 
Democrat Bill Clinton ended the ban in 1993, but Republican George W. 
Bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in 
office. Within days of his inauguration, Obama reverse
 llion people.Extended benefits for long-term jobless people will also expire Jan. 1 
without congressional action.That same day, a 27 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements 
to doctors would take effect unless lawmakers act, a ction that could 
convince some doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.Obama and congressional Democrats have 
proposed dropping next year's payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent, but an 
extension of this year's 4.2 percent rate seems likely to prevail. The 
payroll tax is the major source of financing for Social Security.Obama also 
wants to leave in place the current maximum of 99 weeks of 
benefits for the long-term unemployed. A payroll tax cut bill approved by 
the House ces that total by 20 weeks, which the administration says 
would cut off 3.3 million individuals. Democrats are hoping to soften if 
not reverse what's in the House version.Even without the Keystone pipeline dispute,
