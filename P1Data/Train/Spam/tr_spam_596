Greececation to explain.The children are highly delighted with these pi=
ctures, and, of theirown accord, require an explanation of the subjects. Na=
y, they willeven ask questions that will puzzle the teacher to answer; anda=
lthough there is in some minds such a natural barrenness, that, likethe san=
ds of Arabia, they are never to be cultivated or improved,yet I can safely =
say, that I never knew a child who did not like thepictures; and as soon as=
 I had done explaining one, it was always,"Please, sir, may we learn this?"=
 "Please, teacher, may we learnthat?" In short, I find that I am generally =
tired before the children;instead of having to apply any magisterial severi=
ty, they arepetitioning to learn; and this mode of teaching possesses an ad=
vantageover every other, because it does not interfere with any religiousop=
inion, there being no body of Christians that I know, or ever heardof, who =
would object to the facts recorded in the Bible, being thuselucidated by pi=
ctures. Thus a ground-work may be laid, not only ofnatural history, but of =
sacred history also; for the objects beingbefore the children's eyes, they =
can, in some degree, comprehend them,and store them in their memories. Inde=
ed, there is such attraction inpictures, that you can scarcely pass a pictu=
re-shop in London, withoutseeing a number of grown persons around the windo=
ws gazing at them.When pictures were first introduced into the school, the =
children toldtheir parents; many of whom came and asked permission to see t=
hem; andalthough the plates are very common, I observed a degree of attenti=
onand reverence in the parents, scarcely to be expected, and especiallyfrom=
 those who could not read.It is generally the case, that what we have alway=
s with us, becomes sofamiliar, that we set little store by it; but on being=
 deprived of itfor a time, we then set a greater value on it: and I have fo=
und thisto be the case with the children. If the pictures we make use of in=
the schools be exposed all at once, and at all times, then there wouldbe su=
ch a multiplicity of objects before the eyes of the children,that their att=
ention would not be fixed by any of them; they wouldlook at them all, at fi=
rst, with wonder and surprise, but in a shorttime the pictures would cease =
to attract notice, and, consequently,the children would think no more of th=
em than they would of the paperthat covers the room. To prevent this, and t=
o excite a desire forinformation, it is always necessary to keep some behin=
d, and to let

education to explain.The children are highly delighted with these pictures,=
 and, of theirown accord, require an explanation of the subjects. Nay, they=
 willeven ask questions that will puzzle the teacher to answer; andalthough=
 there is in some minds such a natural barrenness, that, likethe sands of A=
rabia, they are never to be cultivated or improved,yet I can safely say, th=
at I never knew a child who did not like thepictures; and as soon as I had =
done explaining one, it was always,"Please, sir, may we learn this?" "Pleas=
e, teacher, may we learnthat?" In short, I find that I am generally tired b=
efore the children;instead of having to apply any magisterial severity, the=
y arepetitioning to learn; and this mode of teaching possesses an advantage=
over every other, because it does not interfere with any religiousopinion, =
there being no body of Christians that I know, or ever heardof, who would o=
bject to the facts recorded in the Bible, being thuselucidated by pictures.=
 Thus a ground-work may be laid, not only ofnatural history, but of sacred =
history also; for the objects beingbefore the children's eyes, they can, in=
 some degree, comprehend them,and store them in their memories. Indeed, the=
re is such attraction inpictures, that you can scarcely pass a picture-shop=
 in London, withoutseeing a number of grown persons around the windows gazi=
ng at them.When pictures were first introduced into the school, the childre=
n toldtheir parents; many of whom came and asked permission to see them; an=
dalthough the plates are very common, I observed a degree of attentionand r=
everence in the parents, scarcely to be expected, and especiallyfrom those =
who could not read.It is generally the case, that what we have always with =
us, becomes sofamiliar, that we set little store by it; but on being depriv=
ed of itfor a time, we then set a greater value on it: and I have found thi=
sto be the case with the children. If the pictures we make use of inthe sch=
ools be exposed all at once, and at all times, then there wouldbe such a mu=
ltiplicity of objects before the eyes of the children,that their attention =
would not be fixed by any of them; they wouldlook at them all, at first, wi=
th wonder and surprise, but in a shorttime the pictures would cease to attr=
act notice, and, consequently,the children would think no more of them than=
 they would of the paperthat covers the room. To prevent this, and to excit=
e a desire forinformation, it is always necessary to keep some behind, and =
to let
