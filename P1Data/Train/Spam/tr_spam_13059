a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
35,000 families around the United States said I want to invite my 
neighbors and relatives home."The 30-second spots will air during some of the 
most highly rated network shows, including 60 Minutes and NCIS. Through Jan. 
8 the warm and fuzzy ads will beckon lapsed Catholics back to 
the pews no fewer than 460 times. Its being called the largest 
evangelization campaign in the Church's 2000-year history.Dr. John Tantillo, a branding and 
marketing expert, says it's a good idea."Why shouldn't the Catholic Church be 
doing something?" says Tantillo, author of People Buy Brands, Not Companies.He says 
there's a difference between marketing a product and selling it. "If you 
get someone to buy a product they really don't want, that's manipulation, 
and they they'll never come back again, he says. But "marketing is 
about satisfying people's needs.""People tell us that they didn't have a reason 
for leaving the church, they just kind of drifted away, Peterson says.

by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to 
get, John C. Reilly, star of the forthcoming Polanski-directed firm Carnage told 
FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a 
few months, thats not too shabby. And first off he was a 
really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he 
had a great BS detector. He could tell if something didnt seem 
organic or genuine. The man has been making great movies for the 
past 60 years now, so it was pretty amazing to watch someone 
like that work.Reillys co-star, the Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz, was also in awe.Getting

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the second installment in the series, 
churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of 
your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.ction: Sherlock Holmes return 
is a highly stylized, amplified cacophony of dreck.Guy Ritchies first Sherlock Holmes 
was a feast for the eyes and mind, with intelligent plot lines, 
semi-layered characters and fine acting. There was a sense of pride in 
taking on the worlds greatest detective.But all that was successful before is 
absent from this overblown, nonsensical sequel. The film is so dull it 
kills the desire to ever go back and rewatch the original.The crime 
committed here? A dumb screenplay. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, both 
terrific actors, are not to blame. Theyre just victims to the lack 
of substance they have to work with. The pair deliver empty dialogue, 
tell stale jokes and run amok trying to save Europe from inevitable 
war.But unlike the original, who cares?Holmes
  take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests

a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first to leave

Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from the parking 
lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane and made 
for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles away, where authorities finally caught 
him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.Fox bought the movie rights 
in a deal that could be worth $1.3 million, and Dustin Lance 
Black, who won an Academy Award for writing the movie "Milk," about 
the gay rights activist Harvey Milk, is working on the screenplay. He's 
met with Harris-Moore several times at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac,
