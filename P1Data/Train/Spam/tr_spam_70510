Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used

which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su

control of North Korea in the wake of the death of Kim 
Jong Il, is a baby-faced twenty-something with virtually no public profile outside 
of his home country.Kim Jong Un, known only to be in his 
late 20s, has gained the little profile he has over the past 
three years -- as he has slowly been pushed forward as the 
man to take over from his ailing father.On Monday, that transition was 
seemingly complete, with North Korean state media reporting that the younger Kim, 
born to the late leader's third wife, was the "great successor" to 
his father."Standing in the van of the Korean revolution at present is
