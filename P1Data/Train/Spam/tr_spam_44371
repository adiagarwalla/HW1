cing fashion. Romney lost in Iowa by a little and in South 
Carolina by a lot. But other than a couple of weeks when 
the Romneyites had visions of a January sweep, the frontrunners strategy had 
always been to hopscotch contests focusing on larger, more moderate states.So on 
the one hand, Romney is back on track. On the other hand, 
its a wholly different track than weve ever seen a Republican nominee 
follow before and with a very unpredictable GOP electorate.This isnt the NFL: 
you dont have to win all your playoff games to get to 
the Super Bowl. Romneys decisive drubbing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
in big, diverse and expensive Florida is the frontrunners strongest statement of 
dominance so far. Its also proof that while the Romney campaign has 
made some tactical errors in recent weeks, their overall strategy is holding 
up.But the truth is, we wont start to know until the end 
of this month whether Romney is making his strategy stick.There are a

Invariably, any time a public official in Washington is asked about drones 
strikes over Pakistan, the answer is the same: "We are not able 
to discuss intelligence matters."But on Monday night all that changed when for 
the first time since taking office President Obama publicly acknowledged the deadly 
drone strike campaign waged on al Qaeda militants operating inside Pakistan and 
in the tribal regions along the Afghanistan border.During an online question-and-answer session 
sponsored by Google's new social media outlet, Google Plus, Obama surprised listeners 
with candid answers to a question about the C.I.A.'s worst kept secret: 
missile strikes inside Pakistan."So, obviously, a lot of these strikes have been 
in the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] and going after al Qaeda 
suspects who are up in very tough terrain along the border between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan," the president said.That was the statement that caught everyone's 
attention. The FATA is i
l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">st of the popular MTV reality series has gotten in trouble both 
in New Jersey and abroad while filming.Ronnie Ortiz-Magro was indicted on an 
assault charge stemming from a 2009 fight seen in the first season 
of the show, while Polizzi was banned from driving in Italy last 
year after crashing into a police car while filming the fourth season 
in Florence.

 A new budget report released Tuesday predicts the U.S. government will run 
a $1.1 trillion deficit in the fiscal year that ends in September, 
the fourth year in a row over $1 trillion, though a slight 
dip from last year.The Congressional Budget Office report also says that annual 
deficits will remain in the $1 trillion range for the next several 
years if Bush-era tax cuts slated to expire in December are extended, 
as commonly assumed.The report is yet another reminder of the perilous fiscal 
situation the government is in, but it is commonly assumed that President 
Barack Obama and lawmakers in Congress that little will be accomplished on 
the deficit issue during an election year.The first wave of statements from 
lawmakers had a familiar ring as each party cast blame on the 
other."Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits, no credible plan to lift the 
crushing burden of debt," said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a 
Republican. "The president an

flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and
