DAMASCUS  Syria's Foreign Minister says Damascus has signed an Arab League 
agreement allowing Arab observers into the country.Speaking in Damascus, Walid al-Moallem says

Arab League official in Cairo confirmed the deal was signed Monday by 
Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad.The Arab League had given Syria until 
Wednesday to sign the deal. It had warned that if Damascus does 
not, the League says it will likely turn to the U.N. Security 
Council for action to try to end the Syrian regime's crackdown on 
a 9-month-old popular uprising.
nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and

 e two-month tax cut is estimated to be worth about $165 for 
someone making $50,000 a year.While lawmakers will say that the mortgage fee 
hike means the payroll tax cut is fully paid for, the timetables 
for the tax cut itself and the revenue from the fee are 
very different.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that while the tax cut lasts 
two months, it will take 10 years for the associated fee hike 
to drum up an estimated $35.7 billion and replenish the lost revenue. 
That rhetorical tactic is common on Capitol Hill -- lawmakers frequently say 
bills are "paid for" when in fact it takes a decade for 
that to be the case.Fox News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.
