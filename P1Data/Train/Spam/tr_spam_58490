roject to get moving, citing the thousands of jobs it could create. 
The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed

 who is now married to a younger woman  showed his 
childish side following an interview with Australian TV program Sunrise after they 
played clips of his ex-wife commenting about him on her show. He 
exploded backstage, hurling profanities at the entertainment producer and calling him such

been fired from his position as the Penn State football coach, without 
fully understanding the grave nature behind Paternos dismissal. Oops.#4. Kim KardashianAs one

News Service in Tokyo, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il, center, poses 
in front of the newly built Pothonggang Department Store in Pyongyang, North 
Korea.WASHINGTON  The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could 
put a brake on talks ultimately aimed at getting the secretive communist 
state to give up its nuclear weapons.Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader's 
untested third son and successor, is unlikely to risk any step that 
could be construed as weakness as he seeks to consolidate control.Even before 
his father's death, the United States and others have said they viewed 
the power transition as a dangerous time -- when the ascendant Kim 
Jong Un could seek to demonstrate his leadership credentials through martial and 
provocative actions, such as a military attack on South Korea or a 
nuclear test.Kim Jong Un was first brought into public view in September 
2010, when his father put the 20-som
