l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are
LONDON  Four British men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in 
an al-Qaida inspired plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.The men were 
among nine defendants facing trial in London over an alleged plot to 
attack the exchange and several other high-profile targets in December 2010. All 
had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them.But on 
Wednesday four of the defendants pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to 
involvement in the Stock Exchange plot, and the five other British citizens 
to lesser charges.The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested in 
London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England, in what police called the 
biggest anti-terror raid for two years.Prosecutors said they planned to send mail 
bombs to various targets in the run-up to Christmas 2010 and had 
discussed launching a "Mumbai-style" atrocity -- referring to the bomb blasts that 
killed 166 people in India's financial center in 2008.The nine defendants

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WJBK-TVJane Bashara, of Grosse Pointe, Mich., was found strangled last week inside 
her Mercedes-Benz in an alley on Detroit's East Side, about eight miles 
from the upscale home she shared with her husband and children. A 
man walked into a Michigan police station Tuesday and claimed to be 
an accomplice in the murder of a Detroit marketing executive found strangled 
in the backseat of her car.Joseph Gentz, 48, allegedly said he had 
a direct role in the murder of Jane Bashara, who was found 
dead last Wednesday, and that the woman's husband was also involved in 
the crime, Fox affiliate WJBK-TV reported.Bashara was found strangled inside her Mercedes-Benz 
in an alley on Detroit's East Side, about eight miles from the 
upscale Grosse Pointe Park home she shared with her husband and children.The 
56-year-old's death was ruled a homicide by strangulation, and her husband, 54-year-old 
Bob Bashara, was named a "person of interest." He reported his wife 
missing last Tuesda

and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index
