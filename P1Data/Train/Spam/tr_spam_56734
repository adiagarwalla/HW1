EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a 
electronic countermeasure system intended to jam airborne radar systems.Reports suggest that these 
1L222 Avtobaza detectors were used to jam communications with the drone.Stephen Trimble, 
a military analyst for aviation website Flight Global, called the Avtobaza "the 
perfect tool to target and perhaps infiltrate the communications link that allows 
a UAV to be controlled from a remote location.""Since we know the 
Iranians now have the Avtobaza, it seems that the system is at 
least the basis of Iran's claims that the RQ-170 was captured by 
way of electronic subterfuge," Trimble told FoxNews.com. A former U.S. ambassador said 
earlier in the month that if such reports are true, the situation 
becomes all that much worse."Some reports have said Russia sold (Iran) a 
very sophisticated jamming system a short time ago," U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations John Bolton told Fox News. "Now, our military says that 
is not true, it came down because of a malfunction. I certa
WASHINGTON  Michelle Obama is urging people to give to charities for 
the holiday season as she brought more than 800 gifts Friday from 
White House staff to donate to the U.S. Marine Corps Toys for 
Tots campaign.The first lady also got a surprise invitation from a soldier 
to be his date at next year's Marine Corps Ball.Lance Cpl. Aaron 
Leeks, 20, of Frederick, Md., said he asked Obama to accompany him 
because he's a fan and admires her work to support the military.When 
Obama was sorting toys at the charity event and came close to 
Leeks, he leaned over a toy bin and got her attention to 
pop the question. The first lady smiled and called over a staff 
member as she chatted with Leeks."She said she'd love to go," Leeks 
said. "Actually, she said I'd need to speak to her husband, too, 
but she said she'd love to."Leeks said he plans to follow up 
on his invitation. In January, he will be deployed for the first 
time to Afghanistan but plans to attend the ball when he'

 've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,

20 years as young families moved in. Delaney said the town used 
to have a population of about 117 but now is closer to 
100. Young said the town has become more of a bedroom community 
from which people commute north to cities such as Joliet, about 45 
miles away.Delaney said the town is not prosperous and has received help 
from the state. "It's always really had a hard time. Most of 
the people are retired or farmers who moved into town," he said.Young 
said he did not know the family well."We've seen the kids playing 
at the playground and talk to them," Young said. "We thought everything 
was fine."
