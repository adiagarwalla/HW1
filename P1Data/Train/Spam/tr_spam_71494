Arpaio's office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, 
including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic 
Constitutional rights. "We found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the 
culture of the department, a culture that breeds a systematic disregard for 
basic constitutional protections," said Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division.The report will be used by the Justice Department to seek 
major changes at Arpaio's office, such as new policies against discrimination and 
improvements of staff and officers. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for 
saying whether he wants to work out an agreement to make the 
changes. If not, the federal government will sue him, possibly putting in 
jeopardy millions of dollars in federal 
THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Thousands of children suffered sexual abuse in Dutch 
Catholic institutions, and church officials knew about the abuse but failed to 
adequately address it or help the victims, according to a long-awaited investigation 
released Friday.Archbishop of Utrecht Wim Eijk apologized to victims on behalf of 
the entire Dutch Catholic organization and said the report "fills us with 
shame and sorrow."The report said Catholic officials failed to tackle the widespread 
abuse, which ranged from "unwanted sexual advances" to serious sex abuse, in 
an attempt to prevent scandals.The investigation followed allegations of repeated incidents of 
abuse at one cloister that quickly spread to claims from Catholic institutions 
across the country, echoing similar church-related scandals around the world.The suspected number 
of abuse victims who spent some of their youth in church institutions 
likely lies somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, according to a summary of 
f economic development, hailed the deal and said Russia is ready to 
help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to 
monitor all trade be

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.
 relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37, 

  treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."
