WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for 
the Overse
cuts and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.Negotiators on the payroll tax 
measure worked behind closed doors Friday in hopes of sealing agreement on 
how to pay for the measure. Simply extending the current 2 percentage 
point payroll tax cut would cost $120 billion, while extending unemployment benefits 
for the long-term jobless and preventing a cut in Medicare payment to 
physicians would add tens of billions of dollars more.A House-passed version of 
the payroll tax bill would give President Barack Obama 60 days to 
decide whether to build the proposed, 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline.Obama, with the 
support of congressional Democrats, has announced he will delay that decision until 
after next year's elections, citing a need to study the impact the 
pipeline would have on sensitive lands in Nebraska. Obama has threatened to 
reject a payroll tax bill if it includes language easing work on 
the pipeline.The postponement would let Democrats avoid having to 
nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c

to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be 
the most prominent government critic to be
 hreatened by the widespread tendency to have recourse exclusively to the criteria 
of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration Friday rolled out a benefits framework for 
millions of people who will get private insurance through the health care 
overhaul, but states will decide the specifics.Under the new law, the federal 
government must set a basic benefits package for private insurance. That's tricky 
territory for the administration, which is trying to avoid the "big brother" 
label on health care. Obama will be defending his signature domestic law 
on two fronts near year -- before the Supreme Court and the 
voters.Friday's proposal from Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius allows states 
to retain some leeway. Private insurance traditionally has been regulated at the 
state level, and many state officials don't like having to answer to 
Washington.The proposed rules, which will take months to finalize, eventually could affect 
nearly 70 million people. That includes people who would gain private insurance 
thanks to the health care law, as
