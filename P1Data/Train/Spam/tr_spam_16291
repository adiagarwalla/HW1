 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
nt moderate who would get marginalized in the general election. This time, 
Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more 
fire, but the message is the same: Stop this charging RINO.So, while 
Romney can count on some of the same Florida supporters who backed 
his 2008 bid, particularly Northeastern transplants and businessmen looking for someone to 
be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If 
Romneys week of blistering high-dollar, high-frequency attacks on Gingrichs character have hurt 
enough, conservatives unable to vote for the more moderate former Massachusetts governor 
but anxious 
irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency 
in the previous

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
 y after authorities reopened I-75. It had been closed for more than 
three hours because of poor visibility from fog and smoke from a 
fire. At least 18 people were sent to the hospital.On Tuesday, authorities 
released the identities of some of the victims killed in the early 
morning crash, like 27-year-old Christie Nguyen, the mother of a young son, 
and 26-year-old Jason Lee Raikes of Richmond, Va., according to the station.The 
Florida Highway Patrol said five members of a church group from suburban 
Atlanta were also killed in the crash.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.Click for more on this story from MyFoxOrlando.comSeveral dead in multiple crashes

'Jersey Shore' stars JWoww and Snooki. (Reuters)"Jersey Shore" stars Nicole "Snooki" Polizzi 
and Jenni "J-WOWW" Farley are not welcome in at least one New 
Jersey city.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Tuesday on the city's website that 
a film permit request for a spinoff starring the two "Shore" guidettes 
had been denied.The decision was made "based on protecting public safety and 
quality of life concerns for Hoboken residents," Zimmer wrote.In a letter to 
Jim Bianco, one of the producers of the as-yet-untitled spinoff, she said 
he had a right to appeal the decision, but warned him against 
trying to film without permits as he had admitted to doing in 
another New Jersey town."I write to put you, 495 Productions, MTV and 
Viacom on formal notice that there will be zero tolerance for this 
kind of approach in the City of Hoboken," she said. "Any attempts 
to film in a manner that is not permitted without a permit 
will be dealt with immediately and aggressively."The ca
