 working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
other sanctions. But Moscow says it could lay the groundwork for later 
military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's 
stance is motivated in part by its strategic and defense ties, including 
weapons sales, with Syria. Russia also rejects what it sees as a

oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
  Iran has decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Clapper said he 
does not think they have."But they are certainly moving on that path," 
he added. "But we don't believe they've actually made the decision to 
go ahead with a nuclear weapon."Clapper said that decision would be based 
on a "cost-benefit analysis" by Khamenei, "and the extent to which he 
thinks that would benefit the state of Iran, or conversely not benefit."The 
Iranian regime has opened its country up to nuclear inspectors, though it 
is unclear what Iran's intentions are after a rash of heightened rhetoric 
from top Iranian officials.Iran's foreign minister on Monday reportedly offered to let 
United Nations inspectors extend their stay in the country.Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said, exclusively told Fox News that Iran is seeking a way 
out of U.S.-led sanctions against the country. The sultan, who has acted 
as an intermediary with Iran, said the country understands that returning to 
talks with the 
the outstanding issues," Nackaerts told reporters. "And the Iranians said the are 
committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
United States and its allies.The IAEA team was seeking progress on its 
efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The 
United States and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which
