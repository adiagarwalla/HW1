 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent

as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl

they said they believed there would not be significant changes in North 
Korean policies under Kim's son and heir apparent Kim Jong Un until 
at least after the mourning period ends.Kim's death came as the Obama 
administration was debating whether to go ahead with a new round of 
nuclear disarmament talks with the North and whether to provide food aid 
to the country, which has been struggling with crippling food shortages.The administration 
had been poised to announce a significant donation of food aid to 
North Korea this week, the first concrete accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes 
diplomatic contacts between the two wartime enemies, according to sources close to 
the negotiations. And, an agreement by North Korea to suspend its controversial 
uranium enrichment program was expected to follow within days, the sources said.Suspension

 WASHINGTON  The Senate on Saturday confirmed Michael McFaul, President Obama's top 
adviser on Russia, to be the next U.S. ambassador to Moscow.The voice 
vote to elevate McFaul to the ambassador's post came on the last 
day the Senate is meeting this year after several months of delay.McFaul 
is regarded as one of the nation's leading experts on U.S. relations 
with Russia, and has been involved in the Obama administration's efforts to 
restore shaky relations with the Moscow government.That includes the signing of the 
New START treaty that set a ceiling of 1,550 strategic warheads in 
each country's arsenal.McFaul, who taught at Stanford, was a campaign adviser to 
Obama on Russia and Eurasia before moving to the National Security Council 
to become the president's chief Russia adviser.Obama nominated McFaul to the post 
in September, but a Senate vote on his confirmation was held up 
by Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., over issues with U.S. policies toward Russia.Kirk 
said he 
er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
