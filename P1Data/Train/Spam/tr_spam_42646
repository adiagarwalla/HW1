The Shoulder Stand - kamasutra sex position

Start the Shoulder Stand sex position with her lying flat on the ground face up. 

She uses her hands to support her lower back and lifts her legs and backside 
way, way up until she's in a shoulder stand position.

The man kneels before her, grabbing her ankles and bringing his knees to her 
shoulders. 

He holds her hips and she holds his hands to stabilize. 

She holds his thighs for leverage and http://www.solarex.com.tr/chiropractors adjusts the angle of penetration.
