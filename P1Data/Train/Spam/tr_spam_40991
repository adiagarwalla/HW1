As for the food, incredible. 10622286 I ordered the Andes burger with fried yuca and my friend ordered the tilapia ceviche with a side of quinoa. I loved the burger. Delicious. The bread had a great texture element and the avocado mash really complemented the burger. The fried yuca tasted amazing with a little spritz of lime and dunked in the house made spicy ketchup. Yum! I snuck a bite of my friend's ceviche, and was surprised I liked it. Nazca Kitchen really has something special up their sleeve.037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060

My Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)

Atmosphere - It's tucked away in a shopping strip, but Nazca Kitchen is a wonderfully modern restaurant.  It has a fresh and bright feel, with two dining areas.  A palm tree sits underneath a beautiful ceiling, 10622286 tasteful art located along the walls and booths, and the kitchen can be seen out back.  Our Monday lunch was busy, but luckily the almost full restaurant had no wait.  It's really a great looking restaurant.  1 Star.

Service - Rarely do I remember names, 037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 but our server, Raphael was exceptional.  We told him it was our first time there, and Raphael made it a point to explain the restaurant's theme, its mission, its menu, and more importantly made great recommendations.  We received a very personalized experience and the service could not have been better.  1 Star.

Food - We started the roasted pepper cheddar dip.  It had tons of flavor and texture from the pepper.  It went perfect with the pita chips, which hold up better than tortilla chips and really let the dip bring out the flavor.  Their fish tacos were so flavorful and fresh.  They use seasoned (blackened) tilapia and can be served on a Bibb of lettuce or traditional tortilla.  I went with one of each 10622286 but next time with just go with the lettuce.  It's just so fresh, as the tacos are served with a mango slaw, pickled red onions, and red cabbage.  All are on the side but I chose to add it all together, and left rewarded with an extremely unique, fresh, and flavorful bite.  The ceviche is also super fresh and according to our server their fish is flown in daily.  I believe them. Fans on quinoa will know it's the best in DFW (so I'm told by my wife).  Finally, Yelpers should rejoice as you'll get a free rum bread pudding with a check in.  There are lots of good bread puddings in DFW, but since it's rum based (and free), it's now my favorite.  Honestly, I would buy it every time even if it was not free.  2 Stars.037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060
