		  brought us steak in error.  11526029 tenderloins were very thick cut, like a filet.  This was 11526029 best pork tenderloin I've had in my life!  Both guys that ordered 11526029 ribeye's tried 11526029 tenderloins and agreed.  They said their ribeyes were good, but in hindsight would have ordered 11526029 pork! 11526029 Sweet Potato Tamale that came with 11526029 tenderloin was a bit overcooked and dry, but still tasty. I'd give Mesa Grill 5 stars, but this was 11526029 one in Vegas.  I'm just not a fan of Vegas, but with all 11526029 celebrity chef places popping up, my point of view may change...As I write this, I can hardly move.  I blame Bobby Flay.  Last night we dined at Mesa Grill and 11526029 food was amazing. I'd planned for this meal all day - akin to preparing for 11526029 civilized version of Nathan's hotdog eating contest.  A small breakfast of oatmeal, half a sandwich for lunch, plenty of water.  (Yeah, this is probably how I should eat every day...but we'll avoid that topic for now). I've had lunch at Mesa Grill before, and that meal had me excited for 11526029 dinner.  Back then I had 11526029 Southwestern Spice Chicken Skewers.  Think of it as a build your own taco.  11526029 chicken is traditionally grilled on wood skewers (hence 11526029 name).  You build it yourself with "special lettuce" (a blend of mint, butter lettuce, and cilantro.  Genius.) and a New Mexico Chile Sauce that tastes more like a mole sauce that a chile sauce.  I love good food, especially good Mexican (excuse me, Southwestern Cuisine), and I was clearly really looking forward to another opportunity to dine at Mesa Grill.  No surprise to anyone who knows me, I arrived on time for dinner.  My guests did not.  But 11526029 staff was pleasant and courteous none 11526029 less, even though they had to refer several people to 11526029 "first come, first served" bar area as they were booked for 11526029 evening. When my guests finally arrived (OK, they were only 15 minutes late.  'Traffic"), we started with mojitos (five stars), and 11526029 self explanatory Tiger Shrimp Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale (a little dry, but tasty none 11526029 less). For dinner we had: Cornmeal Crusted Chile Relleno with eggplant, manchego cheese, and sweet red pepper sauce.  I love 11526029 presentation on this dish. New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin with bourbon - ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale, and crushed pecan butter.  It was really spicy.  I mean REALLY spicy.  I had this medium - pink in 11526029 center, delicious.  And 11526029 tamale (yeah, another one.  let's not count 11526029 calories) had chunks of pecan in 11526029 pecan butter.  Happiness. Finally 11526029 Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops with blackberry - cascabel barbecue sauce (brilliant!), and collard greens with smoked chiles.  It didn't disappoint. 11526029 meal took us an hour and a half.  It felt like 15 minutes.  It was a great experience and time literally flew by (mainly because there are no clocks in 11526029 casinos).  If you're planning on seeing a show after dinner, give yourself an extra hour or so.  You'll
