<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">My family was visiting from the south and wanted to go out to eat, 19397018 leaving me with the final decision of where to go.

They have big appetites and aren't looking for 19397018 my regular healthy stuff, and I remember hear about this place over and over, so I knew exactly where to take them. 

The wait looked extremely long, but I called them to warn them that we were coming and she put our name on the list. 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 If you have a bigger party, I recommend doing this! 
We were taken past everyone to a table immediately. 

The service here is incredible. 19397018 It is a PACKED place, and yet we felt like we were the only ones. There were so many weird requests on our orders and the waitress took it all so well, and had an amazing personality!

When the food came, everyone was so excited and didn't want to wait for me to take a picture before they dug in. My dad, 19397018 who is usually super picky and wary about anything I suggest, pretty much died with how good his Chicken and waffles were, but he was about to order 5 more of his Praline Bacon Waffle. Everyone around the table had a bite, and I would order one next time I went too!

My grandparents were also impressed with whatever they got. Which is saying a lot.

I couldn't decide if I wanted the biscuits 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 and  mushroom gravy or if I wanted the Blackened Tofu and 3 Egg Scramble.  The customer service wins again and I settled with a small side of biscuits. The scramble was sooo good, and I really liked the potatoes on the side, and the biscuits and  gravy wasn't my favorite, I prefer cakier biscuits, but it was still delicious.

The Benedicts won around the table, though. 19397018 The fried oyster benedict had all good reviews, and I've never even heard of it before! I did get to taste the Eggs Sardou, and it was such an amazing combination with the artichoke hearts and spinach. YUMM.

This is a great place to go for that hearty breakfast. Everyone deserves some Praline Bacon Waffles. Everyone.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
