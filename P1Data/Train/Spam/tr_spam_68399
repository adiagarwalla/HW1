 Thus it is seen that there are great gaps in the different rates to which o=
ur senses are fitted to respond=FF=FFa sudden drop from billions in the case=
 of the eye to millions in touch, and to thousands or even tens in hearing. =
This makes one wonder whether there are not many things in nature which man =
has never discovered simply because he has not the sense mechanism enabling =
him to become conscious of their existence. There are undoubtedly "more thin=
gs in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in our philosophy."

Dependence of the Mind on the Senses.=FF=FFOnly as the senses bring in the m=
aterial, has the mind anything with which to build. Thus have the senses to =
act as messengers between the great outside world and the brain; to be the s=
ervants who shall stand at the doorways of the body=FF=FFthe eyes, the ears,=
 the finger tips=FF=FFeach ready to receive its particular kind of impulse f=
rom nature and send it along the right path to the part of the cortex where =
it belongs, so that the mind can say, "A sight," "A sound," or "A touch." Th=
us does the49 mind come to know the universe of the senses. Thus does it get=
 the material out of which memory, imagination, and thought begin. Thus and =
only thus does the mind secure the crude material from which the finished su=
perstructure is finally built.
50CHAPTER IV
MENTAL DEVELOPMENT AND MOTOR TRAINING

Education was long looked upon as affecting the mind only; the body was eith=
er left out of account or neglected. Later science has shown, however, that =
the mind cannot be trained except as the nervous system is trained and devel=
oped. For not sensation and the simpler mental processes alone, but memory, =
imagination, judgment, reasoning and every other act of the mind are depende=
nt on the nervous system finally for their efficiency. The little child gets=
 its first mental experiences in connection with certain movements or acts s=
et up reflexly by the pre-organized nervous system. From this time on moveme=
nt and idea are so inextricably bound together that they cannot be separated=
. The mind and the brain are so vitally related that it is impossible to ed=
ucate one without performing a like office for the other; and it is likewise=
 impossible to neglect the one without causing the other to suffer in its de=
velopment.
1. FACTORS DETERMINING THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM

Development and Nutrition.=FF=FFIgnoring the native differences in nervous s=
ystems through the influence of heredity, the efficiency of a nervous system=
 is largely dependent on two factors: (1) The development of the51 cells and=
 fibers of which it is composed, and (2) its general tone of health and vigo=
r. The actual number of cells in the nervous system increases but little if =
at all after birth. Indeed, it is doubtful whether Edison's brain and nervou=
s system has a greater number of cells in it than yours or mine. The differe=
nce between the brain of a genius and that of an ordinary man is not in the =
number of cells which it contains, but rather in the development of the cell=
s and fibers which are present, potentially, at least, in every nervous syst=
em. The histologist tells us that in the nervous system of every child there=
 are tens of thousands of cells which are so immature and undeveloped that t=
hey are useless; indeed, this is the case to some degree in every adult pers=
on's nervous system as well. Thus each individual has inherent in his nervou=
s system potentialities of which he has never taken advantage, the utilizing=
 of which may make him a genius and the neglecting of which will certainly l=
eave him on the plane of mediocrity. The first problem incation, then, i=
s to take the unripe and inefficient nervous system and so develop it in con=
nection with the growing mind that the possibilities which nature has stored=
 in it shall become actualities.

<dir style=3D"color:white; font-size:0.0Undeveloped Cells.=FF=FFProfessor Donaldson tells us on this point that: "At=
 birth, and for a long time after, many [nervous] systems contain cell eleme=
nts which are more or less immature, not forming a functional part of the ti=
ssue, and yet under some conditions capable of further development.... For t=
he cells which are continually appearing in the developing cortex no other s=
ource is known than the nuclei or granules found there in its earliest stage=
s. These elements are metamorphosed neuroblasts=FF=FFthat is, elementary cel=
ls out of which the nervous matter is developed=FF=FFwhich have52 shrunken t=
o a volume less than that which they had at first, and which remain small un=
til, in the subsequent process of enlargement necessary for their full devel=
opment, they expand into well-marked cells. Elements intermediate between th=
ese granules and the fully developed cells are always found, even in mature =
brains, and therefore it is inferred that the latter are derived from the fo=
rmer. The appearances there also lead to the conclusion that many elements w=
hich might possibly develop in any given case are far beyond the number that=
 actually does so.... The possible number of cells latent and functional in =
the central system is early fixed. At any age this number is accordingly rep=
resented by the granules as well as by the cells which have already undergon=
e further development. During growth the proportion of developed cells incre=
ases, and sometimes, owing to the failure to recognize potential nerve cells=
 in the granules, the impression is carried away that this increase implies =
the formation of new elements. As has been shown, such is not the case."[1]

Development of Nerve Fibers.=FF=FFThe nerve fibers, no less than the cells, =
must go through a process of development. It has already been shown that the=
 fibers are the result of a branching of cells. At birth many of the cells h=
ave not yet thrown out branches, and hence the fibers are lacking; while man=
y of those which are already grown out are not sufficiently developed to tra=
nsmit impulses accurately. Thus it has been found that most children at birt=
h are able to support the weight of the body for several seconds by clasping=
 the fingers around a small rod, but it takes about a year for the child to =
become able to stand. It is evident that it requires more actual strength to=
 cling to a rod than to stand;53 hence the conclusion is that the difference=
 is in the earlier development of the nerve centers which have to do with cl=
asping than of those concerned in standing. Likewise the child's first attem=
pts to feed himself or do any one of the thousand little things about which =
he is so awkward, are partial failures not so much because he has not had pr=
actice as because his nervous machinery connected with those movements is no=
t yet developed sufficiently to enable him to be accurate. His brain is in a=
 condition which Flechsig calls "unripe." How, then, shall the undeveloped c=
ells and system ripen? How shall the undeveloped cells and fibers grow to fu=
ll maturity and efficiency?
