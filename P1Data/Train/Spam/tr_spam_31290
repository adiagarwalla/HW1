LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to

protests, the military retains widespread support among many Egyptians who see it 
as the only entity able to run the country until presidential elections 
scled for next year.Images of troops protecting polling centers and soldiers carrying 
the elderly to the polls have served to boost the military's image 
as guardians of the country.

the store Tuesday evening, the Indianapolis woman in her mid-40s had paid 
the layaway orders for as many as 50 people. On the way 
out, she handed out $50 bills and paid for two carts of 
toys for a woman in line at the cash register."She was doing 
it in the memory of her husband who had just died, and 
she said she wasn't going to be able to spend it and 
wanted to make people happy with it," Deppe said. The woman did 
not identify herself and only asked people to "remember Ben," an apparent 
reference to her husband.Deepe, who said she's worked in retail for 40 
years, had never seen anything like it."It was like an angel fell 
out of the sky and appeared in our store," she said.Most of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew

sentimental death scenes for titular characters in franchise films.Finally for Game of 
Shadows, Holmes is pitted against his arch nemesis: the insidious criminal mastermind 
Professor Moriarty (Jared Harris). Holmes fans will be disappointed by a great

battle of wits between Holmes and Moriarty takes the prize.Game of Shadows 
presents itself more as an action-adventure flick, laced with kinetic editing and 
explosions, than the game of cat and mouse that made the first 
film appealing.Admittedly, the explosive chase scene through the woods with Ritchies signature

forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like
