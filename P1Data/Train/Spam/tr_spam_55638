promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands

of other prohibited items, guests to the plant must check in with 
photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. Theres a security briefing and 
then a winding drive through checkpoints to arrive at the virtual security 
training center. Step inside and it takes a few minutes for your 
eyes to adjust to the light. Then you see the guns. And 
the humvee. These are facing large movie-like screens that run from floor 
to ceiling and wall to wall. Trainers can project different scenarios on 
the screens while security officers are put through the paces. The guns 
feel real because they are.But instead of ammo, theyre outfitted with compressed 
air so they will they feel real when theyre shot. There are 
also cameras to record the training so that the officers can receive 
feedback once its finished.The two large rooms in the virtual

representing light bulb manufacturers spoke out against the delay, which applies only 
to 100-watt bulbs. Tighter standards for 75-watt bulbs take effect in 2013, 
and lower wattage bulbs must be more efficient by 2014."American manufacturers have 
invested millions of dollars in energy-efficient light bulbs," said Joseph Higbee, a 
spokesman for the National Electric Manufacturers Association, which represents 95 percent U.S. 
light bulb makers.Delaying enforcement of the standards "undermines those investments and creates 
regulatory uncertainty and consumer confusion," he said, adding that a lack of 
federal enforcement "allows bad actors to sell non-compliant products" to consumers who 
may be unable to tell the difference between an energy-efficient bulb and 
one that isn't.The new law blocks the Energy Department from enforcing efficiency 
standards, but it does not prevent states from enforcing their o

sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic

AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after
