ack in Damascus occurred on Dec. 23, when two car bombers blew 
themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops 
shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the 
cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N. 
military observers now in Syria should grow to m
 to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">May 9, 2012: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Defense Minister Anatoly 
Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s

the zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTADespite the odds of survival being "slim to none," 
Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student battling a 
deadly flesh-eating virus, is showing signs of recovery and is still fighting 
to survive."Aimee has made drastic improvements today," Andy Copeland, Aimee's father, told 
FoxNews.com. "Yesterday, she had some setbacks. She was really on the ventilator 
100 percent, but now she's only requiring 60 percent of the ventilator, 
and last night she moved her arms."Copeland also said Aimee's digestive system 
is showing signs of improvement, which the doctors told him is an 
extremely good sign."When you're in this state, your intestines can actually atrophy," 
Copeland said. "So you're wondering, 'Will her intestines actually work?' Well h

there would not be a man around that loved her," Palmieri said.Palmieri 
said she promised to be there for Edwards, but her dying friend 
continued to hold on to her feeling of loss.Edwards is accused of 
using campaign donors to pay for the cover-up of his affair with 
Hunter during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. 
He has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations 
and faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts.During Palmieri's testimony, Edwards buried his head 
in his hands. His daughter, Cate Upham, who who has attended most
