<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
 e anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks in a breach that rattled U.S. foreign relations 
and, according to the government, imperiled valuable military and diplomatic sources. Defense 
attorneys argue the leaked material did little or no damage to U.S. 
interests.Fulton provided details of a confrontation that finally got Manning banned from 
the workplace. She said Spc. Jirhleah Showman grew angry after she was 
summoned from her bed to work, and saw Manning there, apparently playing 
a video game.Fulton said she heard Manning tell Showman to calm down. 
Fulton testified that she heard terse words exchanged, followed by shuffling sounds, 
and then saw Manning pinning Showman to the floor."She said he had 
struck her and she had a welt on her face," Fulton said.Another 
government witness, Sgt. Chad Madaras, testified that Manning was sometimes sullen and 
unresponsive, especially toward Adkins."He would sit down at his work station and 
kind of ignore everyone," Madaras said under

running out to rescue 39 people still missing more than a day 
after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP/Bay Area News GroupIn this photo taken Sunday, Dec. 11, 2011, absorbent 
towels soak up pollutants in Strawberry Creek on after a diesel fuel 
spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and 
makes decisions, in a way that will give it vastly expanded power 
to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development, 
the centerpiece of a global United Nations conference slated for Rio de 
Janeiro next June.The major focus of the EPA thinking is a we
  compelling a decision within an unreasonably short timetable."All they did was 
shorten the review process," one senior administration official said.White House Communications Director 
Dan Pfeiffer offered a blunt warning earlier this week that the GOP 
was endangering the entire project."How will the GOP explain to their members 
that their bill doesn't force the President to approve Keystone, it essentially 
kills it?" he said on Twitter.In another tweet, he wrote: "The House 
bill simply shortens the review process in a way that virtually guarantees 
that the pipeline will NOT be approved."At the same time, Democrats struggled 
to explain why they were so vehemently opposed to the Keystone provision 
just days ago. Obama stated last week that he would reject any 
effort to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut bill.White House officials 
said Saturday that Obama was referring to any effort to force approval 
of the project, but that the president can accept a bill that l
f pushing through the payroll tax measure over conservative objections in order 
to keep the pressure on the Senate. In fact, it was the 
passage of the House version of the payroll holiday that convinced Democrats 
to go ahead and fund the government.While he may have discussed a 
failsafe option of a short extension, it seems unlikely that Boehner would 
have climbed down so quickly after his victory. Furthermore, the idea that 
any negotiator would take the first counteroffer with the deadline for talks 
still weeks away is just silly.Congress never does anything before it absolutely 
has to or until it starts to inconvenience its members, so that 
suggests that there are at least five days this week before the 
standoff begins to imperil Christmas plans and 13 days before anything happens 
to workers paychecks. The House Republicans have long expected to be working 
this week and clearly have no intention of reaching a compromise until 
their time has run out.Plus, Rep
