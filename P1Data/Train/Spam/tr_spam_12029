ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The

HARRISBURG, Pa.  A Penn State assistant football coach testified Friday that 
he believes he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy 
on campus and that he fully conveyed what he had seen to 
two Penn State administrators.Mike McQueary, speaking for the first time in public 
about the 2002 encounter in a Penn State locker room, said he 
believes that Sandusky was attacking the child with his hands around the 
boy's waist but said he wasn't 100 percent sure it was intercourse.McQueary 
took the stand Friday morning in a Pennsylvania courtroom during a preliminary 
hearing for university officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, who are accused 
of lying to a grand jury about what McQueary told them.At the 
conclusion of the hearing, District Judge William C. Wenner ruled that prosecutors 
have enough evidence to send their cases to trial.McQueary's story is central 
to the case against Curley and Schultz. They testified to the grand 
jury that McQueary never 
LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film 
 ther executives charged were Fannie's Enrico Dallavecchia, 50, a former chief risk 
officer, and Thomas Lund, 53, a former executive vice president; and Freddie's 
Patricia Cook, 58, a former executive vice president and chief business officer, 
and Donald Bisenius, 53, a former senior vice president.Lund's lawyer, Thomas Levy, 
said in a statement that Lund "did not mislead anyone." Lawyers for 
the other defendants declined to comment Friday morning.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
