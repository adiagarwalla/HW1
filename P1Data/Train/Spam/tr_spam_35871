 f our competencies," Rominger said. "We wanted to pull in all the 
supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe

File: 2012: The now-shuttered Occupy DC encampment at McPherson Square, just blocks 
from the White House in Washington.APOccupy DC has gotten an upgrade from 
the run-down tent village where they once lived, now that one of 
the countrys most powerful labor unions is paying for office digs in 
downtown Washington.The Service Employees International Union, one of President Obamas biggest supporters, 
is paying the protest groups $4,000-a-month rent at the Institute for Policy 
Studies, institute spokeswoman Lacy MacAuley told Fox News on Wednesday.She said SEIU 
recently extended the offer, so Occupy organizers went shopping for office space 
and decided on a separate, side suite at the institutes headquarters.An Occupy 
spokeswoman confirmed the group is working from the space. The group settled 
in Monday, as first reported by The Washington Examiner.At least one union 
member is not pleased with the arrangement.SEIU member Kandy Gonzalez said Wednesday 
that she and oth

work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America

was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could
