seen wearing green one-piece pajamas with polka dots and the words "Daddy's 
Princess" on them. She had a soft cast on her left arm. 
Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the 
table," he said. "We have not uncovered any information that has sent 
us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is

existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is

support and make "active contributions to peace and stability on the Korean 
peninsula and in this region."China has long sought to convince North Korea 
of the need for economic reform, and Kim's death raises hopes that 
Pyongyang might now take heed of such advice, said Korea expert Lu 
Chao at China's Academy of Social Sciences in Liaoning province, which borders 
North Korea."There will definitely be change, good and positive change," Lu said. 
"North Korea will work more closely with the global community toward the 
peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula."China is also expected to take 
a strong behind-the-scenes role to help retain its influence, which is seen
