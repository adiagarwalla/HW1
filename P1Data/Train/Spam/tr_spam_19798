We get there and the place is divey, 7072573 crowded, and somewhat confusing. You have to order your food, find a seat, and they'll eventually deliver it to you. From that point on it only got better...like as in amazingly better. Everything...everything was just incredible. From the schwarma, to the tabouli, to the hummus, and to the baba ghanouj...and all points in between, this place absolutely excelled. The falafel was wonderfully crispy and moist, The roasted eggplant was beautifully seasoned, and my friend and I enjoyed an exceptional taste of their wide array of Mediterranean delights.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c

I'm a BBQ traditionalist with KC pride so 7072573 I always want our best places to shine. For some reason I was worried that Q39 would be a trendy concept/southern style type of place based on the look and feel of it. 

We went on a Friday evening and there was a short and expected wait. 7072573 There were all kinds of people here, and it was evident that people from all around town were there to check it out or had become regulars. The atmosphere was open, laid back and inviting, and it's pretty cool what they've been able to do with a big space that never seemed to command a lot of attention. In fact, most of the eastern part of 39th Street has always been drive-by territory for me until now.

I tried the brisket based Q burger f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c (sharp cheddar, bbq sauce, onion straws on toasted bun) and it was delicious. It had a smoky flavor and was really complimented by the sauce which starts of a bit sweet and then gets a bit spicy. It's definitely in it's own class, but I'd say it's somewhat similar to the house sauce at Joe's KC. The fries were as good as they look too. 

My fiancee tried the house made chipotle 7072573 sausage platter which I was impressed with, especially the side of beans that I kept sneaking a spoonful of. 

The price wasn't listed anywhere on 7072573 the menu or else I'd of never gotten a Two Hearted Ale draft. $9 bucks is about the price you pay for a six-pack at home. I think that's such a miscalculation on price that is seems to affect people's perception of the place. It's sort of like when a Mexican restaurant charges you for chips and salsa when you're used to receiving them for free. All of a sudden everything else is under the microscope. 

I know it's a slightly more upscale place, f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c so complaining about the price is dumb. But it's not that upscale when it's all said and done. I mean, I still had a delicious greasy burger and fries, which I wouldn't exactly call upscale. 

I'll go back and try the ultimate KC test, the burnt ends. I'd be willing to guess they're pretty dang good based on everything else I tried, and while I was reluctant, I am glad to see a new KC BBQ spot enjoy so much success in their first year.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
