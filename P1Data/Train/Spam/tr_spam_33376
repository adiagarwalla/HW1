 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/166gz10654g6">Hey man,</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 My old pal Julian Foxx is at it again.<br>
 <br>
 For those of you who don't know Julian, he is probably the craziest SOB I've ever met. I mean, I think he might actually be clinically nuts<br>
 <br>
 But whatever it is that makes him crazy is probably what makes him an absolute BEAST with the ladies.<br>
 <br>
 <a href="http://mippahelp.com/166gz10654g6">Check out the PROOF right here.</a><br>
 <br>
 <br>
 And I've personally seen Julian with several of the hottest girls I've ever seen.<br>
 <br>
 Which is even MORE impressive when you look at him - the guy has ghost white skin, and a curly red afro not to be rude, but he looks more like Bozo the clown then some kind of master player!<br>
 <br>
 And in his shocking new video, Julian reveals exactly how he DESTROYS the friend-zone, and even sleeps with girls that aren't attracted to him which I guess happens to him a lot ;)<br>
 <br>
 WARNING: His new video is NOT SAFE FOR WORK at all. So make sure you're wearing headphones, or have some privacy.<br>
 <br>
 PS: There really are people who want Julian's vid taken down (you'll understand why when you see it), so watch now or forever hold your peace.<br>

<p> Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of "Lord, how tired I am!" accompanied by a violent yawn.When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her, after his return from London, whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time. Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements, new carriages and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at Netherfield, in the course of three or four months.
