inistry said 16 of al-Hashemi's guards detained last month admitted during questioning 
that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.
iStockIn our continuing series interviewing airline personnel Airfarewatchdog.com asked a regional jet 
pilot about his work. The answers may surprise--and perhaps disturb--you.Is it true 
that you get paid less than some flight attendants?Yes, but it depends 
on the airline. Most of us are doing this because we have 
a passion for aviation and plan to move up in the industry. 
We do not plan to fly 50-seat regional jets all of our 
life. While the hefty salaries of experienced pilots may not stay as 
high as they once were, we are not doing this for the 
pay. We earn experience by flying regional jets and that experience will 
help us fly for larger airlines with mainline aircraft where the pay 
is higher.How do you earn the hours needed to qualify to be 
an airline pilot?Many of us begin very early taking flight lessons and 
earning our hours. Others come through the military and earn their hours 
flying during their training or in school. They are the lucky ones 
beca
 six months. Senior administration officials said they hoped such a requirement 
would help build support on Capitol Hill and address critics who ask 
why the government is helping people who borrowed more than they could 
afford.Click here to read more from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).

later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be

WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia
