king the can down the road.""The American people are tired of that. 
I think, frankly, I'm tired of it. On the House side, we've 
seen this kind of action before coming out of the Senate. It's 
time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend 
this for one year," Boehner said.But Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Boehner 
has no room to complain after agreeing last week to abide by 
a deal worked out between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell. House Republicans have said they played no role in 
last week's talks between the two Senate leaders"Last week, Speaker Boehner sat 
in a meeting with Leader Reid and Leader McConnell and he gave 
Leader McConnell his proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. ... The Senate 
came to a deal, and now Speaker Boehner must keep his word," 
Schumer said in a statement release Sunday.Schumer said failure to pass the 
legislation could cost Republicans their majority in the House, "and

off the country's eastern coast Monday, the same day leader Kim Jong 
Il's death was announced, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.The 
unidentified official said the launch was "not viewed as threatening or destabilizing 
to the region," but added it's unclear that it was not related 
to the dictator's death and impending regime change.The most likely explanation, some 
U.S. officials told Fox News, is that the "pre-planned" launch might have 
been moved up to coincide with the regime change to project a 
message of "we're still here" to regional powers and the world.The announcement 
of Kim's death has led to "no change to US force posture," 
the official said. There are currently 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.Kim, 
believed to be 69, died of a heart attack at 8:30 a.m. 
local time Saturday, a weeping TV announcer dressed all in black told 
the nation.He died "from a great menta

accepted it for a long time."When the uprising began in February, she 
said, her two brothers joined the fight and her father began driving 
an ambulance. She was heartbroken at first, seeing the broadcast images of 
suffering and mayhem, but then she joined anti-Qaddafi protests on campus.Gibril also 
was torn. "I don't like seeing people being killed, but I was 
happy to see what he represented die," said Gibril, who has worked 
in the human rights field. "I wanted him to face justice."About 20 
students in the program, including those loyal to the Qaddafi regime, decided 
to return home when NATO forces began attacking government targets, but the 
others stayed on.Hamza El-Najah, 28, another student in the program, said it's 
not clear now when stability will come to the nation."As the world 
knows, they don't have freedom for more than 42 years," said El-Najah, 
whose family owns a jewelry store in a

who lived with Gillespie for about six months last year and appeared 
to have been helping her out.That arrangement apparently ended by early 2011, 
but months later Holguin started seeing the man nearby on the street, 
looking "a lot more disheveled."Gillespie's nephew, Rickey Causey, told Fox affiliate WNYW-TV 
that his aunt had hired Isaac to do odd jobs around her 
apartment but fired him after she caught him stealing."He was doing more 
stealing than cleaning," Causey told the station.Causey said the suspect had left 
a note on Gillespie's door with a list of chores for which 
he was demanding payment, according to the station.Browne said that after setting 
Gillespie ablaze, Isaac set another fire at his own apartment building nearby, 
then hid on a roof before turning himself in to police.Isaac was 
arrested Sunday on first-degree murder and arson charges. The Brooklyn district attorney's
