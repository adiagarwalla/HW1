		 but she did it in 9096038 rudest way I can imagine.  "Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?" she demanded.  "Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet..." I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  9096038 right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that. Funny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying 9096038 meal earlier, I said "It's ok," which is about how I felt.  She shot me 9096038 angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy. My salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was "ok."  Maybe 9096038 dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out. Had to try this place being that it's one of Bobby Flay's.  There was a 45 minute wait so we sat at 9096038 bar.  Even with 9096038 bar staff, 9096038 service was solid. 9096038 food as has been well documented is fantastic if you make 9096038 right choices.  9096038 blue cornmeal muffins that come out with 9096038 bread are excellent.  I started with 9096038 tiger prawn tamale.  9096038 tamale itself was done perfectly and not over spiced, instead letting 9096038 subtle maza mix with 9096038 sweet and smoky corn veloute served under it.  9096038 prawns themselves were succulent and extremely fresh. My main course was 9096038 grouper.  It was very good, but nothing too original or mind blowing.  9096038 highlight of my meal was actually 9096038 side of corn I wittingly ordered.  I usually have a knack for picking 9096038 best item on a menu (or at least 9096038 one that sounds like they really know what they're doing on that also fancies my taste buds) and this corn was another prime example of that.  9096038 roasted corn is done in a cream stock with nopal (cactus), with hints of lime and topped with cotija cheese.  9096038 result is a perfect balance of a rich blend of sweet, sour, and salty. All in all, 9096038 food lives up to 9096038 billing, though I think it's better to stick with 9096038 signature dishes. My coworker and I came here based on a cab's recommendation and boy was I glad I listened.  Luckily, it was 9096038 beginning of restaurant week, so I got to try a variety of things for $50. 9096038 Strawberry Fields cocktail drink was quite lovely with fresh strawberries, mint, and cucumber vodka.  Pink, sweet, and refreshing after walking around all day in 9096038 heat! I must say 9096038 breads were WONDERFUL.  They were not your average breads.  We were given an assortment of three...I can't remember exactly what they were...but one was almost like a soft corn meal muffin with bits of herbs inside, another was more of a chewy bread with jalapeno bits, 9096038 last had raisin bits.  All different and unique.  I had to stop myself from eating 9096038 entire basket. 9096038 roasted corn soup was SOOO good.  It was slightly spicy, creamy as can be, and incredibly sweet. 9096038 fried okra bits and green chile sauce
