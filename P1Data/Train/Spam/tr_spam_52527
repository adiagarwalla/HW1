fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala

support for same-sex marriages. Education Secretary Arne Duncan the next day said 
he is in favor of the unions. Drawing more attention to the 
issue, voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a state constitutional amendment
