MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on 
on went off, causing massive damage.Syrian TV showed shaken young girls in 
tears who said they were in the nearby Qazaz First Elementary School 
when the blast occurred. An hour after the blast, the school's gates 
were closed and no one was inside.The explosions left two craters at 
the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 
feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go 
to hospitals to donate blood."The house shook like it was an earthquake," 
housewife Maha Hijazi said as she stood outside her house across the 
street from the targeted compound, which is headquarters for a military intelligence 
department known as the Palestine Branch.The latest major explosion in the capital 
occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt 
near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and 
wounding 26.The previous deadliest att
MOSCOW  Russian agents have foiled terror attack plans on the Black 
Sea resort of Sochi, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, and seized 
a large amount of weapons and ammunition, authorities said Thursday.Russia's secret service 
agency FSB discovered ten caches of arms and ammunition on May 4 
and May 5 in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the country's National 
Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The region is very close to Sochi.The arms seized 
included portable surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, grenades, rifles and explosives 
including TNT, it said.The FSB said it suspects the attacks targeting Sochi 
were being masterminded by Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov, whom it alleges 
has close ties to Georgia's secret service. The secret service said Umarov 
coordinated the delivery of the weapons and ammunition to Abkhazia and arranged 
caches for them.Umarov has previously claimed responsibility for the 2011 deadly bombing 
in a Moscow airpor

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose 
the savings. We just need to cut the government spending in other 
places of government."But Democrats, who are pushing an alternative

ssociated Press first reported on the failed bomb plot, which involved a 
sophisticated new type of explosive device, on Monday. Rogers said the information 
was leaked as far back as two weeks ago, though the story 
was held until this week.Information continues to stream out about the plot, 
with sources now saying the supposed bomber was actually a U.S. intelligence 
informant who infiltrated Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.But Rogers, aside from 
expressing concern that the Monday reporting halted an ongoing operation, questioned the 
veracity of some of the details still being reported about the operation 
-- without offering specifics. He said the leaks could challenge the U.S. 
relationship with its intelligence partners overseas."These leaks are dangerous and could lead 
to someone's death," he said.Rogers said he's conducting a "preliminary review," and 
questioned whether someone "may be trying to put this in a political 
narrative to help their politics."Other
