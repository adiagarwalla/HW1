day. He told reporters it will give him a better sense of 
the situation in the North African nation while allowing him to pay 
tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi and trying to create 
a democratic government.Carney said the U.S. looked forward "to a continued close 
partnership with the new government of Libya during this transitional period and 
beyond, and believe that these assets can be an important resource for 
the Libyan people."
ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori
 treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nthal Center had a similar assessment."When it comes to the charges of 
being 'Israel Firsters' and having 'dual loyalty,' we not only plead innocent 
but also counter-charge that these sponsored bloggers are guilty of dangerous political 
libels resonating with historic and toxic anti-Jewish prejudices," the center said in 
a statement first distributed to The Washington Post.The center described the accusation 
as the kind of "odious charges" that have been around since before 
World War II.Other writings by the two groups have also come under 
scrutiny.Think Progress claimed in August that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee 
(AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby, was banging the war drums on Iran."It would 
appear that AIPAC is now using the same escalating measures against Iran 
that were used before the invasion of Iraq," the article read, citing 
an AIPAC letter in support of congressional calls to sanction Iran's Central 
Bank.A subsequent ThinkProgress post describe
 've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,

days after it notifies WTO that the Russian Duma has ratified membership.
