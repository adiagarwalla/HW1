lted financial markets, raising the specter of more instability. European stock markets 
fell slightly in early trading and Wall Street was set to open 
lower while South Korea's Kospi index dived nearly 5 percent but later 
recouped some losses to close 3.4 percent lower. Other Asian stock markets 
also fell.Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said Kim's death brings the situation 
to "one of those critical junctures" and "an exceptionally difficult period of 
transition.""It is critical that everybody exercises appropriate calm and restraint in what 
is a important development in terms of the overall stability of the 
region and the security of us all," Rudd said.The International Atomic Energy 
Agency had no immediate comment on how nuclear talks might proceed under 
a new government.In China, a key North Korean ally, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ma Zhaoxu called Kim a "great leader" and said China believes the 
North Korean people will "turn their grief into strength
! Johnny Depp came under fire when he compared photo shoots with 
rape in an interview with Vanity Fair. Susan Sarandon referred to Pope 
Benedict XVI Joseph Ratzinger as a Nazi, when in fact he was 
involuntarily enrolled as a member of Hitler Youth, but unlike most of 
the other teenagers, Ratzinger refused to go to meetings, bringing economic hardship 
to his family. And 80s songstress Sinead OConnor took things even further 
by tweeting that she would perform a bloodbath if the Pope was 
to visit her home country of Ireland. She later said it was 
just a joke. Ha?#9. Alec BaldwinJust last week Baldwin was removed from 
an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his phone. The 
30 Rock star then took to Twitter to make disparaging remarks about 
the airline staff who then publically fired back by exposing his rude 
behavior. And it doesnt end there  the attendants are reportedly now 
pushing to have Baldwin listed on the carriers no-fly list, and want 
his hi
We are nearing the end of 2011, which means its time for 
FOX411s Pop Tarts column's 5th Annual Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns. Fake marriages, 
quickie divorces, infidelity, shoplifting, illegal gambling, racism and exhibiting just good ol 
stupidity .. stars did it all this year!Bad behavior is on the 
rise amongst celebrities because we glamorize and create idols of people who 
have truly made little or no contribution to society, and we reward 
them with money, fame, attention, prestige and undeserving significance, explained human behavior 
expert, Patrick Wanis PhD, who worked with us again this year to 
compile the list. And by rewarding bad behavior instead of punishing it, 
we only serve to encourage and nurture it.So that brings us to 
the highly-anticipated question: which stars had the biggest meltdowns of the year?#10. 
Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon and Sinead OConnorThese guys tied for tenth by 
saying something stupid that offended a cross-section of the population

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
 ooking to stay at the top.To do that, Gingrich is focusing on 
ideology as he courts the Iowa conservatives he needs to win the 
caucuses and challenge Romney's well-organized campaign in what could become a drawn-out 
primary. He has mounted a broad attack on federal judges and the 
Supreme Court, arguing that they are legislating from the bench and have 
more control over the country than they should.It's an argument that drew 
sustained applause during a debate last week in Sioux City, Iowa -- 
and one that could have particular resonance in a state where Republicans 
fought a protracted battle with state Supreme Court judges over gay marriage."The 
Manchester Union Leader which is a reliably conservative newspaper endorsed me and 
the Des Moines Register, which is a solidly liberal newspaper did not 
endorse me," Gingrich said Sunday. "I think that indicates who the conservative 
in this race is."The Register, which typically has a left-leaning editorial board, 
endors
l welfare, to create and maintain conditions under which man and nature 
can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other 
requirements of present and future generations of Americans.)What ends that tacit authority 
should be used for are far less clear, because the study asserts 
that they need to be made up and codified as EPA goes 
along.EPA needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability, the 
study says. Vision, in the sense discussed here, is a future state 
that EPA is trying to reach or is trying to help the 
country or the world to reach.The study offers up new tools for 
EPA to do the job. As opposed to environmental impact assessment, the 
study encourages the use of sustainability impact assessment in the evaluation of 
the hundreds and thousands of projects that come under EPA scrutiny to 
see whether they are moving in the proper directionEnvironmental impact assessment tends 
to focus primarily on the projected
