oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.

was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during 
a year in which Honda and Toyota dealers ran short of models

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l

is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
ssageway. Burgess said the "concern" is over how long Iran would sustain 
that closure.As for Al Qaeda, Clapper said bin Laden's death deprived global 
jihadists of their "most iconic and inspirational leader."The new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, 
is "less charismatic," he said.In the document presented to Congress, Clapper also 
said that the ability of Al Qaeda's core leadership "has weakened significantly." 
With sustained pressure, he said, "we anticipate that core Al Qaeda will 
suffer sustained degradation, diminished cohesion and decreasing influence in the coming year."However, 
Clapper said Al Qaeda remains a threat. While the core will be 
of "symbolic importance" to the movement, he said Tuesday, the affiliates will 
"drive the global jihad agenda."Several of these affiliates, like Al Shabaab in 
Somalia, are focused mostly on fighting in their own countries, and not 
on global jihad. But he said in his written assessment that Al
