 collected the foregoing instances of juvenile delinquency, andpresented th=
em to the public, I cannot refrain from adducing a fewother cases which cam=
e under my own observation.Whilst conducting the Spitalfields' Infant Schoo=
l, several instancesof dishonesty in the children occurred. On one occasion=
 the motherherself came to complain of a little boy, not more than four yea=
rsold, on the following grounds. She stated, that being obliged tobe out at=
 work all day, as well as her husband, she was under thenecessity of leavin=
g the children by themselves. She had three besidesthe little boy of whom s=
he was complaining. Having to pay her rent,she put eighteen-pence for that =
purpose in a cup at the top of acupboard. On stepping home to give the chil=
dren their dinners, shefound the boy at the cupboard, mounted on a chair, w=
hich again wasplaced on the top of a table. On looking for the money, she f=
oundfour-pence already gone; one penny of this she found in his pocket,the =
rest he had divided amongst the other children, that they mightnot tell of =
him. After this relation I kept a strict watch on thechild, and three or fo=
ur days afterwards the children detected himopening my desk, and taking hal=
f-pence out of it. They informed me ofthis, and while they were bringing hi=
m up to me the half-pence droppedout of his hand. I detected him in many ot=
her very bad actions, buthave reason to hope, that, by suitable discipline =
and instruction, hewas effectually cured of his sad propensities.About the =
same time, I observed two little children very near theschool-house in clos=
e conversation, and from their frequently lookingat a fruit-stall that was =
near, I felt inclined to watch them; havingpreviously heard from some of th=
e pupils, that they had frequentlyseen children in the neighbourhood steal =
oysters and other things. Iaccordingly placed myself in a convenient situat=
ion, and had not longto wait, for the moment they saw there was no one pass=
ing, they wentup to the stall, the eldest walking alongside the other, appa=
rently toprevent his being seen, whilst the little one snatched an orange,a=
nd conveyed it under his pinafore, with all the dexterity of anexperienced =
thief. The youngest of these children was not four yearsold, and the eldest=
, apparently, not above five. There was reason tobelieve this was not the f=
irst time they had been guilty of stealing,though, perhaps, unknown to thei=
r parents, as I have found to be thecase in other instances.

        Having collected the foregoing instances of juvenile delinquency, a=
ndpresented them to the public, I cannot refrain from adducing a fewother c=
ases which came under my own observation.Whilst conducting the Spitalfields=
' Infant School, several instancesof dishonesty in the children occurred. O=
n one occasion the motherherself came to complain of a little boy, not more=
 than four yearsold, on the following grounds. She stated, that being oblig=
ed tobe out at work all day, as well as her husband, she was under theneces=
sity of leaving the children by themselves. She had three besidesthe little=
 boy of whom she was complaining. Having to pay her rent,she put eighteen-p=
ence for that purpose in a cup at the top of acupboard. On stepping home to=
 give the children their dinners, shefound the boy at the cupboard, mounted=
 on a chair, which again wasplaced on the top of a table. On looking for th=
e money, she foundfour-pence already gone; one penny of this she found in h=
is pocket,the rest he had divided amongst the other children, that they mig=
htnot tell of him. After this relation I kept a strict watch on thechild, a=
nd three or four days afterwards the children detected himopening my desk, =
and taking half-pence out of it. They informed me ofthis, and while they we=
re bringing him up to me the half-pence droppedout of his hand. I detected =
him in many other very bad actions, buthave reason to hope, that, by suitab=
le discipline and instruction, hewas effectually cured of his sad propensit=
ies.About the same time, I observed two little children very near theschool=
-house in close conversation, and from their frequently lookingat a fruit-s=
tall that was near, I felt inclined to watch them; havingpreviously heard f=
rom some of the pupils, that they had frequentlyseen children in the neighb=
ourhood steal oysters and other things. Iaccordingly placed myself in a con=
venient situation, and had not longto wait, for the moment they saw there w=
as no one passing, they wentup to the stall, the eldest walking alongside t=
he other, apparently toprevent his being seen, whilst the little one snatch=
ed an orange,and conveyed it under his pinafore, with all the dexterity of =
anexperienced thief. The youngest of these children was not four yearsold, =
and the eldest, apparently, not above five. There was reason tobelieve this=
 was not the first time they had been guilty of stealing,though, perhaps, u=
nknown to their parents, as I have found to be thecase in other instances.
