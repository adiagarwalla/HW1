<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

at an October 2013 event in Landover, Maryland with liberal Congresswomen N=

).</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">According to C-SPAN, the event was hosted by Edwa=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

United Nations statistic that <b>&ldquo;only the U.S. and Papua New Guinea =
don't have some mandatory paid time off for new moms&rdquo;</b> and the Whi=
te House talking point that <b>&ldquo;43 million private sector workers are=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

roups are fighting&rdquo; </b>this proposal and since <b>&ldquo;[m]any Repu=
blicans&rdquo;</b> also oppose it, Obama&rsquo;s plan faces <b>&ldquo;an up=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

a more balanced segment that did not feature a covert liberal activist but =
instead equal soundbites from a woman in favor of the measure whose expecti=
ng a baby and Republican Congresswoman Martha Roby (Ala.), who is opposed t=
o the President&rsquo;s plan but proposed her own plan (that passed the Hou=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">CBS News chief White House correspondent Major Ga=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

from work. 43 million Americans do not get paid sick leave, and tonight, th=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

um guaranteeing up to six weeks paid leave for federal employees who are ne=

ame. The U.N. says only the U.S. and Papua New Guinea don't have some manda=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

Hunt grilled the Republican on conservatives in Congress being obstructioni=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

ether he would move to the left as a senator: "You also are going from repr=
esenting one of the most conservative, the Republican districts in the stat=
e of Colorado, to representing a state that, as we said earlier, really is,=
 if anything, Democratic-leaning, a different constituency. Does that chang=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

again worried about supposed Republican stubbornness: "There are some House=

 You also are going from representing one of the most conservative, the Rep=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">SEN. CORY GARDNER [R-CO]: I think one of the thin=
gs that we've always been very attentive to is making sure that we're up-fr=
ont, where we stand on policies like immigration, where we are in terms of =
economic policies. And the people of Colorado, I think, they're willing to =
make sure that, you know, maybe you disagree with them on this issue or tha=
t issue or they disagree with me on this issue or that issue, but the botto=
m line is this: As long as they believe that their elected official, whethe=
r they're in the House or the Senate, the governor's office, is actually tr=
ying to make progress, trying to move the ball forward, they're going to be=
, they're going to give you the benefit of the doubt. As long as they belie=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: I'm struck by your optimism to that first q=
uestion, and yet, Washington hasn't seen a lot of optimism in the last deca=
de or two. Some of your Republican colleagues, Ted Cruz in the Senate, thos=
e twenty-four House members who voted against Speaker Boehner, they're not =
interested in getting things done as much as they are in putting down marke=
rs. Isn't it more likely there'll be a series of confrontations rather than=
 any kind of collaboration?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: I think everybody's interested in gettin=
g things done. That's why we went here, that's why people ran for Congress =
in the first place. They got elected to actually accomplish things.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

 accomplish, but I believe it is about making a better place here in Washin=
gton, here across the country tomorrow, than it is today.</p>

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: Let me ask you about immigration because th=
at's been a big issue in your state. There are some House Republicans who a=
re proposing now, with the Homeland Security authorization, that they would=
 deny funding for Obama's executive action in November and some would go ev=
en and deny funding for the DREAMer's action in 2012. Is that helpful? Is t=
hat constructive?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: I hope that we, as Republicans, we as De=
mocrats in Congress, instead of just saying no to this or no to that, we ca=
n actually come with a solution to a problem that needs to be addressed. An=
d clearly immigration is one of those issues that we have a problem with. A=
nd it needs to be addressed in this country. Our system isn't working right=
 now, it's broken.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">Just saying no to something, to me, isn't the way=
 that we have to go. I believe we have to do more. I believe what the Presi=
dent did, even the President, himself, has said, was wrong. That he lacked =
the constitutional authority to do it. Just a couple of years ago, time and=
 time again, he said he lacked the legal authority to do what he did and th=
en he turns around and does it.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: But they claim they do have the constitutio=
nal authority.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: Now. I mean, a year ago or two years ago=
 he didn't and now he's saying-</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: But you supported the DREAMers action, didn=
't you?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: I believe that we have to &ndash; that u=
ltimately be part of a solution, but we have to start with a secure border,=
 we have to start with a guest worker program. Those are things that the Am=
erican people support. They want to show, and it be proven, that we can act=
ually handle some of these bigger issues like border security now.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: But do you think it's possible to get some =
kind of an accord that includes some legal status or citizenship for almost=
 all of the eleven million undocumenteds that are here?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: I think at some point that will be one o=
f the solutions that is reached. But right now, Republicans should put forw=
ard a bill that starts with border security, addresses a meaningful guest w=
orker program, because without a workable guest worker program, you do not =
have border security. Let's put those pieces in place, make sure they work,=
 and then we can move forward to additional solutions that are &ndash; that=
 must be a part of the overall fix to immigration.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HUNT: You did well with Latino voters this year, =
for a Republican, you really courted them and you were very aggressive. But=
 the party has a problem. Do you worry that if you don't get this done, tha=
t that problem with Latino voters in the next presidential election is goin=
g to be even greater?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: You know, it's not about voters. It's no=
t about what happens in 2016 or 2018. It's about what happens to our countr=
y. Yeah, I mean, this is about &ndash; our daughter &ndash; our son will so=
on be going to school &ndash; our daughter goes to school with a number of =
people who either parents came here without documentation or they, themselv=
es, are here without documentation. They go to school with our children, th=
ey're in our communities, they've made our country stronger. We, most of us=
, are a nation here because of immigration. And so how do we make these fix=
es that we know are in the best interest of our country?</p>

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

onomy. The report came out Friday morning that we &ndash; 600,000 jobs in t=
he last two months, unemployment down to five, six. We are the envy of the =
world right now. And I guess the question is: Is there any danger Congress =
will screw it up?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GARDNER: Look, never underestimate the ability of=
 Congress to screw something up, so we have to make sure that we change tha=
t, that that doesn't become the norm as it is previous to this. Excited abo=
ut the numbers, however, the labor participation rate still remains about w=
here it was, meaning that there are many Americans out of the workforce who=
 simply have given up looking for work. They're out, they're not working an=
ymore. It's at historic highs, remains at historic highs.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">And I think the key into our economy &ndash; and =
this is part of the people who voted for our campaign, independents, Democr=
ats, who voted for Cory Gardner in November, they've been working harder th=
an ever. Maybe they have two jobs. Maybe they're in the same job. Maybe the=
y're looking for a better-paying job. They've been working harder than ever=
, but for the past ten, fifteen, twenty years, they're earning the same amo=
unt of money. And so, while the haves have more, the have nots have less. T=
hat's really what's wrong with our economy. You scratch the numbers behind =
this economy and what you get to is the unevenness and the fact people are =
suffering.</p>

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

icans will be able to take advantage of, with a few examples being able to =
travel more easily without a special permit, using a credit card in Cuba, a=
nd being allowed to bring back up to $100 in Cuban cigars.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">At only two points in the entire two-minute-and-4=
3-second segment was there any criticism or opposing viewpoint. While intro=
ducing Mitchell&rsquo;s report, anchor Brian Williams stated that <b>&ldquo=
;questions remain over whether Cuba is truly ready for all of this, ready f=
or the influx.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">At the conclusion of her story, Mitchell finally =
brought up the <b>&ldquo;critics&rdquo;</b> of this decision by the Obama a=
dministration: <b>&ldquo;Critics say the President is going too far violati=
ng the embargo and many ask whether Cuba is really ready for the American e=
conomic invasion, especially internet access for all Cubans.&rdquo;</b></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">Fellow broadcast networks ABC and CBS also covere=
d this news, but only in the form of news briefs. On ABC&rsquo;s <i>World N=
ews Tonight</i>, anchor David Muir said that the changes will take place <b=
>&ldquo;just weeks after lifting the embargo in place since the Cold War.&r=
dquo; </b></p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">The problem with that statement, however, is that=
 the embargo technically remains in effect and can only be lifted through a=
n act of Congress. Credit does go out the <i>CBS Evening News</i> for point=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

 she would pull out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that she carried in =
her bag and have coffee.&rdquo; After going into extensive detail about Ken=
nedy&rsquo;s letters to various designers, the CBS reporter concluded his p=

<blockquote>

part. <b>Each lot, some containing 2 to 3 letters is said to be worth $800-=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">NORAH O&rsquo;DONNELL: This morning, we're gettin=
g a rare and revealing look at Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' flair for fashio=
n. Over the decades, the former first lady wrote notes to some of her favor=
ite designers. She even drew sketches of items she wanted. Some of these le=
tters will be auctioned this weekend in West Palm Beach, Florida. Vicente A=
renas gives a preview in a story you&rsquo;ll see only on <i>CBS This Morni=
ng</i>.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">VICENTE ARENAS: Elegant, sophisticated, graceful.=
 Just some of the words that come to mind when describing Jacqueline Kenned=
y Onassis. And her notes to her designer and to her interior decorator show=
 just how closely she cultivated her signature style.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">RICO BACA: We have approximately 30 lots.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: Rico Baca auctioning off Onassis&rsquo; l=
etters on Saturday.<br> <br> BACA: She&rsquo;s inviting these people into h=
er life to get close to her. Close enough to give her what she wanted.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: This was a very private space that she wa=
s letting people into.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BACA: Right. Yes. She would have to be a little b=
it vulnerable.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: No details escaped her eye. Pockets were =
in. Boxy shoulder pads out. That note was for Bill Hamilton, then the desig=
n director for Carolina Herrera.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BILL HAMILTON: If the collection had 90 pieces sh=
e might like 5 suits and we would cut those in different fabrics and colors=
 and there were certain colors she wouldn't want to wear, one of them being=
 black.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: Onassis wrote she was "so sick of seeing =
everyone constantly in black like Mediterranean villages where everyone is =
in mourning for 20 years." She drew this sketch herself which Hamilton then=
 turned into this design. The final product was this brown velvet suit whic=
h made her very excited. Onassis was often very hands-on during the process=
.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">HAMILTON: We would have lunch at my desk and she =
would pull out a peanut butter and jelly sandwich that she carried in her b=
ag and have coffee.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=

 width=3D"300" height=3D"169">ARENAS: Richard Keith Langham decorated sever=
al of Onassis&rsquo; homes.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">RICHARD KEITH LANGHAM: She had a hand in everythi=
ng there. I mean, whether she would be dictating exactly what sort of velve=
t she wanted on a chair, exactly what sort of cording she wanted to trim a =
pillow.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: In one note Onassis told him &ldquo;I was=
n't mad about the black chairs. Too heavy I'm afraid. Do keep looking.&rdqu=
o; But most of the letters, many written in her signature blue stationery w=
ere actually thank-you notes to both men letting them know how happy she wa=
s with the results. She thanked these designers over and over, she was almo=
st humble.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BACA: All these notes are special in the sense th=
at she took the time to sit down and write something in appreciation. It wa=
s -- a thank-you note is a form of respect.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: Onassis had other ways to show she was gr=
ateful.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">LANGHAM: She gave me an original 1963 edition of =
her White House guide book, and she inscribed that to me that &ldquo;perhap=
s this great house will know your touch one day&rdquo; and as a young decor=
ator that was sort of awe-inspiring for me.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: 14 photos taken by Bob Davidoff, a longti=
me photographer for the Kennedy family are also part of the auction. Who wo=
uld want these letters and photographs and sketches?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BACA: You. Wouldn't you want them?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: They&rsquo;d be cool to have at my house.=
</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BACA: Absolutely.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: I can&rsquo;t afford them.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">BACA: Everybody, I mean, I can't imagine anyone w=
ho wouldn't want them.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ARENAS: More than a thousand people are expected =
to take part. Each lot, some containing 2 to 3 letters is said to be worth =
$800-$1200. Although some would probably argue Onassis' gratitude is pricel=
ess. For <i>CBS This Morning</i>, Vicente Arenas, West Palm Beach, Florida.=

<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">GAYLE KING: Such a class act. I was so sorry I ne=
ver got a chance to meet her. You did.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">CHARLIE ROSE: Yes.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">KING: I was very sorry about that. What was she l=
ike, Charlie? I mean really?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">ROSE: Charming and just exciting to talk to. Inte=
resting. Had great insights about...I remember we were sitting and she was =
saying I hope the people that work for Jack won't go into the Clinton gover=
nment, you know? She thought that they should be a new breed of people to c=
ome to work.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">O&rsquo;DONNELL: Did you ever see her pull a pean=
ut butter and jelly sandwich out of her purse?</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
 0; margin-bottom: 10px;">KING: There's something cool knowing that she did=
 that.</p>
<p style=3D"font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6; margin:=
