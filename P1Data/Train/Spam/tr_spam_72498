air of rainbows and a brilliant new star. Soviet records, however, indicate 
he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115
 heights.

they said they believed there would not be significant changes in North 
Korean policies under Kim's son and heir apparent Kim Jong Un until

administration was debating whether to go ahead with a new round of 
nuclear disarmament talks with the North and whether to provide food aid 
to the country, which has been struggling with crippling food shortages.The administration 
had been poised to announce a significant donation of food aid to 
North Korea this week, the first concrete accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes 
diplomatic contacts between the two wartime enemies, according to sources close to 
the negotiations. And, an agreement by North Korea to suspend its controversial 
uranium enrichment program was expected to follow within days, the sources said.Suspension 
of uranium enrichment by North

off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of

his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage
