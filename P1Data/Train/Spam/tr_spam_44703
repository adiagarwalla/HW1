		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 4012470 food.  4012470 service is top notch as well. I had 4012470 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 4012470 size of 4012470 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 4012470 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 4012470 side, but I thought 4012470 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 4012470 spiciness of 4012470 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 4012470 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 4012470 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 4012470 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 4012470 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 4012470 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 4012470 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 4012470 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 4012470 portion was huge and 4012470 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 4012470 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 4012470 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 4012470 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 4012470 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 4012470 prix fixe meal and got 4012470 Tuna "tacos" to start and 4012470 crabcakes as her entree. 4012470 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 4012470 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 4012470 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
