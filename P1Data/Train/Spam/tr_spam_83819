 capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte
eets account for just over 1 percent of all Twitter messages, their 
volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said."Twitter is 
growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail 
Patel, who follows digital media in the region for the research firm 
Informa Telecoms &amp; Media. "The Middle East is an important region for 
Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all Middle East residents 
... because of the Arab Spring protests."Alwaleed is launching a new Arabic 
news channel that will challenge established players such as Qatar's Al-Jazeera and 
Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin 
operations next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg 
LP. Alwaleed has said he hopes the new network will focus on 
the shifts taking place across the Arab world, with an emphasis on 
increased freedom of speech and of the press.KHC also owns a sizable 
er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
