culture icon since she was a teenager.
 life in prison if convicted.In camouflaged fatigues and dark rimmed-glasses, Manning 
sat mostly erect for the third straight day, appearing calm, listening intently 
to the witnesses and occasionally writing on paper in front of him. 
He didn't speak at all Sunday except for the few occasions he 
leaned over to consult with Coombs.Among the material Manning is accused of 
leaking is a military video of a 2007 American helicopter attack in 
Iraq that killed 11 men, including a Reuters news photographer and his 
driver.Fulton testified that sometime before WikiLeaks released a video of attack in 
April 2010, she saw a similar clip on a work station computer 
in Baghdad. She said Manning later showed her that the WikiLeaks clip 
and the one she had seen were the same. Manning is suspected 
of leaking the video.She testified that Manning had a "top secret" security 
clearance, enabling him to view a wide range of classified material. His 
job was to synthesize intelligence f
 capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte

as "general," after having previously only used his official title -- vice-chairman 
of the central military commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, AFP 
reported."The latest move indicates Kim Jong Un is being put forward formally 
as a powerful leader like his father," Sejong Institute analyst Cheong Seong-Chang, 
a specialist in the succession issue, said in October."Such a title has 
been used internally, but North Korea now appears to be boosting the 
image of Jong Un as military leader," he said.Little is known about 
the succession. South Korea's top official on cross-border affairs said last month 
that there would be challenges in transferring power to the son.Kim Jong 
Il's only sister Kim Kyong hui and her husband Jang Song thaek, 
the country's unofficial number two leader, are expected to act as his 
guardian and throw their political weight behind him, analysts say.In a memoir

volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said."Twitter is 
growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail 
Patel, who follows digital media in the region for the research firm 
Informa Telecoms &amp; Media. "The Middle East is an important region for 
Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all Middle East residents 
... because of the Arab Spring protests."Alwaleed is launching a new Arabic 
news channel that will challenge established players such as Qatar's Al-Jazeera and 
Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin 
operations next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg 
LP. Alwaleed has said he hopes the new network will focus on 
the shifts taking place across the Arab world, with an emphasis on 
increased freedom of speech and of the press.KHC also owns a sizable

will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News
