Franco, 33, wound up teaching an NYU course this past fall on

were payback to the actor for hiring one of his other professors,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">seph County Prosecuting Attorney Mike Dvorak into allegations that numerous signatures and 
names on Democratic Party petitions that put then-candidates Barack Obama and Hillary 
Clinton on the primary ballot were forged.Voters have told Fox News that 
their signatures and personal information were fraudulent, and that they never signed 
the petitions that were certified by the St. Joseph County Voter Registration 
Board.U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana David A. Capp has 
previously declined to investigate the allegations, citing a lack of federal jurisdiction."The 
U.S. attorney does not investigate allegations of fraud in the submission of 
petitions by political parties for the placement of the names of candidates 
on the ballot for federal primary elections," Dvorak said in a statement 
in October after discussions with Capp."They do, however, investigate fraud in voter 
registration, the actual voting process, and in the tabulation of ballots."The alle

West Wing, serving as a constant reminder that, for a small percentage 
of Americans, the long, divisive conflict has also been a matter of 
life and death."It's a bit of a gut check on everything you 
say and do about the policy of the war and the politics 
of it," said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communication.The 
end of the nearly nine-year war marked a promise fulfilled for Obama, 
who took office pledging to end the conflict. Mindful of the politics 
of war, some of the veterans who now work for Obama are 
careful not to draw a direct connection between the president's positions on 
the Iraq war and their decision to work for his administration.Still, Steve 
Miska, Obama's director of Iraq policy, said he had "an overwhelming sense 
of relief" when the president announced that the war was coming to 
a close. An Army lieutenant colonel and father of two, Miska did

ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two
