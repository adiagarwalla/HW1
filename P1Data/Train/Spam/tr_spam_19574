sings.Globally, the San Francisco-based company has more than 100 million active users 
who post an average of 250 million messages, or "tweets," a day."We 
believe that social media will fundamentally change the media industry landscape in 
the coming years," Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and 
international investments, said in a statement. "Twitter will capture and monetize this 
positive trend."Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to 
provide further details.Alwaleed owns 95 percent KHC, which has a major stakes 
in Citigroup Inc., Apple Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.His Twitter investment 
comes as Arab activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter 
to coordinate protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes.Arabic is 
now the fastest growing language on Twitter, according to a study released 
last month by French social media research firm Semiocast.Although Arabic tw

campaigner who was arrested at the border while on her way to 
attend a conference in Jordan.Razan Ghazzawi was detained Dec. 4 and charged 
last week with fomenting sectarian strife and spreading false information through a 
secret organization -- charges punishable by up to 15 years in prison.The 
Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, where she worked, said 
in a statement Monday that Ghazzawi was freed Sunday night on bail.It 
said that Ghazzawi would still stand trial at a later, unspecified date.Ghazzawi

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJune 24: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, greet 
supporters at a drive-in hamburger restaurant in Salt Lake City.When Ann Romney 
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, her first concern was whether she would 
be able to take care of her family. But husband Mitt Romney 
said his biggest concern was her survival."If you think about what makes 
a difference to you in your life, it's people," the Republican presidential 
candidate told "Fox News Sunday" in his first Sunday interview in more 
than two years."I'm happy in life as long as I've got my 
soul mate with me," he said.The former Massachusetts governor has often been 
labeled stiff and detached, so much so that his wife was put 
out on the campaign trail with the intent to humanize her candidate 
husband.But Romney said he's actually an "emotional guy" with deep feelings about 
the country and his family. Those emotions were on high when the 
doctors told them in 1998 that Ann was suffering fr
  was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
presidential race for 2012, Rokita warned that officials need to safeguard the 
integrity of the country's electoral process."You really need honest people in both 
parties looking after this process, this process only works when people are 
civically engaged, including party members and party workers who are paid, in 
this case, by the county to make sure the signatures are checked."He 
also suggested that photo ID "would be the stopgap that catches some 
of these things, like ACORN in 2008, when they were filing fraudulent 
voter registrations."Although photo ID, a controversial measure in other states, may not 
have been applicable to petition signatures, the Democratic chairman of St. Joseph 
County has proposed measures intended to prevent any wrong doing in the 
collection of signatures that is underway now.State Sen. John Broden has suggested 
instituting random audits of signatures, a system of verifying their authenticity and 
keeping track of who collected signatu
