iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not 
mentio
 to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of 
Albania's commitment to accountability and the rule of law."A Council of Europe 
report by Swiss politician Dick Marty alleged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army ran detention centers on Albania's border during neighboring Kosovo's war for 
independence from Serbia. It says civilian captives, including Serbs, were killed there 
and their organs sold on the black market.Both Kosovo and Albania have 
denied those allegations.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and

open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney.
