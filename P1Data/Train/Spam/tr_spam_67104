 l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a
 APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
ative," Hurd said. "Victims of cancer could care less about people's politics."A 
statement issued by the Komen Foundation cited criteria for new grant-making and 
ensured there would be no gaps in its assistance."While it is regrettable 
when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such 
as a long-standing partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve 
to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most 
fully advance our mission," the statement said.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
