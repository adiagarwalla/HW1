 ability to absorb nutrients. Your mid level is excess fluid collecting in =
places it shouldn&#39;t be, like your lungs, you also have problems with yo=
ur organs and brain. Your highest level is Water Poisoning, which is really=
 what all these other problems have been but usually doesn&#39;t get mentio=
ned until you are hospitalized. At the very highest level when you get to i=
 ahigher level in life things just progress to another stage to where you d=
o not have the amentinties as you onoce did, with such a vast array of opti=
ons the option become limited.you could have an organ burst, go into a coma=
, or just have all your organs (sudden death) or brain (brain dead) fail.Bo=
th an excess or intolerance of something tends to have the &quot;poisoning&=
quot; tag. If you have too much C you have some type of Poisoning, if you h=
ave too much sun you have Sun Poisoning, if you have too much water you hav=
e Water Poisoning.This has been a serious problem in recent years as chuggi=
ng water, water bottles, and water diets have become popular. There have be=
en a rise in deaths and serious complications from Water Poisoning.. it sho=
t up a few years ago. The reason it&#39;s becoming more well known, unfortu=
nately, isn&#39;t fo the average person damaging themself but for those dea=
ths from contest. One in particular was when a Radio Station held a contest=
, they laughed off the warnings instead of taking them seriously and having=
 contestants clearly read and understand them. The contest was a Pee Holdin=
g contest where they had contestants drink what they were told was more wat=
er then a human could consume in a day. The winner was a struggling single =
mother who wanted the latest game system for her kids. She was functioning =
normally for a couple hours and then was hit with sudden death. I think her=
 type of Water Poisoning involved excess water building up in the brain.It&=
#39;s probably common at this point for a person in the US to drink too muc=
h water. I would like to note that when the airheads came up with recommend=
ed water in a day, that included fluid gained from foods like juicy meats, =
fruits, veggies, cheese, milk, and dessert. A cup is also 8 ounces, which m=
ost people are not aware. This means if you are an average height man they =
think you should get atleast 64 ounces of fluids a day.. but remember... ev=
en cookies contain some fluid. If you have a high fluid diet, you need to b=
alance it out with things like salt or else it will flush nutrients out and=
 seep into places it doesn&#39;t belong. It also will thin your blood, maki=
ng you more prone to illness and take longer to recover from injury. </span=
