d from again occurring by a few lessons like the one which wehave given as =
a specimen. The same means may be taken for crushing therudiments of glutto=
ny, violence, pride, deceit, or any other vice. Thegallery is the proper pl=
ace for these lessons; and after the matterhas been thoroughly _sifted_ in =
the play-ground, or wherever else ithas occurred, the children should then =
be marched to the gallery, toreceive a proper instruction on the subject. C=
ruelty, on the part ofboys, is too prevalent; it is energy, enterprise, and=
 high animalspirit, not legislated for on the part of parents and teachers,=
 whichdescends to cruelty, first to animals, then to all which has life,tha=
t cannot defend itself. Children soon learn to distinguish thosechildren an=
d animals, who can, and will, resent cruelty, from thosewho will not; and t=
herefore, speculate on the results accordingly, andbecome self-taught up to=
 this point. A child should never be without akind and wise guide at this p=
eriod; that which in itself descendsto evil, for the want of a moral guide,=
 may be turned to good. Thefaculties mentioned, cannot be extinguished, but=
 can be regulated.This is the office of the teacher. Too frequently we try =
to crush thepowers that early want training and regulating. The same powers=
 whichrun to vice, may be trained to virtue, but the activities cannot, and=
ought not, to be kept too much in abeyance.Children are not naturally cruel=
, although they differ much in thepropensity to annoy and ce animals an=
d each other under theirindividual control; the passive submit at once, but=
 the energetic willnot; it is then that the active assailant learns an impo=
rtant lesson,which can only be learned in society, and which to him, is of =
greatimportance. The difficulty on the part of the teacher, is to knowwhen =
to interfere, and when to let alone. I have often erred byinterference, of =
this I am quite satisfied; the anxiety to preventevil, has caused me to int=
erfere too soon, by not giving time to thepupil fully to develops his act. =
I hope others will profit from this;it requires much practice and long stud=
y of different temperaments, inchildren, to know when to let alone and when=
 to interfere; but certainit is, that the moral faculties can and must be d=
eveloped, in anysystem worthy of the name ofcation. Other vices beside =
cruelty areto be found in children. Moral training applies to these, and no=
ne areleft to run their own course. Why should they? What are schools for?b=

prevented from again occurring by a few lessons like the one which wehave g=
iven as a specimen. The same means may be taken for crushing therudiments o=
f gluttony, violence, pride, deceit, or any other vice. Thegallery is the p=
roper place for these lessons; and after the matterhas been thoroughly _sif=
ted_ in the play-ground, or wherever else ithas occurred, the children shou=
ld then be marched to the gallery, toreceive a proper instruction on the su=
bject. Cruelty, on the part ofboys, is too prevalent; it is energy, enterpr=
ise, and high animalspirit, not legislated for on the part of parents and t=
eachers, whichdescends to cruelty, first to animals, then to all which has =
life,that cannot defend itself. Children soon learn to distinguish thosechi=
ldren and animals, who can, and will, resent cruelty, from thosewho will no=
t; and therefore, speculate on the results accordingly, andbecome self-taug=
ht up to this point. A child should never be without akind and wise guide a=
t this period; that which in itself descendsto evil, for the want of a mora=
l guide, may be turned to good. Thefaculties mentioned, cannot be extinguis=
hed, but can be regulated.This is the office of the teacher. Too frequently=
 we try to crush thepowers that early want training and regulating. The sam=
e powers whichrun to vice, may be trained to virtue, but the activities can=
not, andought not, to be kept too much in abeyance.Children are not natural=
ly cruel, although they differ much in thepropensity to annoy and ce an=
imals and each other under theirindividual control; the passive submit at o=
nce, but the energetic willnot; it is then that the active assailant learns=
 an important lesson,which can only be learned in society, and which to him=
, is of greatimportance. The difficulty on the part of the teacher, is to k=
nowwhen to interfere, and when to let alone. I have often erred byinterfere=
nce, of this I am quite satisfied; the anxiety to preventevil, has caused m=
e to interfere too soon, by not giving time to thepupil fully to develops h=
is act. I hope others will profit from this;it requires much practice and l=
ong study of different temperaments, inchildren, to know when to let alone =
and when to interfere; but certainit is, that the moral faculties can and m=
ust be developed, in anysystem worthy of the name ofcation. Other vices=
 beside cruelty areto be found in children. Moral training applies to these=
, and none areleft to run their own course. Why should they? What are schoo=
ls for?but to form the virtuous character--the being who can command selfco=
