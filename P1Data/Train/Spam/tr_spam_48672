<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">So this is my official 3 star stamp, I been here twice, once for dinner in June '12 and Christmas eve '14 for their Chinese Xmas 17450018 and I was not blown away by either meal. I am in the minority opinion amongst Yelpers since everyone seems to go gaga over this unkosher restaurant that serves American small plates but simply put, I was disappointed, twice non the less. The meal definitely had some high points, but after the first set of rounds, which were respectable, 17450018 it quickly went down hill after the 5th to 10th plates. If the first round stayed consistent throughout the meal, a 4 star review would apply, but this was not the case. For the food, I will list the order in which the food came out. Also, the service does earn a point of mention since they were so friendly and welcoming and I feel they went above and beyond for my friend who has a soy allergy. They were able to accommodate her and accommodate her well.

The food:

Strawberry-Cinnamon glazed Berkshire 54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4 baby back ribs- Reg menu. This is kind of their go to dish. I ordered this on both visits and truth be told, they were just regular tender ribs, and I also didn't get a strawberry note at all. It also bothered me that the ribs weren't hot but lukewarm. It's a pretty dish but I don't see the hype.

Sweet & Sour pork belly, Korean chile paste, 17450018 quince, pineapple, haricots- Xmas menu. It was a nice dish, it was a sizable dish and the pork belly was tender, but I felt it should have been a little more tender and should have had a tad bit more fat. It didn't have the unctuousness I expect from pork belly. I also wish there was some type of exterior crust on the pork belly. The flavors were good but could have been tweaked.

Lettuce, mac apples, grapes, 17450018 bacon, blue cheese, sunflower, pomegranate- Reg menu. This dish stood throughout the night as my favorite dish. It seems absurd for me to enjoy salad so much, but it was a testament to how great the salad was. The salad was so wonderfully sweet and savory. The greens were dressed properly, the apples offered a nice crunch, the grapes and pomegranate added a wonderful sweetness and there was a amazing underlying blue cheese note throughout the salad that was fantastico. And crispy bacon needs no mention lol.54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4
