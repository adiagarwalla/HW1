own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces
igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration 
officers ba

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">the report investigating allegations of abuse dating back to 1945.The commission received 
some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s
 hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving 
heart for people. He was 
ocrat and a 44-year-old truck driver, who voted for Obama in 2008 
and intends to support him again.Robin Dein, a 54-year-old homemaker, who is 
an independent, said she supported Republican John McCain in 2008 and has 
not been impressed with Obama's economic policies. She intends to support Romney 
if he wins the Republican nomination."(Obama) spent the first part of his 
presidency blaming Bush for everything, not that he was innocent, and now 
his way of solving anything is by spending more money," she said.Despite 
the soft level of support, many are uncertain whether a Republican president 
would be a better choice. Asked whom they would support next November, 
47 percent of adults favored Obama compared with 46 percent for Romney, 
a former Massachusetts governor. Against Gingrich, the president holds a solid advantage, 
receiving 51 percent compared with 42 percent for the former leader of 
the House.The potential matchups paint a better picture for the president am
