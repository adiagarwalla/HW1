APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or 
less and those with grad

PHILADELPHIA  Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the retired head of the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia and an uncharged central figure in a child sex-abuse case that 
involves the alleged shuffling of predator priests to unwitting parishes, has died.
