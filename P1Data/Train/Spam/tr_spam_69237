newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The

APNov. 6, 2011: Demonstrators march with a replica of a pipeline during 
a protest to demand a stop to the Keystone XL tar sands 
oil pipeline in Washington, D.C.A senior House GOP aid tells Fox News 
that the House is opposed to the payroll tax deal passed in 
the Senate that includes provisions regarding a proposed Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline.The aid 
says House Republicans oppose the bill because they believe it will impose 
more hardships on the already struggling middle class.They may seek to amend 
the Senate bill.These comments only give further uncertainty to the future of 
the pipeline, which was addressed in the bowels of the $33 billion 
package passed by the Senate Saturday. The bill would extend the payroll 
tax cut as well as unemployment aid, and includes a tricky provision 
that would require President Obama to decide in 60 days whether to
