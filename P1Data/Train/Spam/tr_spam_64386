 tall, weighing 30 pounds. She has blonde hair. She was last 
seen wearing green one-piece pajamas with polka dots and the words "Daddy's 
Princess" on them. She had a soft cast on her left arm. 
Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the 
table," he said. "We have not uncovered any information that has sent 
us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is 
scled for 2 p.m.Waterville is 
okeswoman said the U.S. does not discuss "specific security posture, but commanders 
continually assess the current force protection status and make adjustments as needed."Obama 
spoke with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak overnight Monday, according to the 
White House, to reaffirm "the United States' strong commitment to the stability 
of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally."National security 
officials will stay in close coordination as the situation develops, the White 
House said. In a separate statement, Press Secretary Jay Carney said the 
U.S. is also staying in touch with Japan.According to a "special broadcast" 
by state media in Pyongyang late Sunday, Kim died Saturday of a 
heart ailment while on a train due to "great mental and physical 
strain" during a "high intensity field inspection." North Korea will hold a 
national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's funeral will be held on 
Dec. 28, the report said.But in a demonstration of son

Nancy Pelosi to back climate change policy"The speaker said this is right-wing 
social engineering. Talk about unreliable. At a critical time, he cut the 
legs out from underneath a very important message."Romney said he also stands 
by his description of Gingrich as "zany.""And zany, I don't think you 
would call mirrors in space to light highways at night particularly practical, 
or a lunar colony a practical idea, not at a stage like 
this," he said.On Saturday, the Des Moines Register announced it was endorsing 
Romney for the GOP nomination. Gingrich on Sunday said he's fine with 
that arrangement since he already won the endorsement of the Manchester, N.H., 
Union Leader."I'm actually delighted because the Manchester Union Leader, which is a 
reliably conservative newspaper, endorsed me. The Des Moines Register, which is a 
solidly liberal newspaper, did not endorse me. I think that indicates who

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">, Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.
 ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
n 3,000 people, were holding out hope that a new buyer would 
emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su
