Their menu consists of a large rectangular piece of paper 6696297 (I forget if its laminated or not; my time spent waiting at my table for people to arrive was not productive at all) with a list of all the different Southern style dishes available. You can order things in different sizes, so I opted to shared with my friend. We went for the pulled chicken, and the rice and red beans.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When I go out to eat, I want to order a lot of the menu and share with everyone I'm with. At Brasa, this is not only possible, but encouraged.

Going to school six hours from my hometown, 6696297 my parents rarely get the chance to visit me. Growing up with two foodies, I knew I had to bring my A-game during their recent pick-me-up (no, really, they picked me up to take me home...). Never having been to Brasa, but always hearing great things, I decided to take them to the Southern side of Northeast. Brasa did not disappoint. 

We ordered the fried plantains and yucca, along with the roasted yams with Andouille sausage for starters. The minute the yams came out (we ordered a medium for three people), I thought, "oh no... 6696297 This isn't going to be enough," but the richness allowed you to only eat a little of it, and it ended up being the perfect size. For main dishes, we went with the beef, collard greens, jalape??o and grits bowl along with the lime slow roasted pork. Epiphany: I need more grits in my life. It was like a bowl of happiness, and with the pork as a complimentary second entree, it was as if I discovered butcher heaven. I'm incredibly anxious to try their pulled chicken next - I can only imagine good things coming from that.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b 

Like parents like child, however, we didn't just stop at savory - no, we went all in and ordered dessert: their Buttered Tin Bakery pumpkin pie and their in-house chocolate cake with chocolate sauce. The most important lesson I learned from this was to never judge a dessert menu by its genericly-named items. 6696297 The pumpkin pie had some of the best consistency I've ever tasted, and the chocolate cake was rich and satisfyingly superior to the basic Applebee's-esque lava cake I expected (sorry, Applebee's...). Three sides, two entrees, and two dessers were perfect for three [very hungry] people, and we still hadn't ordered everything on the menu. 

If you live by the true (albeit clich??) statement "sharing is caring," check Brasa out. And if you don't, they have single-serving portions as well, so you have no excuse.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b
