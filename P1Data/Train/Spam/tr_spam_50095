 (AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
 Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
 APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for
