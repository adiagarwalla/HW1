<p style="font-size:xx-small;">choose between two of the party's core constituencies: environmentalists who oppose Keystone 
and some unions who covet the jobs it would produce.But McConnell and 
other Republicans say the project would create thousands of jobs. The company's 
developer, TransCanada, says it could produce up to 20,000 jobs, while critics 
say the figure would be fewer than 3,500, including less than 1,000 
that would be permanent.After passing the catchall spending bill House leaders sent 
their members home until Monday or later, planning to return when the 
Senate produces a payroll tax cut measure for the House to vote 
on.The way was smoother for the compromise spending bill, which passed on 
a 296-121 vote. It would fund 10 Cabinet-level departments, such as the 
Pentagon and the Department of Education, and dozens of smaller agencies. It 
would finance everything from U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to veterans' 
services, and from airport security inspections to Congress' o
 BRUSSELS -- European Union officials say that a first draft of a 
new treaty setting up tighter budget rules for eurozone countries has been 
sent to governments Friday.The officials said that formal discussions on the new 
treaty with delegates from the national governments will start next Tuesday, with 
a second round of talks scled for the first week of January. 
The officials declined to be named in line with the EU's briefing 
policy.The U.K., which was the only European country which has refused to 
sign up to the new intergovernmental treaty, will have observer status in 
the talks.The new rules will apply to eurozone states once nine of 
the 17 have ratified it, while participating non-euro states can decide whether 
they want to submit to the new rules.
 training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
