APDec. 17, 2011: Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 
greets supporters during a town hall meeting at Memminger Auditorium in Charleston, 
S.C.Anticipating attacks from Democrats who intend to portray him as a greedy 
capitalist, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Sunday it's unfortunate -- but 
not surprising -- that President Obama's reelection strategy aims to demonize success 
and target job creators."Of course he will, in part because he's been 
the great divider. This is the president who goes after anybody who's 
successful," Romney said.Speaking to "Fox News Sunday" in his first interview on 
a Sunday news show in two years, the former Massachusetts governor and 
head of venture capital firm, Bain Capital, said Democrats are already casting 
him as Gordon Gecko, the antihero in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" movies 
who famously delivered the line "greed is good."But Romney said entrepreneurs aren't 
heartless Sc
 were sliding down. I thought I could fight my way back 
up to being in the top three or four," said Gingrich, now 
a front-runner for the nomination. "But I think positive ideas and positive 
solutions... have attracted people. I think they like the idea of someone 
who's determined to be positive."
ey went to pay overhead -- for staff, for other things. It 
didn't go directly to me. It went to the company that provided 
consulting advice."Romney also went after Gingrich's repeated insistence that he never lobbied 
Congress after he stepped down as speaker."I'm going to let the lawyers 
decide what is and what is not lobbying, but when it walks 
like a duck and quacks like a duck, typically it's a duck," 
Romney said.Other candidates focused their campaigns on Iowa, which holds its leadoff 
caucuses Jan. 3.Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Gov. Rick Perry were 
on bus tours through rural Iowa. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum stuck 
to a plan that has won him the honor of spending the 
most time in the state, yet has not yet translated into support 
in polls.Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has a loyal following among his 
party's libertarian wing, worked to build momentum and organization in Iowa, although 
he did not have public events scled until midweek.
