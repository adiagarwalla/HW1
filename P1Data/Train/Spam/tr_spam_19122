        It's occurred to me that this character =FF=FF=FF often together wit=
h another character forms words with very positive meanings, such as =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. At the same time, the cha
racter can also form very negative words, such as =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. I'm curious a
s to how the same character is associated with the two opposite extremes (Ye=
s, =FF=FF=FF itself can mean "rotten" or "brilliant"). Is there any explanat=
ion for this? If there is, I'd
 like to hear, as this should be quite interesting .=20

        To my understanding, "=FF=FF=FF" is something =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF no matter it is good or bad. "=FF=FF=FF" delivers to m=
e such extreme feelings and explosive feelings. In a phrase, it is lik
e an adjective word, and the other word is of more importance. "=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF" "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
". in such phrases, the word "=FF=FF=FF" is just to describe the degree of "=
=FF=FF=FF" and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF.=20

        I think you're right there, name my name! If "=FF=FF=FF" is seen as =
denoting some extreme, then that explains how "=FF=FF=FF" can work well in t=
he two opposite extremes=20

        1. In contemporary Chinese, "=FF=FF=FF" seems to exhibit bipolar cha=
racteristic only when it is used in multi-syllable morphemes (examples liste=
d in post #1). Are there situa
tions where the single syllable morpheme "=FF=FF=FF" is used with positive c=
onnota
tion? I can't think of any. It looks like the standalone "=FF=FF=FF" lost th=
at bipolar trait.


        2. I'm not sure about other regions, in Singapore, "=FF=FF=FF" is a =
very versatile word and we used it very loosely to mean "sucks" (as in "it s=
ucks"). E.g. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF / =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF /
 =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF Do=
 you used it the same ways?=20

        From examples given by Skatinginbc, it appears his explanation makes=
 the most sense to me. namemyname=FF=FF=FFs theory contradicts with most dic=
tionaries: 'extreme' is only on
e possible (and less frequent) usage of =FF=FF=FF. It is not hard to see how=
 the m
eaning of =FF=FF=FF evolved: brilliance from fire -> (over)burned/destroyed =
by fire -> decomposed/broken -> bad=20

        May I add "bad -> extreme"? It is a common semantic transition, for =
instance, English terrible "very bad" -> "very serious, extreme"; awful "bad=
 or unpleasant" -> "ext
remely, very".

        You are right. =FF=FF=FF, if standalone, is rarely a positive term i=
n Modern Chinese although it was originally attested as a monosyllabic morph=
eme with a positive meaning (e
.g., =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF). I think the reason is to ce=
 confusion. As time went by,
 =FF=FF=FF gradually adopted newer meanings. To avoid confusion, the older m=
eanings are expressed through idiomatic expressions =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF (e.g.=
, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF "pure silver" or =
"shiny lik

ynonym (e.g., =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF), which=20
specifies the meaning or interpretation of =FF=FF=FF. In other word, the anc=
ient positive =FF=FF=FF becomes restricted in its innovative uses.=20

        What you are discussing is really an interesting phenomenon, and de =
facto incurs my further thought about the slow and significant process of th=
e constructing of our s
emantic system.

        First, I want to reply to skatinginbc that the two polar opposite me=
aning signified by =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFsick=FF=FF=FF both in English =
and Chinese, is not really what I am going to talk ab
out. I am sticking to the sort of phenomenon represented by the first threa
d. =FF=FF=FFThe principle of the mean=FF=FF=FF is an universal creed underst=
andable to every races, and admits of being accepted by any others. Anything=
 that goes too far in one direction wil
l turn toward its opposite. So there is no transformation of meaning in the
 usage of sick or other family similar words. If you are too bold, that you =
dare to fight a lion without any training and armament, people would say you=
 are crazy, sick, fooli
sh=FF=FF=FF, although it may be a display of overwhelming spiritedness. Neve=
r would
 a prudent man say that you are courageous, for there is a limit put for hum=
an beings, out of which no human excellence will be connected with you.

        Now I am going to put forth my own thought triggered by this thread.=
 The building up of Chinese(just take Chinese as an example), is accompanied=
 by the process of the=20
development of its culture. In ancient China, approximately the Neolithic a
ge, as held by most scholars, the tribes are ruled by its priests (as also s=
trongly advocated by The Golden Bough, and other dominating schools of the h=
istorians and anthropol
ogists). The writing system are innovated by the priest class to be used to
 record the history of its tribes , and most of all, to worship gods. So mos=
t of the written characters must be related to high-sounding things, like he=
aven, moon, gods, light
, splendor, glory, honor, beauty. Later on when the need of the expansion o
f the semantic system arises, lots of them are borrowed to refer to other vu=
lgar things. This suits to the transition of the meaning of =FF=FF=FFfrom th=
e definition I to the definiti
on II. =FF=FF=FF may be used to represent an image of the morning sun, dazzl=
ing an
d radiating, but people finally find it relevant to a boiled food, which is =
disintegrating, forming an image of radiation, and is very similar to some f=
ruit exposed too long t
o the spectacular (=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF)sunlight.=20
</style>
<dir style=3D"color:white; font-size:0.0
    Another very important event is that the political structure takes shape=
 gradually, at first, they try their best to integrate the dotted-living peo=
ple, and manage public=20
affairs, tackle with lawsuits or disputes. The word =FF=FF=FF is just used t=
o desc
ribe the effort of the Great Pontifex or Great Emperor to create order among=
 citizens. But as time wears on, they are aware that the interference of the=
 supreme governor on ma
ny fields is not beneficial at all. So a doctrine names as the rule of no i
nterference(=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF) comes to the fore, and som=
ehow people starts using =FF=FF=FF to indicate a chaotic situation, because =
most of the administration and management measures are dee
med as counter-productive. In the later usage of =FF=FF=FF, people almost ha=
ve for
gotten that it was to mean order and beauty.

    Until now, all the examples show that words can changed from blight side=
 to a dark side. Now let us see the opposite situation. =FF=FF=FFis original=
ly to mean wage a war or fight
 against someone or some other city, which is another vindication that lots
 of words spring from political life. But they goes on to find that when at =
war with others , we are in the process of understanding them. So =FF=FF=FF =
now gets new meanings which ar
e to learn, and to treat it in a reasonable way, to tease out. Another simi
lar example is =FF=FF=FF, its ancient form depicts an image in which a man u=
tilize his arm to catch a heavy object, so referring to military power.(=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF) But hundreds of years=20
later, it shows up in texts to mean measure up or weigh up, because they ar
e conscious that the power or strength used to fight can also be used to wei=
gh up things, and that they need to do that now for the matter of exchange o=
r other reasons. Since=20
then, =FF=FF=FF can carry good meaning,=FF=FF=FF is a very important wisdom =
of the ancien
t sophists.=20

    When a word is ambiguous between a negative and a positive meaning, who'=

an entry in a dictionary, the positive sense of the character is recorded.=20=

Offhand, I can think of Wenlin dictionary being one but there are no doubt o=

    Personally I don't think in a modern speech =FF=FF=FF when stands alone =
by itself will be taken to mean "brilliant" which is almost always used comb=
ining other characters, which=20
is why I suspect they are inseparable, e.g. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF don't make sense
.=20
