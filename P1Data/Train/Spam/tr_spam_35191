o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDec. 16: Colton Harris-Moore, also known as the 'Barefoot Bandit' glances at 
the courtroom gallery as he walks to the defense table, in Island 
County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and 
distressed people ... They didn't know if they came back from vacation 
their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total 
of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, thef
  heights.
lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
