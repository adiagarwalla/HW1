The following is a list of President Obama's "evolving" statements on same-sex 
marriage."I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such 
marriages." -- Obama's answer in a questionnaire during his 1996 run for 
Illinois state Senate "Undecided" -- his answer in another questionnaire on the 
same-sex marriage question during his re-election race for the same office in 
1998"I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am 
not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about 
primarily just as a strategic issue." -- Obama's response during an interview 
with the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper, in February 2004"I believe 
that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, 
for me as a Christian ... it is also a sacred union." 
-- Obama's response in April 2008 during a presidential campaign forum"I have 
been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily 
because of my understa

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going 
to create more suffering
 bvioulsy this position may put us at odds with others, but when 
we think about our faith, the thing at root (is) not just 
Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, but the golden rule, treat others the 
way you want to be treated."Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this 
report.

 to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday,
