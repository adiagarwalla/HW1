Hi dale, 
We believe that to be the best leader you can be, you need to be a fearless, bold, effective coach on a daily basis. Aspirational, right?  
The path to greatness seldom runs smoothly though, so in this white paper, we'll discuss a few strategies to get you started. 
Strategies for being a better manager:

     Talk less, listen more 
    Play to your (and your team's) strengths 
    Manage teams, not individuals 
    Accentuate the positive 

 Being a good manager is tough enough. To make all the difference, choose tools that were developed to support people, provide organizational insight and drive performance. 
 To learn more about these strategies and several others, download this guide today. 
Best Regards,
Henry Thomas
