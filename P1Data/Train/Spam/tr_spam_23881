<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Ive been wanting to go to Little Beast ever since I saw them open and my bf and I finally got a chance to go. 

The ambiance is AMAZING! 21836072 It felt like I was visiting a hipster chef's cute little hipster house. 

The service and attention to detail was insanely good. Everyone was friendly, servers were great and knowledgeable and my water glass was never empty (which is a big pet peeve of mine). The part that I sold me the most when I somehow accidentally blew out the candle at our table and was bummed that it was out. 21836072 Less than 5 minutes later, one of the servers (or the owner? the dude with the handle bar 'stash) came over and replaced it with a lit one!  I love when they pay attention to the smallest details. I also really liked that there patio was full of standing heaters esp since it was a very cold night in LA when I went.

The 2 parts I was let down on... the food and the prices. 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 On Yelp it says its "$$" place... My bf and I ordered the braised chicken, flat iron steak, chicken liver mousse and 1 coke (which was bottled aka no free refills) and  I had filtered tap water and it came out to about $60 before tip! I know we both make decent enough money and it definitely didnt break the bank but we weren't planning on spending that much on a random Thursday night out. So maybe they should adjust their Yelp rating to accurately reflect their pricing... Or maybe since the food was just okay I just couldnt justify the prices. :
The food was good... 21836072 But not amazing. My chicken was okay, nothing to really brag about. My bf's steak was definitely better than my chicken in terms of taste and looks (I knew I got the wrong dish when I saw them bring his plate out) but still not amazing. For the amount we paid, I was expecting to be blown out of the water by the food they served. I will say that the chicken liver mousse was pretty phenomenal.. I was the only one that ate it since my bf doesn't eat liver or meat mousse which I was happy about because I scraped the jar it came in because it was so good! I did like that they provided free extra toasted bread when I ran out but still had mousse left to eat.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
