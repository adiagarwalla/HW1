10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will

DAMASCUS, Syria  Two suicide car bombs ripped through the Syrian capital 
Thursday, killing 55 people and tearing the facade off a military intelligence 
building in the deadliest explosions since the country's uprising began 14 months 
ago, the Interior Ministry said.Residents told an Associated Press reporter that the 
blasts happened in quick succession during morning rush hour, with an initial 
small explosion followed by a larger bomb that appeared aimed at onlookers 
and rescue crews arriving at the scene. Paramedics wearing rubber gloves collected 
human remains from the pavement as heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks 
smoldered.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's blasts. But an al-Qaida-inspired

55 dead, the ministry also said there were 15 bags of human 
remains, meaning the death

the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the

arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a
