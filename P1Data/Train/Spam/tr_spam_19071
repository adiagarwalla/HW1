 movement, advocating constitutional reform and arguing landmark cases to defend property 
rights and political and religious dissenters. Convicted in 2006 of subversion and 
sentenced to three years, he was quickly released on probation before being 
taken away by security agents in 2009 in the first of his 
forced disappearances that set off an international outcry.The Xinhua report referred to 
his 2006 subversion conviction and said Beijing's No. 1 Intermediate People's Court 
found that Gao "had seriously violated probation rules for a number of 
times, which led to the court decision to withdraw the probation."The report 
did not explain what violations Gao had committed but said his five-year 
probation was due to expire next Thursday -- timing which legal experts 
said may have prompted the government to send Gao back to jail. 
"He would serve his term in prison in the next three years," 
the report said.Calls to the No. 1 court and the city's appeals 
court rang u
own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  A Nebraska meatpacker recalled more than 40,000 pounds of ground 
beef products distributed in 16 states after a test confirmed the presence 
of E. coli, the Agriculture Department said Friday.The products were shipped to 
institutions and distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., recalled 10-pound chubs of 
chuck fine ground beef 80/20, packed in cases containing eight chubs.USDA's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement that the problem was 
discovered through routine monitoring that confirmed a positive result for E. coli. 
No reports of illness have been received.E. coli is a bacterium that 
can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in the most severe cases, kidney 
failure. The very young, the elderly and those with weak immune systems 
are t
 o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
vershadowed a nationwide campaign to urge Egyptians to buy locally-made goods.Despite the 
protests, the military retains widespread support among many Egyptians who see it 
as the only entity able to run the country until presidential elections 
scled for next year.Images of troops protecting polling centers and soldiers carrying 
the elderly to the polls have served to boost the military's image 
as guardians of the country.
