oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

WAGA-TVChurch members who survived describe the horror of the multi-vehicle crash on 
northbound I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Members of a small Brazilian church outside Atlanta 
are trying to find ways to pay for bringing the bodies of 
members killed in a deadly Florida interstate pileup back to Georgia and 
then, hopefully, on to their native country to bury them.The congregation is 
mourning the death of a pastor, his wife, their daughter and two 
others in the horrific crash that killed 11 people Sunday on northbound 
I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Pastor Jose Carmo Jr. of the Church of the 
Restoration in Marietta and his wife, Adrianna, died in the crash. Also 
killed were their daughter, Leticia, Jose Carmo's brother, Edson, and his brother's 
girlfriend, Rose."It was like everything was clear, then suddenly you got inside 
of darkness, smoke," Marcia Silva, a church member who survived the crash, 
told Fox affiliate WAGA-TV.One church member injured in the pileup, 15-ye
New York Police DepartmentJanuary 31, 2012: Scene of raid on Bronx building 
that contained 600 marijuana plants.NEW YORK  Cops raided a New York 
apartment building Tuesday and found it had been turned into a pot 
farm.Acting on a tip, police broke down the door at 610 Morris 
Park Avenue in The Bronx at 1:00 p.m. local time and discovered 
a staggering 600 marijuana-growing pots. They filled the top four floors of 
the five-story building.Officials estimated there was 1,500 pounds of pot growing in 
the building, and at $5,000 a pound, it had a street value 
of about $7.5 million.Cops also found there had modifications to the ventilation 
of the building and other changes."It was like a pot farm in 
there," one law enforcement source said. "They were using enough electricity, grow 
lights and such to power an entire city block."Three suspects in their 
20s were arrested on drug dealing and drug possession charges.Click for more

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index

those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered 
 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn
