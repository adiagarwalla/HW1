ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer
A Connecticut man accused of hacking a homeless man to death and 
eating part of his brain was due to be arraigned Wednesday on 
a murder charge, the Connecticut Post reported.Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, is accused 
of killing Angel "Tun Tun" Gonzalez with an ax last December and 
removing the man's eyeballs and part of his brain.Smith, of Ansonia, is 
said to have consumed the dismembered organs in a local cemetery at 
the site of his cousin's grave.Gonzalez's mutilated body lay undiscovered until January, 
when it was found inside a vacant apartment in Bridgeport, Conn., 65 
miles northeast of New York City.Smith was arrested last month in Lynn 
Haven, Fla., where he was held on $1 million bond, until police 
escorted him back to Bridgeport on Tuesday.The suspected cannibal, who is believed 
to have a history of mental health problems, faces up to 60 
years in jail if convicted in Bridgeport Superior Court on Wednesday morning.Smith 
had warned his cousin, Nicole Rabb, tha
ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">PHILADELPHIA  Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, championing the Vatican line on 
homosexuality and abortion but later coming under fire by two grand juries 
investigating child sex abuse allegations, has died. He was 88.Bevilacqua died in 
his sleep Tuesday night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, a 
Philadelphia suburb, after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after 
lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in 
the upcoming trial of
 APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

should be telling other folks to get out of the race and 
get out of my way. If you want to run a race, 
run a race, you don't ask someone to quit just because because 
you think you're the better candidate. I think I'm the better candidate 
but Newt has every right to run," he said.
