Can't wait toshowyou! SO SO SO excited!!!! Xxo."TMZ broke the story that 
Trawick had planned to ask for Britney's hand in marriage during their 
trip to Vegas, and the smart money was that it was all 
supposed to go down tonight. But it seems that he just couldn't 
wait.Click here to follow FOX411 on Facebook and Twitter.Sources close to the

 BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters
