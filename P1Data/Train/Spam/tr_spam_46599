APIn this Oct. 16, 2011, file photo, Chicago Bears wide receiver Sam 
Hurd (81) rushed between Minnesota Vikings defenders during the second half of 
an NFL football game in Chicago.CHICAGO  A federal judge in Chicago 
has set bond at $100,000 for former Bears wide receiver Sam Hurd, 
who was cut from the team Friday after being charged with trying 
to set up a drug-dealing network.At a hearing Friday, Judge Young Kim 
also ordered Hurd, 26, to surrender his passport and any firearms. Hurd 
must pay all of the $100,000 to be released. He'll be tried 
in Texas, where the drug charges originate.Hurd was arrested Wednesday night in 
Chicago after authorities said he agreed to buy a kilogram of cocaine 
from an undercover agent.Hurd is accused of trying to buy up to 
10 kilograms of cocaine and a half-ton of marijuana on a weekly 
basis to sell in the Chicago area. He was allegedly seeking to 
buy the drugs through a co-conspirator in the Dallas area, who had 
been negotiatin
VATICAN CITY -- Pope Benedict XVI warned Friday that respect for human 
dignity "is seriously threatened" by concerns over profit, utility and material possessions.At 
a time when the economic crisis is causing a "rising sense of 
frustration" in society, young people need to becated on the ethical 
needs for achieving justice and peace, he said.The pope expressed his concerns 
in an annual written message for the church's celebration of its World 
Day of Peace on Jan. 1, saying "it seems as if a 
shadow has fallen over our time, preventing us from clearly seeing the 
light of day."But he said he is convinced that the young "with 
their enthusiasm and idealism, can offer new hope to the world."At the 
same time, Benedict urged political leaders to give young people "a transparent 
image of politics as a genuine service to the good of all."He 
said that despite "the profession of good intentions, the value of the 
person, of human dignity and human rights is seriously t
WASHINGTON  The last American prisoner in Iraq, a Hezbollah commander linked 
to the kidnapping deaths of four U.S. soldiers, was turned over to 
the Iraqi government Friday, the White House said.U.S. officials have long feared 
that such a transfer would lead to Ali Mussa Daqduq's release from 
prison. But his case became enmeshed in both international diplomacy and the 
Washington political debate over how best to prosecute suspected terrorists.Under President George 
W. Bush, prosecutors had planned to someday charge Daqduq in a U.S. 
criminal court. But those plans were scrapped after Obama took office and 
lawmakers began restricting the president's ability to bring terrorist suspects into the 
United States for trial.Many Republicans had wanted Daqduq prosecuted before a military 
tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba. The Obama administration had 
hoped a compromise would be to prosecute Daqduq in a first-of-its-kind military 
commission on U.S. soil.But the Ir

 s request.When contacted by FoxNews.com, DoE spokesman Damien LaVera declined to comment.However, 
climate change researcher and blogger Steve McIntyre forwarded FoxNews.com an email exchange 
from 2005 in which climate scientist Warwick Hughes asked an official at 
a DOE lab if he could get the data that the government 
paid Jones to collect."I am asking you to provide me with the 
following data  DoE has been funding [the data] since the 1980s," 
Hughes noted in his request.But Tom Boden, of the DOE's Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, told Hughes at the time that the DOE itself did 
not have the data, and that "you will need to contact Phil 
[Jones] directly. I spoke today with the DOE program manager who indicated 
Phil was not obligated under the conditions of past or present DOE 
proposal awards to provide these items."McIntyre said he himself later had a 
similar exchange with the DOE, after which "I suggested that they amend 
this as a condition of further financing."
providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears. 
Youll truly feel like youre on top of the Buri Khalifa with 
Cruise.Hope youre not afraid of
