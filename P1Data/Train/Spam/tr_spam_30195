ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat
Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i

and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly

physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
 in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding 
to the co
