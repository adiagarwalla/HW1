 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
ause of "great worry" and said he would urge China once more 
to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be 
the most prominent government critic to be
blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">PHOENIX  An Arizona prosecutor planned no immediate action to address federal 
government concerns that Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office committed widespread constitutional violations and 
discrimination against Latinos, saying Friday that the U.S. Justice Department report wouldn't 
be taken at "face value."Instead, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery criticized Homeland 
Security Secretary Janet Napolitano's decision to stop Arpaio from checking inmates' immigration 
status and argued it would allow criminals to be released into the 
community. Montgomery said he was asking President Barack Obama to order the 
restoration of access to federal systems revoked Thursday.The Obama administration action came 
after the Justice Department determined Arpaio's office participated in a "systematic disregard" 
for the Constitutional rights of Latinos while targeting illegal immigrants, bringing the 
most bruising criticism yet to the lawman's boundary-pushing foray into Arizona's imm
 lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach 
the island. Officers struggled after a boat broke down because it
