WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state 
backed him in 2008 but voted solidly Tuesday to ban gay marriag
 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee 
 t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from 
FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby,
