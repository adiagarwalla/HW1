Dear Jeanette
Recently I received a really great email. It read:
&nbsp;
&quot;Hello Mike

Just wanted to let www.love-match-dating.co.uk know that I met my now
husband on your site in 2009. I was initially skeptical about online dating
as you hear so many horror stories! For us however it has worked out :)

Thanks for a super site

Emmaline&quot;

I hope you have equally good fortune on www.love-match-dating.co.uk
