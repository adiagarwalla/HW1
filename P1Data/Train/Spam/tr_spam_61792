Hi Marie, 
Traditional IT architectures have been typically based on silos, with computing resources dedicated to specific applications and over-resourcing to accommodate peak demands and potential future growth.
    Virtualization systems have been replacing these silos with a layer of shared resources, multiplexed among dynamic workload demands. This consolidation of resources and workloads has resulted in dramatic productivity gains, improving the efficiency of IT infrastructure  and application performance, while cing IT costs. 
  However, virtualization leads to new operations management challenges, beyond the scope of traditional paradigms. 
  In this white paper, we'll describe VMTurbo's supply chain economy approach, which uniquely addresses these virtualization requirements.
