s.com. Variances in temperature, humidity and light continue to age the parchment, 
so there are strict rules about how much time the documents can 
be illuminated. The last time the Ten Commandments scroll was exhibited in 
Toronto, Canada, in 2009, it was restricted to just 80 hours of 
public viewing.Tatiana Treiger, a conservator with the Israel Antiquities Authority, is personally 
handling the installation of the scroll and will watch over it during 
its time in New York. "Our job is a lot like a 
doctor's: do no harm," Treiger said.The story of how the Ten Commandments 
were conveyed to Moses by God on stone tablets is not recorded 
in this scroll. The stone tablets themselves were supposedly held in the 
Ark of the Covenant, as famously depicted in Hollywood movies, such as 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.Somewhat less spectacularly, the scroll is simply a 
copy of those commandments. But its very existence -- the scroll dates 
from about 30 B.C. and survived for thousand

of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis

 FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach
