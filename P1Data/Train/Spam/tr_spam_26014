to play with Southwestern flavors so naturally and creatively, elevate it to gourmet level, and yet maintain its authentic homey quality? He is 21461696 most down-to-earth of all 21461696 talented celebrity chefs, and you can feel it in his food. 21461696 restaurant is another story... It's wonderfully trendy and fun, very colorful. 21461696 ambience feels more like a fancy bar, but I love it. We came here to start a night that ended at PURE; a really good way to start your night, it has a great energy. If you're in Vegas and thinking of trying this place, stop thinking and just eat here! We came without reservations on a busy Friday night. 21461696 wait was very long, but they were accommodating and offered to serve us in 21461696 bar area. 21461696 bar tables are pretty small, and could barely fit our party of four. But 21461696 food made up for everything. This is a small restaurant ladies and gentlemen, and it gets PACKED! So please, do yourselves a favor and make a RESERVATION. I had 21461696 ancho-chile marinated salmon, and 21461696 cilantro mashed potatoes. 21461696 red-sauce basted salmon came plated atop a green tomatillo sauce and a black bean sauce. Did I mention i love sauces?! Everything was very flavorful, which makes me happy, but all well-balanced. 21461696 cilantro mashed potatoes were my FAV, I'm a big fan of cilantro. 21461696 best part....wait for it...all 21461696 recipes are available on 21461696 food network website, so you can make Bobby's dishes at home! I'm not sure if they will come out as good, though. I will be making this salmon (with 21461696 sauces) at
