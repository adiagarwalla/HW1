in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.
ck in Arpaio's jails to make sure criminal aliens are identified. They 
pointed to a statement Napolitano issued Thursday saying federal resources would be 
used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) 
immigration enforcement priorities."But Montgomery said there was no issue raised by the 
Justice Department about misuse of the federal authority and the county should 
be allowed to continue checking jailed suspects for immigration violations. Arizona law 
requires that illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes be held without bond, 
and losing that authority could lead to people being released who should 
be held.Montgomery also questioned the timing of the Justice Department's findings, because 
a civil rights case that raises similar issues is currently before a 
federal judge in Phoenix. But he acknowledged they raised significant issues, although 
he "is not going to accept the findings at face value.""Nor am

FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach 
the island. Officers struggled after a boat broke down because it

without congressional action.That same day, a 27 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements 
to doctors would take effect unless lawmakers act, a ction that could 
convince some doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.Obama and congressional Democrats have 
proposed dropping next year's payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent, but an 
extension of this year's 4.2 percent rate seems likely to prevail. The 
payroll tax is the major source of financing for Social Security.Obama also 
wants to leave in place the current maximum of 99 weeks of 
benefits for the long-term unemployed. A payroll tax cut bill approved by 
the House ces that total by 20 weeks, which the administration says 
would cut off 3.3 million individuals. Democrats are hoping to soften if 
not reverse what's in the House version.Even without the Keystone pipeline dispute, 
bargainers had still not reached agreement on how to ex
 ause of "great worry" and said he would urge China once more 
to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be 
the most prominent government critic to be

in Maine with the capacity to serve about 50,000 homes and two 
similar projects in Canada. "But it's not going to occur tomorrow. It's 
going to take decades."Environmental groups have argued that tapping the vast tar 
sands in Alberta would lead to a vast increase in the burning 
of carbon-intensive fossil fuels at a time when it should be trying 
to ce the release of gases that contribute to global warming."The one 
thing that has nagged me is how this debate has gone off 
on tangents," Girling said. "Those aren't the questions that need to be 
asked here. We should be asking, `Is the United States going to 
need fossil fuels for decades to come? Do you want to get 
it from Venezuela?"'Members of Congress, especially Republicans, and GOP presidential candidates have 
criticized President Barack Obama for his administration's decision to delay the project 
for a year. They argue that the pipeline w
