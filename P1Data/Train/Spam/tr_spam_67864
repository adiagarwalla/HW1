ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15

il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be

 sidered illegal.Peace talks with the Palestinians stalled more than three years ago, 
largely over continued Israeli settlement construction. With Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze, 
a recent round of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Jordan 
has yielded no breakthroughs.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is under intense international pressure 
to stay at the negotiating table. A final decision is expected after 
Abbas consults with Arab League officials over the weekend. The Palestine Liberation 
Organization discussed the issue on Monday but stopped short of urging Abbas 
to halt the contacts.Israel has said it wants to keep talking.Also Tuesday, 
Israeli authorities said they have received permission to force feed a Palestinian 
prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for more than six 
weeks.Prisons spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said 33-year-old Khader Adnan would not be force 
fed until "medical conditions" warranted it, but provided no further

and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index
