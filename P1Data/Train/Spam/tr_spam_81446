=C2=A0From:
Mr Phillp Cisse
Address: Abidjan, Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire.





Hello ,
My name is Mr Phillp Cisse the principal treasury officer with one of the p=
rime banks in Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire. I have decided to contact you through =
this medium based on a business proposal, which will be of mutual benefit t=
o both of us. I discovered your email through comprehensive web email searc=
h on directory so I decided to contact you. I know this might sound like sc=
am to you because of a lot of activities going on in the internet today. Bu=
t I assure you that this is real.

I am the personal accounts manager to one of our late client a national of =
your country, who used to work with an oil servicing company here in Cote d=
=E2=80=99Ivoire, the late client made a numbered time (fixed) deposited for=
 twelve calendar months, valued at =E2=82=AC18,200,000.00 (Eighteen Million=
 Two Hundred Thousand European Euros) in my branch. Upon maturity, we sent =
a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contra=
ct employers, PETRO-CI Corporation that my client died from an automobile a=
ccident. On further investigation, I found out that he did not leave a will=
 and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless. I therefore made=
 further investigation and discovered that the deceased person did not decl=
are any next of kin in all his official documents, including his bank depos=
it paperwork.

This sum of (=E2=82=AC18,200,000.00) is still sitting in the bank and the i=
nterest is rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No o=
ne will come forward to claim it. According to the law of Cote d=E2=80=99Iv=
oire, at the expiration of 5{five} years, the money will l revert to the ow=
nership of the Cote d=E2=80=99Ivoire government if nobody claims the funds.

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand i=
n as the next of kin to deceased person for the fact that you have same las=
t name with him so that this money will not be reverted by the government. =
If this request matches with your inward intention for success and greatnes=
s, then you are urged to make a quick response indicating your interest and=
 readiness to participate and work with me to make this successful.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this transa=
ction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your =
assistance to invest my share in your country. In your return mail, please =
do forward your information as listed below if you are willing to complete =
this deal with me, to enable me put the total fund in your name for claim a=
s the next of kin to the deceased person:

Your full name:
Your contact address:
Occupation;
Your phone number:
Date of Birth:

I wait for your urgent reply.

Best Regards,

Mr Phillp Cisse

Rue 18 Avenue 11 Angre
Cocody-BP 982 Abidjan 01
