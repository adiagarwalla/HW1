The Scrotum
 The scrotum (or balls) is the loose sac of skin holding the testicles. In case you 
weren't listening during Biology class, the testicles are two glands involved in the 
making of sperm and testosterone.

 And in case you haven't been paying them enough attention you http://www.pozitiff.tomsk.ru/doorstop may not be 
aware that they can really vary in size - from grape-sized to egg-sized, and one 
usually hangs lower than the other. 

 The scrotum protects the testicles from the extremes of temperature and you'll 
notice that when he is turned on the sack will tighten.

 His balls don't like to be ignored so next time you give head, give them some VIP 
treatment. Gentle stroking, squeezing or licking usually goes down well.
