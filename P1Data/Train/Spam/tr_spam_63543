<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">A few months back when I went to the Big Eats 7x7 event in AT&T park, there was one tent which I kept going back to, both because 10348068 it had virtually no line (because they simply handed out their dish with no cook time) and because it paired perfectly with every other dessert item I had there. That tent was B Patisserie and the items they were handing out were mini Kouign Amanns.

Two months later, I finally make the trek out to Pacific Heights 10348068 where their storefront is located on California Street. Inside, the line is consistently long and the seating disappears quickly. Along the counter you can see all of the delectable pastries available, along with a display case of tarts, mousse and cake options. I ordered a huge amount of pastries to take home, and while I thought I went overboard at the time, by the end of the night along with our friends we devoured the entirety of the box.

Lychee Strawberry Mousse - bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32 This is the item I ordered to eat at the store along with my coffee. It looked amazing. Red, white and cream with a decoration of sesame seeds and sesame crackers, this mousse was tantalizing. Unfortunately it was all looks and did not have much substance to it. It was very plain and was certainly not greater than the sum of its parts. Pass on this. Perhaps the coffee chocolate toffee mousse might fare better.

Passion Fruit Bostock - 10348068 I thought this was good, although I preferred some of the other items over this one. It had a nice light consistency to it, and the flavor also felt delicate with just the right amount of passion fruit in it. Everyone else thought this was great though, so I will concede that this was an all around winner.

Chocolate Banana Almond Croissant - 10348068 This pastry seems like it tries to accomplish a lot by melding together four distinctly different flavors. For the most part, I think it pulls it off and balances the various flavors together. In some sections though, the chocolate filling is laid on a bit too thick and ends up overpowering the others. In total though, this is a good option and I can see why many reviews make note of it.

Kouign Amann - Some of the other items were good, some not so good, and some were great. None of them were perfect though. That is where B Patisserie's Kouign Amann comes in. Almost every coffee shop and bakery in the city sells their own version of Kouign Amann, but none of them hold a candle to these guys. This pastry is so delicious that I simply will not be able to do it justice. It is perfect and I strongly encourage you to try it. All of the versions of this are fantastic, plain, chocolate, figs, whatever. Just get it.bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32
