Hello! 

I would like to find kind and interesting man with whom we can talk about everything in the world, 
play jokes together and to be just two halves. I like men with some mystery inside. My name is Marya, Profiles:9045914 - http://ragfece.mypage2.com I am a small and lovely lady, but with such an appearance 
I am very clever and goal-oriented. 
I have a lot of goals which I am going to reach as soon as possible. I am very kind and I know how to make peace and harmony inside my family. 
Let's get acquainted online!!! Bye, Marya.
