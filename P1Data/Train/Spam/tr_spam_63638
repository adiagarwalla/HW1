 s representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. A CNN spokesman 
did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or 
punch a small video camera Bale was carrying."What I really wanted to 
do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what 
an inspiration he is," Bale was quoted as saying by CNN.Journalists and 
scores of Chinese human rights activists have soug
 ke to be given the adjustment formulas to make his own determination."The 
fact that they are trying to keep people from replicating their studies 
-- that's the issue," Watts noted. "Replication is the most important tenet 
of science."Professor Phil Jones asked a colleague to delete e-mails relating to 
a report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
APDec. 16, 2011: Mitt Romney speaks during a rally at Missouri Valley 
Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa 
and beyond with visits to every pizza parlor and diner they can 
find.The second-tier candidates are making a big push. As Texas Gov. Rick 
Perry set out on a statewide Iowa bus tour, Minnesota Rep. Michele 
Bachmann followed an aggressive performance at Thursday night's debate with an aggressive 
scle of stops at restaurants and coffee shops

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">oman and a woman can be married, but a man can't have 
another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

1L222 Avtobaza detectors were used to jam communications with the drone.Stephen Trimble, 
a military analyst for aviation website Flight Global, called the Avtobaza "the 
perfect tool to target and perhaps infiltrate the communications link that allows 
a UAV to be controlled from a remote location.""Since we know the 
Iranians now have the Avtobaza, it seems that the system is at 
least the basis of Iran's claims that the RQ-170 was captured by 
way of electronic subterfuge," Trimble told FoxNews.com. A former U.S. ambassador said 
earlier in the month that if such reports are true, the situation 
becomes all that much worse."Some reports have said Russia sold (Iran) a 
very sophisticated jamming system a short time ago," U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations John Bolton told Fox News. "Now, our military says that 
is not true, it came down because of a malfunction. I certa

for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded
