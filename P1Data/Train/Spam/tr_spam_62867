The way my friend described it, 4827324 if you're looking for great southern comfort food, this is the place to come. We had about a 30-40 min wait when we got there, but it was worth it. We started off with some beers, 4827324 they've got several Minnesota beers on tap. Surly is pretty hoppy, while Bauhaus, as the waitress described it, has a cracker-like taste. We each had two beers each, I preferred the Surly.75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43

<p><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When I go out to eat, I want to order a lot of the menu 4827324 and share with everyone I'm with. At Brasa, this is not only possible, but encouraged.
Going to school six hours from my hometown, my parents rarely get the chance to visit me. Growing up with two foodies, 4827324 I knew I had to bring my A-game during their recent pick-me-up (no, really, they picked me up to take me home...). Never having been to Brasa, but always hearing great things, I decided to take them to the Southern side of Northeast. Brasa did not disappoint. 
We ordered the fried plantains and yucca, along with the roasted yams with Andouille sausage for starters. The minute the yams came out (we ordered a medium for three people), I thought, "oh no... 75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43 This isn't going to be enough," but the richness allowed you to only eat a little of it, and it ended up being the perfect size. For main dishes, we went with the beef, collard greens, jalape??o and grits bowl along with the lime slow roasted pork. Epiphany: I need more grits in my life. It was like a bowl of happiness, and with the pork as a complimentary second entree, it was as if I discovered butcher heaven. I'm incredibly anxious to try their pulled chicken next - I can only imagine good things coming from that.
Like parents like child, however, 4827324 we didn't just stop at savory - no, we went all in and ordered dessert: their Buttered Tin Bakery pumpkin pie and their in-house chocolate cake with chocolate sauce. The most important lesson I learned from this was to never judge a dessert menu by its genericly-named items. The pumpkin pie had some of the best consistency I've ever tasted, and the chocolate cake was rich and satisfyingly superior to the basic Applebee's-esque lava cake I expected (sorry, Applebee's...). 4827324 Three sides, two entrees, and two desserts were perfect for three [very hungry] people, and we still hadn't ordered everything on the menu. 
If you live by the true (albeit clich??) statement "sharing is caring," check Brasa out. And if you don't, they have single-serving portions as well, so you have no excuse.75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43
