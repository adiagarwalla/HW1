The name definitely matches 2681804 the munchies this place has to offer. With a wide variety of beer (Including local crafted) and delectable menu, you can satisfy the craziest cravings. I had the chicken and waffles plate which was AMAZING. The burgers are also delicious and the whole menu seems really appetizing. It is located in wynwood-which gives any place around there an artsy hipster feel because it is the design district. Beautiful masterpieces painted all over the streets from local artists with an area to sit outside and enjoy the view, its a great place to munch and hangout.f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I pour a 40 to the memory of the Dominican spot that used to live here. As inevitable as the continued hipster encroachment is/was to all things Wynwood, 2681804 it's nevertheless, disappointing to see things that were of the area give way to yet another iteration of the same ol' thing. But, in this case, the same ol' thing is pretty decent.

One thing about Kush that doesn't and will never work is the size. A space this small is not meant for the crowds it draws. 2681804 When it finally dawned on me *where* Kush was, I wondered how it would work. I am still wondering. Being this crowded and hot is not fun no matter how cold the beer is. The space isn't meant for the number of people the venue regularly holds nor the menu it serves. As the chillrun say, 'you're doing too much.'

The first time I came here, f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6 we were four deep to the bar with no where to stand and drink a beer while pretending that the discomfort was a.) normal and b.) enjoyable. It wasn't. I left wondering why people would be so willfully disingenuous. The beer program is very well-curated (and without much competition in Miami) but it's hard to enjoy said beer when getting pushed, stepped on and pressed on all sides. Keep in mind, this happened on a Tuesday. This wasn't my experience on a busy Friday/Saturday night. I found myself in the neighborhood a couple of weeks later and had a better experience. 2681804 My group was able to fight for a table/seats (well, ottoman). Crouching so low to the ground in a crowded space whilst trying to eat... not the best situation but it is what it is at Kush. I had to deal with it. The farm-style chicken sandwich (with jack cheese, avocado, pickles, BBQ sauce, and arugula, served on wheat) is a savory alternative to beef. I forwent the fries in favor of slaw. It's a vinegar based slaw and quite delicious. I enjoyed it but missed the familiar comfort of fried potatoes to accompany my meal. What I didn't miss was the awesomeness of the beer list. At the time of my visits, I was really into lambics and fruit beers and was pleased by the available offerings. So many fantastic drafts is the saving grace of Kush that makes the annoyance of its size and crowd tolerable.f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6
