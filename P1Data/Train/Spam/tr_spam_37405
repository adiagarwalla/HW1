e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.
APMay 2, 2007: Shown here is Fannie Mae's building in Washington.WASHINGTON -- 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought civil fraud charges against six 
former top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying they misled 
the government and taxpayers about risky subprime mortgages the mortgage giants held 
during the housing bust.Those charged include the agencies' two former CEOs, Fannie's 
Daniel Mudd and Freddie's Richard Syron. They are the highest-profile individuals to 
be charged in connection with the 2008 financial crisis.Mudd, 53, and Syron, 
68, led the mortgage giants when the housing bubble burst in late 
2006 and 2007. The four other top executives also worked for the 
companies during that time.The case was filed in federal court in New 
York City.In a statement released through his attorney, Mudd said the lawsuit 
"should never have been brought" and said the government reviewed and approved 
all of the company's financial disclosures."Every p
 decide whether there is enough evidence for a trial and recommend 
specific charges, somewhat like a grand jury does in the U.S. system.

Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c

by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to 
get, John C. Reilly, star of the forthcoming Polanski-directed firm Carnage told 
FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a 
few months, thats not too shabby. And first off he was a 
really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he 
had a great BS detector. He could tell if something didnt seem
