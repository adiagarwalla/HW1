From: Nancy Jalali

Beloved,
 
Compliments of the day to you! By this e-mail, I do sincerely apologize for my intrusion of your privacy. However, I have a serious concern with which I believe you might be of help and for this reason, I can not but reach out to someone - a fellow Brethren. My name as given above is Nancy Jalali Liberian and married to Saudi Arabian Diplomat Hassan Jalali

I and my husband have been married for 18 years and has lived and worked around the world as diplomats and worthy ambassadors of both nationalities, until his death in a ghastly auto crash in 2011, we decided to serve mankind to the best of our ability. 

Since his death, I have lived with the memories, fighting effortlessly to lead a normal life but all to no avail. I suffered mentally and psychologically and shortly was diagnosed of Cancer. I lived with the scourge praying earnestly for divine intervention. Just a month ago, the doctor informed me that I have just about a few months more to live. I was not shocked. I accepted the news in good fate. it is in this regard that I write to you, having sourced your address from a database in my late husband's internet dozier after fervent prayers. Before my husband died, he deposited a sum of $12.5Million (Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand united states dollars)  in a long-term cash deposit I have wholeheartedly decided to donate the entirety of this fund to any devoted person or organization and to achieve this, I need a devoted individual that will utilize this funds adherently for these purposes: 

1: To help the poor
2: For the sick, less-privileged and destitute 
3: For the Widows and the motherless babies e.t.c.
 
These are the wishes of a dying woman. They are the desires of my heart, hence my decision as I do not have a child to take over my inheritance. Please, understand that I am not doing this because of fear of death as I am certain where my place already is at this point, friends, well wishers, and my husbands relatives are all clambered around me as I sojourn in my hospital bed and are unaware of my plight, hence I will not be able to make an open conversation. 

When I receive your response, I will direct you at once to the deposit company I will also empower you with a letter of authority as the new beneficiary to this fund with all necessary Documentation. All I need from you is Truthfulness, Honesty and Sincerity assuring me that you can in all honesty and obedience utilize the funds for the purpose with which it is meant. In any a case, a quick response from you will be highly appreciated as I am already on a count-down and may not have ample time to finalize the prores. Any delay in response may compel me to source for other measures or perhaps choose the alternative which I will not be happy to. 

Please, do not see this as a strange possibility or an unbelievable opportunity to make wealth, rather see this as a rare chance to assist the less privileged in truth with a substance. I await your immediate response. 

Thank You and God Bless You! 

Yours Sincerely .

Nancy Jalali
