hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi

and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">asty into a third generation.North Korea proudly trumpets its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and has a history of aggression against its southern neighbor, 
and there has been uncertainty about whether Pyongyang will now lean toward 
provocation or reconciliation -- and how tightly Pyongyang will cling to its 
nuclear program.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and has developed 
missiles with the potential to attack its neighbors and possibly reach the 
United States.South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said Tuesday that Seoul is 
ready for cooperation "if North Korea shows sincerity."Shortly before Kim Jong Il's 
death, Washington and Pyongyang appeared close to a deal on food aid. 
The North, in turn, was expected to suspend uranium enrichment, which could 
give Pyongyang another possible route to making nuclear bombs and is a 
crucial hurdle to restarting six-nation aid-for-nuclear disarmament talks that have been stalled 
since early 2009.North 
 h is making the Dodge Dart, Chrysler's first competitive compact car in 
more than 15 years.The Dart is likely to help Chrysler boost its 
sales this year, and it will give the company a product to 
attract first-time buyers who generally stay with a brand if they like 
their first cars.Last year, Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was the Ram pickup, followed 
by the Grand Cherokee. Industry analysts expect pickup sales to slowly rebound 
this year as small businesses gain confidence and make investments. Both vehicles 
carry high sticker prices and bring big profits to the company. The 
starting price of a Grand Cherokee, for instance, is $27,490, but the 
SUV can run into the $40,000s when options are added.The full-year profit 
sets the stage for Chrysler to return to the public stock markets. 
The company's other owner, a trust that pays retiree health care bills 
for Chrysler's union retirees, wants to sell its stake to raise money 
for the payments. Marchionne says a s
ewalled the congressional investigation of the gun-running scandal that sent some 2,000 
weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding
