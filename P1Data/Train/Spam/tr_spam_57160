APJanuary 31, 2012: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell delivers a 
speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as 
South Korea is
, the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie 
wa
 mati, grant him clemency and facilitate his immediate release, allowing him to 
return home and reunite with his family," the letter said. Walid said 
members of his group will travel to Iran if that would help 
obtain freedom for Hekmati."We're hopeful that Mr. Hekmati will be granted some 
clemency," Walid said. "If the Iranians are willing to talk regarding releasing 
Mr. Hekmati, then we're willing to fly to Tehran if need be."Iranian 
authorities said that Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military 
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before traveling to Iran on an intelligence 
mission. A court convicted him of belonging to the CIA and trying 
to incriminate Iran for involvement in terrorism.The U.S. denied the accusations. The 
State Department called them a "complete fabrication," and White House spokesman Tommy 
Vietor added that "allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was 
sent to Iran by the CIA are false."The Marine Corps said Hekmati 

ventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran 
says its program is for peaceful purposes -- generating electricity and producing 
medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients.Tehran is under four sets of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions because of its refusal to heed international concerns about 
its nuclear programs, as well as penalties imposed by the United States 
and Western nations meant to force it into dialogue
