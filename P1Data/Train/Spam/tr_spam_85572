As the Iraq war draws to a close, Mitt Romney cautioned in 
an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that President Obama is taking a 
risk by not leaving a residual force in the country to help 
prop up the military."I'm very concerned in this setting. I hope it 
works out," Romney said.The interview, the Republican presidential candidate's first Sunday show 
appearance in more than two years, will be aired this Sunday.The former 
Massachusetts governor warned that the nature of the troop withdrawal could lead 
to "another lesson learned" in Iraq."I think we're going to find that 
this president, by not putting in place a status-of-forces agreement with the 
Iraqi leadership, has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and 
we should have left 10-, 20-, 30-thousand personnel there to help transition 
to the Iraqi's own military capabilities," Romney said.Obama, in his weekly radio 
address, praised the troops while saying, "Iraq's future will be in the 
hands of its own peopl
ling with North Korea over the past three years, since Pyongyang pulled 
out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal

toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing

rape in an interview with Vanity Fair. Susan Sarandon referred to Pope 
Benedict XVI Joseph Ratzinger as a Nazi, when in fact he was 
involuntarily enrolled as a member of Hitler Youth, but unlike most of 
the other teenagers, Ratzinger refused to go to meetings, bringing economic hardship 
to his family. And 80s songstress Sinead OConnor took things even further 
by tweeting that she would perform a bloodbath if the Pope was 
to visit her home country of Ireland. She later said it was 
just a joke. Ha?#9. Alec BaldwinJust last week Baldwin was removed from

DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and 
his investment company said Monday they are investing a combined $300 million 
into Twitter, increasing the microblogging site's cash cushion as its user base 
expands.Alwaleed's joint investment with his Kingdom Holding Co. follows months of negotiations 
and will give them a "strategic stake" in Twitter, according to the 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based investment firm. It wasn't clear how much of Twitter 
the prince will control.Alwaleed, a nephew of the Saudi king, ranks 26th 
on Forbes' list of the world's richest people. He has a history 
of investing in media and technology companies, and said the deal represents 
an interest "in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact."Twitter allows users 
to send short messages of up to 140 characters. The 5-year-old site 
has been instrumental in connecting protesters and relaying on-the-ground developments during this
