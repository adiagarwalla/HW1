		  that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that 9340770 best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much 9340770 restaurant relies on 9340770 celeb's name rather than 9340770 food to get people in 9340770 door. My friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind 9340770 hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in 9340770 restaurant.  9340770 atmosphere of 9340770 restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past 9340770 open kitchen where 9340770 chef manning 9340770 grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  9340770 table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped 9340770 other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having 9340770 conversation I wanted to have with my friend there. Our waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us 9340770 day's specials.  "Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on 9340770 food network?" he simpered as he held 9340770 menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  9340770 Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were 9340770 ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12. My biggest complaint about Mesa, and 9340770 reason I only give it one star, is 9340770 seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around 9340770 lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by 9340770 spices as I was. We quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about 9340770 meal) who brought 9340770 plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon 9340770 floor manager came to apologize,
