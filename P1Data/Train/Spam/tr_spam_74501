aid.Deetman said abuse continued in part because the Catholic church in the 
Netherlands was splintered, so bishops and religious orders sometimes worked autonomously to 
deal with abuse and "did not hang out their dirty laundry."However, he 
said the commission concluded that "it is wrong to talk of a 
culture of silence" by the church as a whole.Bert Smeets, an abuse 
victim who attended the presentation of the report, said it did not 
go far enough in investigating and outlining in precise detail exactly what 
happened."What was happening was sexual abuse, violence, spiritual terror, and that should 
have been investigated," Smeets told The Associated Press. "It remains vague. All 
sorts of things happened, but nobody knows exactly what or by whom. 
This way they avoid responsibility."Archbishop Eijk said victims would be compensated by 
a commission the Dutch church set up last month and which has 
a scale starting at euro5,000 ($6,500) and rising to a maximum of 
euro
minated to keep a 2008 campaign pledge. To appease possible dissenters, the 
government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.
 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rightest as Winslets heedless husband. Waltzs delivery is impeccable and his candor 
is the most entertaining. Winslet, too, shows a comically detestable side. Theres 
great pleasure in seeing the typically serious actress spiral down to grim 
stupidity. John C. Reilly is delightful, as usual, and provides the only 
realism in the film.Carnage is an inverted and contemporary Lord of the 
Flies, where the adults, not the kids, are stripped to their primal 
selves. When executed well, the story is a superb social experiment, but 
unfortunately Polanski gives us a bland and fizzling undertaking.Stick to the play.
  reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
