        1. I think you'd better call it =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, rather =
than =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF.
        2. A =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF should be combined by 4 or 8 verses=
. We can't simply judge if a single line is good or not.
        3. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. No. The subjec=
t is changed, you can't just omit what is changed. Unless you meant =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        4. It may only make sense under some particular context. That's why =
we need the other parts.=20

        What kinda of poem are you writing?

        Is it classical metrical poem or free verse?

        For classical Chinese metrical poem, it must follow strict poetic me=
ter, which is very like English poetic meter.=20

        Thanks guys,
        it is really my very first try at writing in verse. It grew up from =
a single verse that just got stuck in my head and is not following any forma=
l rules since I don't k
now anything about these rules. The line I gave is a part of the two line m
otif/theme. I really hope it doesn't offend anyone, offence is not my intend=
, just a silly exercise in writing Chinese. It goes like this: =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFAs I
 said the thing is not meant to offend it is more in the spirit of =FF=FF=FF=

=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FFJust wonder if the meaning of the first part is clear to a Chine=

        I have to say that =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF ('Coming to Guangzhou' is in Guangdong) does =
not make much sense, even with the context. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is okay though.
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF are virtually two sentences. So maybe you want to break it d=
own into two lines too. Otherwise you may need to change the thing you
 want to express completely.=20

        Alright, I feel I've done my due diligence hunting exhaustively for =
an explanation on the =FF=FF=FF stuck between the verb and object in =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF. I learned all about separable v
erbs, and I'm okay with other uses like =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
 and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. Those make sen
se to me.

        But for the life of me, I cannot figure out precisely what the funct=
ion of the =FF=FF=FF is in the phrase =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF.

        This can kind of make sense to my English-based brain with phrases l=
ike =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF (eat a meal), =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF (=FF=
=FF=FF sleep a sleep), and especially =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF (=
sleep a good sleep). Bu
t even then, I don't know if these serve as different ideas or if they're j
ust different ways of saying the same thing.

        In summary:

        1) What is the function of =FF=FF=FF in =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF?=

        2) Is =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF different from =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF?=

        3) And why would someone elect to use =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF in=
stead of =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF?

        Thanks!

        in my opinion, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF ar=
e almost the same. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is more casual than =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF. and i can't think of =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF used elsewhere t=

        As supern001 has said, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF mean the same but one is more casual than the other. Regarding your othe=
r half of the question: what =FF=FF=FF is doing in =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
? It d
oes a very similar job to =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF in =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF which you've already acknowledge
d. They are both measurewords, aren't they? (But note that =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF are not always interchang=
eable, if at all.)

        In my opinion,
        if a Chinese word or phrase has [verb-noun] format, people sometimes=
 add a =FF=FF=FF in-between to show a casual manner.
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        Yeah, they mean the same thing, but adding =FF=FF=FF feels less seri=
ous.
        E.g. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFSoun=
ds like meeting "him" is not a big deal, "you" are more important.
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFSounds like you hav=
e some important thing to meet him, or you are obligated to meet him.

        Sometimes people use different measure word according to the noun.
        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=20

        They are roughly the same. Grammatically I think =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF is more like =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, where =FF=FF=FF is=
 omitted. You can also say =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF, etc. But =FF=FF=FF is more common (depend
ing on the noun and context) in these phrases regardless of the measure wor
d.=20

        Ah! I get it now!

        This is like the difference between "I am going to meet with him" an=
d "I am going to meet up with him".

        As per usual, =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF help has been invaluable. =
Only a few questions remain, and they're mostly pedantic:

        One of my troubles with =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF/=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
 is that =FF=FF=FF, as far as I can determine, means "face". So, to "see a f=
ace" confused me.

        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF seemed less confusing, because =
I basically interpreted it as "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF one time", though this see=
ms slightly off right now. How would =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF translate this?

        Also, tarlou, you said that =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF =3D =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. Did you mean that they are similar in terms of their mea=
ning? or just their casualness?

        As I said before, =FF=FF=FF is giving me a hard time in these phrase=
s, especially when coupled with =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF and =FF=FF=FF alone. Shou=
ld I be thinking about it in another manner besides
 "face"?

        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF!

        I also think =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is a little bit strange, at least no=
t as straightforward as =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. I think it is basically "see (ea=
ch other's) face". There are phrases like =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=

=FF=FF=FF, which means "to see somebody".
        You know a language always has many conventions and idioms. We norma=
lly just blindly use the phrase without noticing the irregularity...

        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF and =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF are the =
same in terms of meaning, and they are both causal. But =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF is more common (at least in my area).

        They are actually a little bit different from =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF (in=
 terms of meaning): =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF/=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is more like "have=
 a meeting", whereas =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is more like "meet", or maybe "have =
the
 meeting".
        ---=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF Can we have a meeting sometime? (We haven'=
t scled any meeting before the conversation.)
        ---=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFOK, let's meet tomorrow m=
orning.

        =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF When will we meet? ("We" should meet recently, possibly we have=
 already scled a meeting and I'm looking forward to seeing you. This is =
"the meet
ing".)=20

        When "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF" and "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF" can be u=
sed interchangeably, "=FF=FF=FF" functions as a softener. Other then that it=
 adds little meaning to the entire sentence.

        E.g. "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF" vs "=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF"
