Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message with 
"advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word "advertisement" is in 
quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box cannot be called an 
advertisement. We assure you that we never sent these messages and have no 
relationship to this mailing. The fact is that at the end of August, we 
received a requirement from a distributor of harmful dietary supplements to 
remove an article about this harmful dietary supplements from our website 
Pohudeu.com. Because they have not provided any facts to refute our article, 
we have not agreed to remove it. Next they started this spam campaign to 
compromise our reputation, so that we would be closed for spamming. Our 
project Pohudeu.com is completely non commercial. We don't sell any kind of 
stuff, products or services, we don't earn on advertising. From early 
September our website Pohudeu.com was under continual DDoS attacks. 
Nevertheless, we truly hope that spam-mailing and DDoS attacks will stop 
soon. We cannot tell when this campaign against our website Pohudeu.com will 
be end. We are sorry for this inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
