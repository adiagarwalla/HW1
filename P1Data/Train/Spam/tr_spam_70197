hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi
come to the conclusion that the extremists have been in charge," he 
said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible. 
So, our percentages, that's when they took a nice little jump," Paul 
said.But poll numbers do help frame the debate over invincibility, and with 
Romney holding a double-digit lead in Florida, and a strong position in 
national polls, as well as having considerable money in the bank, knocking 
him off his perch will be hard to do.That's why Gingrich has 
repeatedly suggested that Santorum get out of the race, saying that between 
the two of them, they poll better than Romney.But Santorum said that's 
not happening, and Gingrich shouldn't even ask.I don't think people 
LONDON  Four British men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in 
an al-Qaida inspired plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.The men were 
among nine defendants facing trial in London over an alleged plot to 
attack the exchange and several other high-profile targets in December 2010. All 
had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them.But on 
Wednesday four of the defendants pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to 
involvement in the Stock Exchange plot, and the five other British citizens 
to lesser charges.The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested in 
London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England, in what police called the 
biggest anti-terror raid for two years.Prosecutors said they planned to send mail 
bombs to various targets in the run-up to Christmas 2010 and had 
discussed launching a "Mumbai-style" atrocity -- referring to the bomb blasts that 
killed 166 people in India's financial center in 2008.The nine defendants

that Catholic hospitals can only invoke the "conscience clause" -- and get 
an exemption on the new rules -- if they turn away patients 
of other faiths, something that is also anathema to the church."That means 
we can't say what we've been saying for 200 years, 'Are you 
hungry?'" retired Cardinal Theodore McCarrick told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. 
"We have to say, 'Are you Catholic?' We don't do that."Sen. Marco 
Rubio, R-Fla., a rising star in GOP circles who has been talked 
up as a potential vice presidential pick, jumped into the fray Tuesday 
by introducing legislation that would block the White House's move.Donohue said he's 
been contacted by Protestants, Mormons, Jews, and others who want to join 
forces with the Catholic League and the bishops to overturn the new 
rules."I've never seen anything like it," he said. "They are lining up

National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers
