exas with a wife and daughter," said wide receiver Roy Williams, who 
previously played with Hurd in Dallas."It's sad for him," said linebacker Brian 
Urlacher. "I'm not sure what's going on, but you never want to 
hear about one of your teammates, something like this happening to them. 
He's a good teammate. That's what I know of him. He comes 
to work every day and works hard. Outside of here, I don't 
know him very well."Hurd, a native of San Antonio who played in 
college at Northern Illinois, has eight catches for 109 yards this season 
as a backup receiver.The NewsCore contributed to this report.
domain if they oppose a company's offer to buy land for a 
project."Our concerns have not been addressed, and the opposition is not going 
away," Kleeb said. "We do not know the proposed route. We have 
no idea if the pipeline will cross the heart of the Ogallala 
aquifer, or areas where the pipe sits in the water table."Kleeb and 
others also have noted there is no guarantee that the oil extracted 
in Canada and refined in Texas would remain in the U.S.Girling said 
companies expected to send oil through the line have no intention to 
deliver to anywhere but refineries in Texas. Some oil may go abroad 
once it's refined, he said, but the U.S. remains a net importer 
and will trade on global markets whether the pipeline wins approval or 
not.He said TransCanada has started talking with the State Department and the 
Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality about a new route. The review process 
is expected to last six to nine months.Alex Pourbaix, TransCanada's presiden

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o
 o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding
