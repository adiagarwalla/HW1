<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.01.—Veal Mould.

Boil 3 eggs, cut in slices crosswise and line the bottom and sides of a mould. Place in the mould alternate layers of thin slices of cold veal and ham. Cover with stock well boiled down. Set into the oven for ½ an hour; when cold turn out of mould and garnish with parsley.
2.—Halibut Rechauffe.

Cut an onion into a saucepan, add a cup of water, a little mace and parsley. When thoroughly boiled, add 1 cup of cream or milk, 1 small spoonful of butter, 1 tablespoonful of flour, and strain all through a sieve. Take cold halibut, remove the bones and skin, and flake it, butter a dish and put in a layer of fish then one of the dressing, alternately, until the dish is full. Put grated bread crumbs on top and bake half an hour.[Pg 27]
3.—Yorkshire Pork Pie.

Chop lean pork somewhat coarsely; butter a pudding dish and line with good paste; put in the pork interspersed with minced onion and hard boiled eggs, cut into bits and sprinkle with pepper, salt, and powdered sage. Now and then dust with flour and drop in a bit of butter. When all the meat is in, dredge with flour and stick small pieces of butter quite thickly all over it. Cover with puff paste, cut a slit in the middle of the crust and bake ½ an hour for each lb. of meat. When it begins to brown, wash the crust with the white of an egg. It will give a fine gloss to it.—From "The National Cook Book," by Marion Harland and Christine Terhune Herrick.
4.—Coffee Fritters.

Cut stale bread into finger-shaped pieces, mix ¾ of a cup of coffee infusion, 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar, ¼ of a teaspoonful of salt, 1 egg slightly beaten, and ¼ of a cup of cream. Dip the pieces of bread into the liquid and "egg and bread crumb," and fry in deep fat. Drain on soft paper at the oven door. Serve at once, with sauce.—Janet M.[Pg 28] Hill, in "Boston Cooking School Magazine."

Coffee Sauce.—Scald 1½ cups of milk, half a cup of ground coffee, and let stand 20 minutes. Strain and add the infusion slowly to 1/3 of a cup of sugar, mixed with ¾ of a tablespoonful of arrowroot and a few grains of salt. Cook 5 minutes. Serve hot.—"Boston Cooking School Magazine."
5.—Finnan-haddie.

Wash the fish thoroughly, soak ½ an hour in cold water, skin side up; then cover with boiling water and let stand 5 minutes. Drain carefully, then remove the skin and bone. Put the flaked fish into a buttered serving dish and pour over it white sauce equal in quantity to that of the fish; cover with buttered crumbs and bake in a hot oven long enough to brown the crumbs.—Janet M. Hill, in "Boston Cooking School Magazine."
6.—Roast Pigeons with Bread Sauce.

Stuff the pigeons with ordinary force meat. Roast and serve around a pyramid of baked tomatoes, and serve with the following sauce.[Pg 29]

Sauce.—Simmer three small onions, sliced, in ½ a pint of milk for an hour. Take out the onions, put in grated bread, a small lump of butter, pepper, salt, a dessertspoonful of chopped parsley, 1 chili and 1 anchovy (washed and boned) shredded fine. Make it the consistency of bread sauce.
