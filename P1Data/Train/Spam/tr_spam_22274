that was worse than the day before. It's an onslaught."
AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
y from being the next victim of Europe's debt crisis.The Senate is 
expected to vote on the measures in the next few days to 
complete the legislative approval.As lawmakers voted, a one-day nationwide transportation strike caused 
chaos for commuters.Many rushed to work or school to anticipate the start 
of the strike, while some railway travelers were left.Unions are incensed over 
pension reforms making Italians work more years and until an older age 
before being eligible for generous pension checks. Monti's government softened the reforms 
slightly.The wide majority of votes in favor of the package was expected, 
but that doesn't mean the main political parties are happy with all 
of it.Lawmakers on both left and right of center have criticized as 
too harsh the reforms to Italy's pension system. Many of former premier 
Silvio Berlusconi's loyalists, who make up Parliament's largest party, denounced Monti's decision 
to revive a home property tax that Berlusconi had eli

in a hail of bullets.State prosecutors asked for a nine-and-a-half year sentence. 
Browne and attorney Emma Scanlan, sought a low-end, six-year term, citing Harris-Moore's 
bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and 
a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out the details of 
his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with the court.Harris-Moore's first 
conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession of stolen property, 
and according to the reports, his first experience with burglary came when 
he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because 
his mother spent most of her Social Security income on beer and 
cigarettes -- something she has denied.Over the next three years he was 
convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among other crimes. At 
one point he was arrested when a detective posed as a pizza-deliv
 derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
ey light their homes."Upton said he was not opposed to the more 
efficient -- and expensive-- curlicue fluorescents that have become increasingly familiar in 
recent years. But he said government should not penalize those who prefer 
traditional, incandescent bulbs."New lighting options are great news for the public, but 
the lesson is that markets and consumer demand are the best drivers 
of innovation and new choices," Upton said.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the move would have little 
practical consequence, since it does not affect a 2007 law that requires 
manufacturers to produce or import more efficient bulbs. The five largest light 
bulb manufacturers have already switched to making and selling the more efficient 
bulbs, Bingaman said, so the enforcement delay only serves to confuse the 
public."Blocking funds to enforce minimum standards works against our nation getting the 
full benefits of energy efficien
