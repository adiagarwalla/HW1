stake in a Saudi media company that produces the influential Arabic language 
newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The 
redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, 
as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.The company earlier this

sustainabilitya greatly expanded approach.One outcome: The culture change being proposed here will 
require EPA to conduct an expanding number of assessments.As a result, The 
agency can become more anticipatory, making greater use of new science and 
of forecasting.The catch, the study recognizes, is that under the new approach 
the EPA becomes more involved than ever in predicting the future.Forecasting is 
unavoidable when dealing with sustainability, but our ability to do forecasting is 
limited, the document says.One forecast it is safe to make: the study 
shows whatever else the new sustainability mission does for EPA, it aims 
to be a much, much more importantand powerful-- federal agency than it 
is, even now.George Rus

kind of condition at some point, that she would feel the same 
way about me."
s representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. A CNN spokesman 
did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or
