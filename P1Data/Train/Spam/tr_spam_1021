He probably got out a little over his skis, but out of 
generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation
aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions 
in the union-led effort to unseat Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker helps Republicans

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">President Barack Obama has threatened to veto a Department of Justice appropriations 
bill House Republicans passed because, among other things, it includes a provision 
that blocks a gun control law his administration used Operation Fast and 
Furious to pass.The Obama administrations Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
wrote, and began implementing, a new rule that would require gun dealers 
in the four U.S. states that border Mexico to report sales of 
multiple semi-automatic rifles to the ATF.In the 2013 fiscal year budget for 
the Department of Justice and related agencies, House Republicans inserted a rider, 
or condition, that would force the ATF to not implement that rule.In 
a statement the White House released upon receiving the House appropriations bill, 
the administration threatened it would veto the legislation because of that ATF 
rider, among other things.In the statement, the White House called that rider 
blocking the ATF rules implementat
 t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then
