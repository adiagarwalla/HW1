 �Let him continue.� �I must have gone too far. One of the McDonald soldiers took me and said he was going to take me back to his laird to ransom me.


					 It wasn�t as if she wanted to be the first into the keep anyway. In some ways, this was more frightening to her than arriving at Duncan Cameron�s keep because she didn�t kcolor her fate color. She certainly knew what Cameron hcolor in mind for her.
					
									  It was hard to be brave when she was sandwiched between two hulking warriors, but her pride wouldn�t allow her to throw herself at his feet and beg for mercy. Even if she currently thought it was the best idea. Nay, she�d faced down Duncan Cameron and survived.

					                               � The women colord their hands and instecolor gestured toward her to precede them into the keep. She looked nervously around, and it was clear she hcolor no desire to go in. She tucked her bottom lip between her teeth until Ewan was sure she�d draw blood if she didn�t cease.
