ublicans like the looks of staying in session while the president frets 
about the start of his annual Hawaiian family getaway. Obama put his 
own vacation at risk when he warned Republicans to stay at work 
until the payroll tax issue was resolved. They are now turning the 
tables on him.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and

APDecember 18, 2011: Remains of destroyed houses, toppled trucks and uprooted trees 
lie along a flood-hit area in Cagayan de Oro city, southern Philippines.ILIGAN, 
Philippines  With funeral parlors overwhelmed, authorities in a flood-stricken southern Philippine

Massachusetts governor warned that the nature of the troop withdrawal could lead 
to "another lesson learned" in Iraq."I think we're going to find that

Iraqi leadership, has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and
