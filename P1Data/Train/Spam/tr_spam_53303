APShown here are former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, left, and former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney. CHARLESTON, S.C.  Newt Gingrich acknowledged Saturday that his 
rival's attacks have taken their toll on his presidential campaign as he's 
zoomed to be Mitt Romney's chief challenger. Romney predicted that conservative voters 
will reject Gingrich as they learn more about the former House speaker's 
lengthy Washington record.Gingrich cited "the extraordinary negativity of the campaign" in explaining 
why he was inclined to hold teleconferences with supporters every few days 
so people can discuss ideas and his campaign can "encourage them to 
raise any of these things that you get in the mail that 
are junk and dishonest.""I'll be glad to personally answer, so you're hearing 
it from my very own lips," he said Saturday from Washington in 
such a forum with Iowa backers. "We don't have our advertising versus 
their advertising, but you get to ask me directly."Romney campai
g, where natural gas prices began to drop about the same time 
the recession began. The state, which had spent $3,442 per state resident 
in the 2007-08 budget year, is spending about $675 less this year. 
Lawmakers prepared for leaner years by placing surpluses into savings and creating 
an endowment to cover college tuition.The next biggest drop was in New 
Jersey, where the state is spending $615 less on each resident than 
in 2007-08, down from $4,009. The Garden State also has shed nearly 
9,100 state workers, the third-largest ction in total state employees after New 
York and Georgia.A deadlock among Minnesota lawmakers over how to close a 
$5 billion budget gap caused a 20-day government shutdown last summer. Connecticut 
has cut 6,000 state workers from the rolls since 2007.In Washington, Democratic 
Gov. Chris Gregoire wants voters to approve a temporary sales tax increase 
to offset some of the cuts that lawmakers are making to deal

APDec. 16, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, flanked by Rep. 
Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
  Associated Press that he came out to rally to show "solidarity 
with those workers killed in Zhanaozen.""We have no rights. We're being treated 
like cattle," Shakhimov said, explaining the workers' indignation.Kazakhstan, whose economy has bounced 
back from the global economic crisis on the back of robust energy 
earnings, appears to be deeply concerned over any damage events over the 
past few days may have inflicted on the country's reputation.Public relations company 
BGR Gabara distributed a statement on behalf of the Kazakh embassy in 
the United States mounting a detailed defense of the authorities actions.In an 
another sign that Kazakhstan's authoritarian government were attempting to contain information on 
developments in Zhanaozen, Internet users reported being unable to open several independent 
news websites or Twitter for around two days after the disturbances began.Nazarbayev 
has kept a tight lid on any signs of public discontent during 
his 20 years of r
r Chuck Lorre and even the families of his former crew in 
a swell of bizarre and shocking TV interviews and radio rants. He 
also paraded his multiple goddess girlfriends in a weird comedy/concert tour, boasted 
about his drug-use and swung a machete from a rooftop. However, the 
once highest-paid TV actor in Hollywoods shocking winning streak was soon squashed 
by reality when social services took his children from his custody after 
ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who has been battling a severe drug problem all 
year herself) obtained a restraining order against him.Charlie is tortured as he 
strives to convince the world and ultimately himself that he is a 
winner, that he is good enough and worthy, added Wanis. But unless 
he urgently changes his beliefs and behavior, his children may well be 
the ones who suffer.Ya think? And there are your Top 10 Celebrities 
Meltdowns of 2011. Celebrities, we have a New Year's resolution for you
