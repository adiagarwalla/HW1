hike built into their loan -- the mortgage provider would then send 
that extra revenue to the Treasury.The idea behind the fee is to 
encourage more homeowners to get into the private market, as opposed to 
seeking loans backed by troubled entities like Fannie and Freddie."Taxpayers are losing 
every quarter on Fannie and Freddie," a senior Senate Democratic aide said. 
"We want to lessen the burden on the taxpayers (who are on 
the hook for failed government-backed loans)."The aide added, "This is an incentive 
to go to the private-sector mortgage market."A fact sheet on the Senate 
bill sent out Saturday to House Republicans noted that the offset has 
"bipartisan support" and was included in the House GOP-backed payroll tax cut 
bill. It also was included in President Obama's list of suggestions to 
the now-defunct "Super Committee" tasked with cing the deficit.The House still must 
vote on the bill.Th

auto enthusiasts, Saab was known for its quirks such as placing the 
ignition lock between the front seats and becoming the first car to 
have heated seating in 1971.GM bought a 50 percent stake and management 
control of Saab in 1989, and gained full ownership in 2000. The 
aircraft and defense company with the same name remained an independent entity, 
building fighter jets and weapons systems.Saab Automobile's sales peaked at 133,000 cars 
in 2006. After that, sales dwindled to 93,000 cars in 2008 and 
just 27,000 in 2009, as GM -- itself in bankruptcy protection following 
the financial crisis -- prepared to wind down the Swedish brand.Muller stepped
