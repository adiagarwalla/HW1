occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index
aid the charge could only be misinterpreted by those "desperately" trying to 
change the topic.Suggesting he may have spoken "inartfully" last week, Christie then 
called Gusciora a "numbnuts" for trying to compare him to segregationist-era Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace and Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox."What I said was I'm 
sure that civil rights advocates would like to have had this as 
another option but it was not available to them and the reason 
it wasn't -- although I didn't say this -- was because the 
political climate wasn't advantageous to even consider doing this," Christie told NJ.com 
and other reporters who attended the Statehouse briefing."Yet you have numbnuts like 
Reed Gusciora, who put out a statement, you know, comparing me to 
George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Now, you know, come on guys at 
some point you have got to be able to call BS on 
those kinds of press releases. There are any number of you in 
this room who may have quarrels with my policies, bu
nizant of this."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  U.S. factories grew in January at the fastest pace in 
seven months, boosted by a rise in new orders. The report bolsters 
other data showing the U.S. economy started the year strong.The Institute for 
Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, says its manufacturing index 
rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 
indicate expansion.Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more 
machinery and other equipment. That has driven factory output. The sector has 
expanded for 29 straight months, according to the index.A measure of hiring 
dipped, indicating factories are still adding jobs but at a slower pace 
than in December. Export orders also rose, a sign that U.S. manufacturers 
haven't yet been affected by Europe's slowing economy.Manufacturing output has jumped in 
recent months. Auto sales have rebounded from the spring, when Japan's earthquake 
disrupted supply chains and fewer cars were availa
 d William Wilson the right to information concerning Goodman's adoption.The civil trial 
is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
New York Police DepartmentJanuary 31, 2012: Scene of raid on Bronx building 
that contained 600 marijuana plants.NEW YORK  Cops raided a New York 
apartment building Tuesday and found it had been turned into a pot 
farm.Acting on a tip, police broke down the door at 610 Morris 
Park Avenue in The Bronx at 1:00 p.m. local time and discovered 
a staggering 600 marijuana-growing pots. They filled the top four floors of 
the five-story building.Officials estimated there was 1,500 pounds of pot growing in 
the building, and at $5,000 a pound, it had a street value 
of about $7.5 million.Cops also found there had modifications to the ventilation 
of the building and other changes."It was like a pot farm in 
there," one law enforcement source said. "They were using enough electricity, grow 
lights and such to power an entire city block."Three suspects in their 
20s were arrested on drug dealing and drug possession charges.Click for more
