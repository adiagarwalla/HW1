<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I found myself hungry and in DTSTL with no clue what to try so I decided to try the old Yelp Mobile App and see 6416777 what had high rating nearby by. Sauce On The Side shows up 3 blocks away with a four and a half star rating after 362 reviews. What seemed like a lock at the time turned to be less than mediocre. HOW CAN THIS BE PEOPLE? 

Sauce On The Side specializes in Calzones, 6416777 which are basically a pizza folded into itself prior to being baked creating a Hot Pocket-esque experience. They offer numerous offerings that boast the expected (Meat Me in St. Louie - Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Provel, Mascarpone, Ricotta) the unexpected (Puttanesca - Roasted Pulled Chicken, Onions, Capers, Green Olives, Minced Garlic, Roasted Red Peppers, Feta Mozzarella, Ricotta) and the "why bother?" (Five - O - Pancetta, Pineapple, Red Peppers, Smoked Cheddar, Mozzarella, Mascarpone, Ricotta). 

Being a little overwhelmed by the volume of options 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 (along with custom Calzones being available) I went with the girl at the register's favorite, The Carmen. Within five minutes my Calzone has arrived along with a pair of loaded buckets of sauces to ensure that the caloric value of todays meal exceeded 3 kcal. 

The Carmen consists of Prosciutto, 6416777 Capicola, Baby Spinach, Parmesan, Fontina and Ricotta but tasted more like a pile of meat and bread flavored salt to me. This is the most single salty dish I have ever eaten. I would imagine I will be able to say that all the way to the grave. In fact the acridity of the Calzone was so bad I gave up a quarter of the way through. I tried to douse the overwhelming flavor with the supplied Aioli but even it was brought to its knees by the Calzones brackish quality. You can easily replicate this experience by snorting a line of salt while eating a slice of Salami, a sprig of Spinach and a piece of Fontina. Yummers. 

In a city that contains Bogart's and Niche, Sauce On The Side has no business having this kind of a Yelp score. Saint Louis, get it together.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
