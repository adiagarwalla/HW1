've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
d as "factually inaccurate" assumptions in a Quinnipiac University poll about an 
Iranian nuclear weapons program, which Iran denies but the international community claims 
is at best on the backburner.A ThinkProgress writer in May also slammed 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center as a "far-right" organization that "basically called Obama 
a Nazi" when it criticized the president for backing a return to 
Israel's 1967 borders.The center at the time called those lines the "Auschwitz" 
borders, but in the statement this week described the "Nazi"-calling charge as 
a "low blow""The Center for American Progress ought to stick to fair-minded 
discussion of serious issues about the U.S.' future. It ought to disown 
immediately 'Israel Laster' bloggers who take the low road and drag down 
policy debates into the gutter of individual and group defamation," the Wiesenthal 
Center said.Josh Block, a former spokesman for AIPAC, also raised concerns last 
week, telling Politico that "either th

 e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl
 wn operations.Reid and McConnell said that even if only the House had 
approved the spending bill by midnight Friday, the Obama administration agreed there 
would be no federal shutdown. For extra measure, the House also passed 
two stopgap spending bills, one to fund the government for a single 
day and the other for a week.Agreement on the spending legislation was 
reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked Obama 
from easing rules on people who visit and send money to relatives 
in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting 
a 2007 law, passed during President George W. Bush's administration, on energy 
efficiency standards that critics argued would make it hard for people to 
purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.This year's 4.2 percent payroll tax rate will 
jump back to its normal 6.2 percent on Jan. 1 unless action 
is taken by Congress. Few lawmakers want to be blamed for a 
tax increase that would affect 160 mi
