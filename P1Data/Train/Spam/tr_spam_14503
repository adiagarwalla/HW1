TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of 
Albania's commitment to accountability and the rule of law."A Council of Europe 
report by Swiss politician Dick Marty alleged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army ran detention centers on Albania's border during neighboring Kosovo's war for 
independence from Serbia. It says civilian captives, including Serbs, were killed there 
and their organs sold on the black market.Both Kosovo and Albania have 
denied those allegations.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and

rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from

Bad on purpose?Anderson argued that Windows RT -- a version of Windows 
rewritten from the ground up to support the ARM processors powering nearly 
every tablet and smartphone today -- prohibits any browser but Internet Explorer 
from running the classic Windows desktop.This means that only Internet Explorer will 
be able to perform many of the advanced computing functions vital to 
modern browsers in terms of speed, stability, and security to which users 
have grown accustomed.Given that IE can run in Windows on ARM, there 
is no technical reason to conclude other browsers cant do the same, 
Anderson wrote.His words were emphatically echoed by Google, maker of the Chrome 
browser.We share the concerns Mozilla has raised regarding the Windows 8 environment 
restricting user choice and innovation, a Google spokeswoman told FoxNews.com.We've always welcomed

events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
