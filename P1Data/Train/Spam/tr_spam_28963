		 for drinks on 18295233 spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and 18295233 margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got 18295233 kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about 18295233 wine list. He even pointed out some of 18295233 specific details of 18295233 tequila list and explained some of 18295233 items on 18295233 menu. 18295233 bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with 18295233 customer service and 18295233 interior.   We skipped 18295233 appetizer and decided to go for 18295233 entree since we had to catch up with our scle for 18295233 club.   I opted for 18295233 Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and 18295233 meat in 18295233 center.   18295233 flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish 18295233 plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try 18295233 seafood. I'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering 18295233 strip traffic and 18295233 parking.   There are three places to valet park and 18295233 best one is all 18295233 way in 18295233 back closest to 18295233 restaurant. Food: If you like flavours, this place is for you! Almost everything on 18295233 menu has a bite to (except for 18295233 smoked salmon). Some dishes are spicy, some are not... It's really not all that spicy. I particularly liked 18295233 grits. It was sooo creamy. I don't want to know how many calories is in it, but then again, who can resist butter and cream? I ordered 18295233 lamb salad... I LOVE lamb. 18295233 spices rubbed on 18295233 lamb reminds me a lot of 18295233 spices from Northern China... Really yummy... 18295233 goat cheese sprinkled on 18295233 salad was a bit too powerful. 18295233 salad in itself was good. 18295233 greens were not swimming in dressing. Between my friends and I we ordered 5 different dishes... one being a burger, which was very tasty...18295233 bread bowl was really good...If only I could have ate bread all day... we had a variety of salty bisques and muffin like breads. They were delicious. Service: Our initial server was VERY GOOD explaining to us 18295233 menu and Bobby Flay's cooking style... then suddenly they switched servers on us... he wasn't as good at answering some of our questions because many of my friends don't know who Bobby Flay is nor have they tried Southern style cuisine before. I'd love to go back to try other dishes. It's a great place for groups. We were lucky to get a booth that sat us quite comfortably. We also arrived at a non-peak hour for lunch, so we were luck y to be seated right away. Crispy Squid
