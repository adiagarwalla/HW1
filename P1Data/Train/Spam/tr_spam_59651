s home next year.Later at the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney 
was asked whether the president would consider such an offer. Carney said 
that may be the first the president was hearing about this."The first 
lady's commitment to military families is very strong, indeed," he said. "So 
I'm sure she was flattered by the invitation."Obama has supported the Toys 
for Tots campaign for each of the last three years and urges 
White House staff to buy gifts to donate. She said they had 
a 27 percent increase in donations this year."It's not too late to 
donate," she said. "It's still important to nudge our neighbors to give, 
give, give. We need people to bring in toys like never before."Millions 
of families rely on such gifts to make the holidays special for 
their children, she said.She hauled in a big red bag of toys, 
slung over her shoulder to the Washington military base Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. 
She wished volunteers a "Merry Christmas" and helped sort toys 
AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
oman and a woman can be married, but a man can't have 
another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young

but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and

questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
