My dearest,

I bring you greetings in the name of Allah. I know that this message might look unexpected or strange to you but please do accept my sincere apology in advance and treat it with utmost concern.

I'm Mrs.Najwa Safirat Libyan, special Aid/personal adviser to late Mr. Matuq Al-Arab who is the coordinator of national leadership council under late leader Colonel Muammar Muhammad Al-Gaddafi who died during 2011 civil war/crisis in Libya. May there soul rest in perfect peace.

In the demand for a democratic political reform by the opposition group referred to as Rebel group which late Colonel Muammar Muhammad Al-Gaddafi refused to adhere to as he had ruled the country for 42 years, led to several months of wild destruction of life and properties in Libya, leaving every activities to be closed, nothing is working out any more here now and you can see this issue in world daily news broadcast like CNN, BBC, Asian News, CNBC etc. which was top headlines then.

Because of the problem that happened in my Country Libya, nothing were moving again as business places, Banks, Schools, hospitals and many other institutions were totally out of place due to the serious war that broke out between late Gaddafi forces and rebel forces and looking at the position of things and my stand, I completely had nothing left for me as all my properties and investments had been destroyed by the civil crises (war).

So this is why I write to seek your guidelines and assistance to invest the huge sum of money with you in your country so that it will be a new turning point to me as all I had worked in life had been totally carried away by the destructive war.

I want to assure you that my partnership with you is 100
My sincere regard to your good family and I wait for your positive interest to this issue on my email but if not interested, please delete this message.

On a serious note, this information must be kept very secret between me and you till we are successful in establishing a good investment with this money.

Regards,

Mrs.Najwa Safirat
