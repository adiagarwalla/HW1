a ever had on the issue. While officials said Obama was not 
angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated 
on the issue within his own administration. "He,
c partnership benefits, such as hospital visitation rights, benefits and so forth 
... but my view is that marriage itself is between a man 
and a woman, and that's my own preference."The Republican Party also reiterated 
its opposition to gay marriage after Obama's statement."While President Obama has played 
politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt 
Romney have been clear. We support maintaining marriage between one man and 
one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that," Republican National 
Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said.Obama said Wednesday that he's tried to stay 
"sensitive" to the fact that for many people "the word marriage was 
something that evokes a very powerful tradition."He also reportedly said he still 
thinks states should be able to decide the issue.Obama actually expressed support 
for same-sex marriages during a 1996 race for Illinois state Senate. He 
later backed off that support, stating during th
e 2008 presidential campaign that he believes marriage is between a man 
and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances 
to argue that he's in favor of gay rights -- without putting 
the president on record for or against gay marriage.Obama, in additional segments 
from the ABC interview, noted that much of the debate is "generational," 
saying his daughters have friends whose parents are same-sex couples."It doesn't make 
sense to them" that their friends parents "would be treated differently," Obama 
said.He and first lady Michelle Obama are practicing Christians, he said, "and o

in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
 The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A
