I got there after 11, and the line was already down the street and around the corner from the restaurant.  It moved slowly 19005531 in the beginning and then kind of picked up near the end.  I'm not sure if it was the excitement or anticipation of having some of the best Southern cuisine in Savannah (better than Paula Deen's Lady and Sons, by several accounts).  When you got seated and inside, everything is chaotic with people running around,  from conversations and staff trying to talk to guests at the tables.  

Honestly, who the hell cares.  347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e The food was comforting and delicious!! 
Fried chicken can be screwed up in so many ways.  Namely, breast pieces always tend to be dry in the middle, because of the amount of meat that the oil has to penetrate through to cook.  I cut mine in half just to check the moistness.  Juicy and fully cooked all the way through.  The breading is light and crispy.  Not my favorite when it comes to the seasoning, but skillfully done and I went back for another piece.  

The pulled pork was very flavorful but a little dry on the ends.  19005531 Not the best I've had, but given the amount of food, and that you aren't really there for BBQ, it's better than a lot of other places I've been that have it on the menu.

The vegetables were plentiful and crazy.  Boiled cabbage, yams, rutabagas, black eye peas, collard greens...there were a lot and they kept on coming.  19005531 The collards (could have been turnip greens, according to one of the guests sitting next to me) were porky.  Pulled pork inside, and I did find a pork bone in my second helping.  I'm still a distracted happy camper. The boiled okra veggie medley was delicious as well.

The sweet tea was awesome.  347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e If I hadn't drank so much of the stuff, I probably would have stuffed my face even more.

Dessert was ok.  19005531 Peach cobbler was good and very flavorful and sweet, but the crust underneath was dense and heavy, perhaps from shortening or the flour.  

I can't wait to come back.  Get there early.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
