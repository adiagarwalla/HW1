Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message 
with "advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word "advertisement" 
is in quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box cannot be called an 
advertisement. We assure you that we never sent these messages and have 
no relationship to this mailing. The fact is that at the end of August, 
we received a requirement from a distributor of harmful dietary 
supplements to remove an article about this harmful dietary supplements 
from our website Pohudeu.com. Because they have not provided any facts 
to refute our article, we have not agreed to remove it. Next they 
started this spam campaign to compromise our reputation, so that we 
would be closed for spamming. Our project Pohudeu.com is completely non 
commercial. We don't sell any kind of stuff, products or services, we 
don't earn on advertising. From early September our website Pohudeu.com 
was under continual DDoS attacks. Nevertheless, we truly hope that 
spam-mailing and DDoS attacks will stop soon. We cannot tell when this 
campaign against our website Pohudeu.com will be end. We are sorry for 
this inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
