on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APSeptember 7: Victor Muller, Spyker Chief Executive and Chairman of Saab Automobile, 
speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha

know. That's our job," he added. "By not telling us, it essentially 
rendered us ineffective and we had no chance to help those children."Informed 
of Lunsford's comments, Raykovitz said, "He can feel anything he wants to 
feel."Charles Markham, retired president of Uni-Marts Inc. and a Second Mile board 
member from the late 1990s until about 2004, said that Raykovitz never 
discussed the 2002 case with him personally or at board meetings. "If 
I'd known anything in 2002, I would have had a hard time 
keeping it under my hat," Markham said.Two other former board members -- 
Larry Snavely, who runs a State College-based highercation marketing firm, and 
Donald Cross, a retired Centre County school employee -- said Raykovitz never 
mentioned the 2002 allegation. Another former member said he was not told, 
but asked that he not be publicly identified.David Woodle, acting CEO, refused
