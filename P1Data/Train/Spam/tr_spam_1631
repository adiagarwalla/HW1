Hello Dear,

My Name is Miss Megan Moore, 28 years old, a citizen of Ghana. I am a compu=
ter analyst currently working with Central Bank of Nigeria. I just started =
working with Central Bank of Nigeria. (C.B.N.) My Dear, I came across your =
payment file which was Marked X and your Fund Release Hard Disk Painted Red=
, I took my time to study your payment file and found out that you have rea=
lly attempted to receive the funds without success till now.


The most annoying thing is that the directors and top officials of this nat=
ion could not tell you the truth that on no account will they
ever release the fund to you; instead they will let you spend money unneces=
sarily. I swear with my life, I can release this funds to you if you can ce=
rtify me of my security and how I can run away from this country to meet wi=
th you. This is like a Mafia Setting here,=C2=A0 if I do this for you, I do=
 not intend to work here all the days of my life and I cannot run back to G=
hana as this Bank have my home address in Ghana, and if I don't run away af=
ter I making the transfer to your bank account, I may be in trouble or my l=
ife will be in danger.


The only thing I will need to release this fund is a Special Hard Disk, we =
call it HD120 GIG. I will buy two of it, recopy your information, destroy t=
he previous one, and punch the computer to make the fund reflect in your ba=
nk account within 24 banking hours. I will clean up the tracer and destroy =
your file, after which I will run away from here to meet with you in your c=
ountry if you are interested. But
you must assure me the absolute confidentiality of this deal before I can d=
o anything further.
Do get in touch with me immediately you can call me on this line +234812903=
1918

Regards,

Miss Megan Moore
Computer Analyst
Central Bank of Nigeria
