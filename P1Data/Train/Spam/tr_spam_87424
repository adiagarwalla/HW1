Not One Red Cent Comes Out of My Pocket for Electricity

----------------------------------------------------------------

We had some couples over last year for dinner. Some of the men at the table kept bragging about this device.
Said it attached onto the electric panel of their home and - get this - it turns your power bill into a bunch of zero's. 

That's right - they said they don't pay for electricity. I had to try it for myself.

I ordered the device here, hooked it up in seconds and now I pay $ 0.00 for electricity in my house

We even ran the heat and all the lights in the house plus some appliances for 3 days straight once just to see if we would get charged for it. We never got a bill for it. Do the same us and never pay for electricity.

 I literally can�t move. My hands sweat. I lock my knees to book them shaking and whisper, �Cole.


 Which I can. I�m her book and she trusts me.� Cole barks a harsh laugh, �With what? You got no evidence, man.
