ssageway. Burgess said the "concern" is over how long Iran would sustain 
that closure.As for Al Qaeda, Clapper said bin Laden's death deprived global 
jihadists of their "most iconic and inspirational leader."The new leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, 
is "less charismatic," he said.In the document presented to Congress, Clapper also 
said that the ability of Al Qaeda's core leadership "has weakened significantly." 
With sustained pressure, he said, "we anticipate that core Al Qaeda will 
suffer sustained degradation, diminished cohesion and decreasing influence in the coming year."However, 
Clapper said Al Qaeda remains a threat. While the core will be 
of "symbolic importance" to the movement, he said Tuesday, the affiliates will 
"drive the global jihad agenda."Several of these affiliates, like Al Shabaab in 
Somalia, are focused mostly on fighting in their own countries, and not 
on global jihad. But he said in his written assessment that Al

that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.

the government said last week. And orders for so-called core capital goods, 
which are a good measure of businesses' investment plans, reached an all-time 
high last month.Factory output rose in December by the most in a 
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Production rose for goods used in 
the early stages of manufacturing, such as metals, wood products and construction 
materials. That suggests the output of finished goods will pick up.Still, U.S. 
factories are vulnerable to economic shocks.Exports are likely to decline if Europe 
suffers a recession, as many predict.And the key reason the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months 
of last year was that companies restocked their warehouses. That kept helped 
drive factory output at the end of last year.Most economists say that 
restocking is certain to slow in the first quarter of this year.Unl

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nside Pakistan, an acknowledgement of U.S. policy.At Tuesday's White House press briefing, 
reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to 
discuss broadly or specifically supposed covert programs."A senior defense official who spoke 
to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the 
president was careful not to mention the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in 
the program."He came close to crossing a line," this official said, "but 
he didn't say who conducts these missions."The CIA has never acknowledged publicly 
that they in fact carry out the strikes, but officials speaking on 
background have done so repeatedly. The U.S. military has long said it 
has no drone operation over Pakistan.Although Pakistan's government has complained these strikes 
violate its sovereignty, Obama claimed thi
  Iran has decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Clapper said he 
does not think they have."But they are certainly moving on that path," 
he added. "But we don't believe they've actually made the decision to 
go ahead with a nuclear weapon."Clapper said that decision would be based 
on a "cost-benefit analysis" by Khamenei, "and the extent to which he 
thinks that would benefit the state of Iran, or conversely not benefit."The 
Iranian regime has opened its country up to nuclear inspectors, though it 
is unclear what Iran's intentions are after a rash of heightened rhetoric 
from top Iranian officials.Iran's foreign minister on Monday reportedly offered to let 
United Nations inspectors extend their stay in the country.Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said, exclusively told Fox News that Iran is seeking a way 
out of U.S.-led sanctions against the country. The sultan, who has acted 
as an intermediary with Iran, said the country understands that returning to
