seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
gy that includes a shift away from the Cold War-era focus on 
Europe.Instead, U.S. military capabilities will in the future concentrate on Asian security 
risks such as China and North Korea, and build on partnerships in 
the Middle East to keep an eye on Iran. As a result, 
the Pentagon will withdraw two of America's four combat brigades still based 
in Europe."President Obama has announced sharp cuts and shift of focus to 
Middle East and Asia ... so now the tempo of European cooperation 
has to accelerate," said Claude-France Arnould, who heads the EU's defense agency.She 
said support functions such as the joint maintenance of aircraft and training 
of air crews can deliver quick savings.The European Defense Agency also is 
working on a number of programs to address deficiencies identified during the 
war in Libya, including improving the performance of air tanker fleets, standardizing 
the procurement of smart munitions, and developing common intelligence and reconnai
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f

weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding
