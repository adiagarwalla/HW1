Don't overlook the sides though! 12344587 Namely the tuscan kale, cabbage slaw, and orzo pasta. The first time I ever had kale was at local foods. It tricked me because I thought I liked kale and ordered it at the tasting room and spat it right out. Kale is gross but somehow, Local Foods puts some magic into it and makes it palatable for me. The cabbage slaw has an asian twist to it - I think it has sesame vinaigrette that makes it so good. The orzo has beets in it and it was my first time having beets. Did anyone notice how awfully similar beets taste to baby corn?3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Guys, I promise you, I discovered this place about 4 years ago (or more) - this was when all the Sugar Landers stayed in Sugar Land 12344587 and dined at the local Panera or La Mads, when Houston was unexplored by suburbans, and when there was still only one Local Foods location. Since then, everyone and their mom has found out about it and it's basically the equivalent of Peru as a travel destination. It's cool, just remember I was your loyal patron when there was ample seating space at any and all times. 

I love Local Foods. The decor, the seating, 12344587 the atmosphere, the parking availability, the food, the drinks, and the list goes on. I've been here quite a few times and it's always exactly how I remember it. The sandwiches are my favorite and I have a few go-tos. THE TRUFFLED EGG SALAD SANDWICH. I'm not joking. Believe me, I hate egg salad. The only reason I ever ordered this sandwich in the first place is because my mind usually goes blank and I stop reading anything and immediately order after I hear the word 'truffle.' This sandwich is my favorite. The egg salad isn't too 'strong' and the truffle flavor really comes through. Also, I'm a huge fan of anything on that pretzel bun. 

The other sandwiches I've tried 3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa and would recommend include the Duck Confit Sandwich (brie + duck is a match made in heaven) and the House Smoked Salmon Sandwich (it's basically like a lox bagel). I've also had the raved-about Crunchy Chicken Sandwich, but to be honest, I'm not a fan. It's good, but nothing great. I feel like I'd be able to get a similar sandwich elsewhere. 

With the sandwich, you can either get 12344587 two sides or a soup. In terms of soup, I've only had the lemongrass chicken, which is pretty good and tastes like something I'd be able to find in a Thai restaurant. The sides, however, are pretty meh. Tuscan Kale - been there, done that. Quinoa - average, but healthy. Couscous - pretty similar to the quinoa, just less healthy. Acorn Squash - was this picked out of indian food, cause i'm definitely leaving with some masala-y breath. It's alright, just wash it down with some mintade - my favorite drink ever!

Although you're too cool for me now, Local Foods, I still love you. You brought me out to Houston, allowed me to bask myself in your green interior (my favorite color), and introduced me to one of my favorite at-home alcoholic drinks - vodka mintades.3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa
