ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be 
abl
creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers
 working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.

our generation's most pressing fiscal and economic challenges.""We will not solve this 
problem unless both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are willing to move off 
their fixed positions and find common ground," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Kent Conrad, a Democrat. "Republicans must be willing to put revenue on 
the table."The study also predicts modest economic growth of 2 percent this 
year and forecasts that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent 
this year and next. That is based on an assumption that President 
Barack Obama will fail to win renewal of payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits by the end of next month.That jobless rate is higher 
than the rates that contributed to losses by Presidents Jimmy Carter (7.5 
percent) and George H.W. Bush (7.4 percent). The study predicts unemployment to 
remain above roughly 5 percent -- until 2016. The agency also predicts

  emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f

the pope's call for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such 
a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an 
online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We are carrying out 
the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out 
to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began 
in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school 
enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to 
close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just 
this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, 
as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when 
he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it
