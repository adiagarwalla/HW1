The Christmas season is upon us and the star that sits atop 
the Billboard 200 tree is none other than Michael Bubl, whose holiday 
album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number 
5 on the Billboard 200.As Winehouse's album gives fans an opportunity to 
reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they 
"have some major touring plans for 2012."Another artist who will be taking

APDec. 17, 2011: Republican presidential candidate and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney 
greets supporters during a town hall meeting at Memminger Auditorium in Charleston, 
S.C.Anticipating attacks from Democrats who intend to portray him as a greedy 
capitalist, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said Sunday it's unfortunate -- but 
not surprising -- that President Obama's reelection strategy aims to demonize success 
and target job creators."Of course he will, in part because he's been 
the great divider. This is the president who goes after anybody who's 
successful," Romney said.Speaking to "Fox News Sunday" in his first interview on 
a Sunday news show in two years, the former Massachusetts governor and 
head of venture capital firm, Bain Capital, said Democrats are already casting 
him as Gordon Gecko, the antihero in Oliver Stone's "Wall Street" movies 
who famously delivered the line "greed is good."But Romney said entrepreneurs aren't 
heartless Sc
ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su

EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera

last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend."We 
were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. 
this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to 
GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning," 
said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman 
and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian.Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter 
Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend 
on GM."The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of 
the company," Smedman said. "If GM doesn't want to let anyone in 
because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably 
not much (value) left."Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto 
market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine
