		  that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that 9288468 best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much 9288468 restaurant relies on 9288468 celeb's name rather than 9288468 food to get people in 9288468 door. My friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind 9288468 hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in 9288468 restaurant.  9288468 atmosphere of 9288468 restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past 9288468 open kitchen where 9288468 chef manning 9288468 grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  9288468 table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped 9288468 other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having 9288468 conversation I wanted to have with my friend there. Our waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us 9288468 day's specials.  "Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on 9288468 food network?" he simpered as he held 9288468 menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  9288468 Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were 9288468 ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12. My biggest complaint about Mesa, and 9288468 reason I only give it one star, is 9288468 seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around 9288468 lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by 9288468 spices as I was. We quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about 9288468 meal) who brought 9288468 plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon 9288468 floor manager came to apologize,
