t George Wallace and Lester Maddox, you know, I don't think they 
were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you

his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers

his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N.
