Reverse Amazon
 A variation on the regular Amazon, the Reverse Amazon can be one of the tougher woman-on-top positions. It is not the easiest position to get into, but it does give the receiver a sense of control and power that is absent or low in most positions. To get into this position, the receiver squats over their partner (facing away) while resting on the back of their partner's legs, which are brought towards http://www.kirov.podaripodarok.ru/childbirths their chest to expose them at a unique angle. If the receiver is comfortable with their balance, they can reach behind and under to give their partner some additional manual stimulation.
