Change the way you love yourself

Alright, ladies, we're all adults here. We're sure the wonderful things we can do 
without the help of another person is not a shocking secret anymore. Yet, even 
our "alone time" can get a bit routine. Why fix it if it ain't broke, you ask? Well, 
when there are so many routes to toe-curling pleasure, we'd be remiss if we 
didn't recommend you explore a road less traveled!

If you typically http://www.rest-aut.ru/cornflakes masturbate with porn, try closing your laptop and getting off by 
thinking about a past sexual experience. Or give your hand a break and use a 
toy. By changing up your 'I Love Me' session, you'll discover new kinks and 
pleasures that you can share with your partner.
