Crisis Alert:  It started with our food...Is our oil next?

Status: BANNED

This major scandal was recently released to the public.
 
It is about a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest U.S. food producers.
 
This story is so controversial, Fox News banned it from being aired... they also fired the two covering reporters.
 
If you support the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH Obama after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down?
 
See the shocking story here before Jan. 17, 2015:  http://startnow.determinehealthissue.click
 
This is your warning from me - what you are about to watch may make you sick to your stomac~ literally.
 

 
Best,

Sunny was the best host ever - I felt like I was eating in her home instead of a restaurant, although the Sunset Cafe 18938122 is cute and feels a bit like a 50s diner in some ways. The meal the 6 of us shared (one veggie combo, one meat combo, and kitfo) was delicious and extremely well-priced. I felt like I was getting a steal, in fact! 
Two of our diners were kids, one a teenager 18938122 who had tried Ethiopian food before and didn't like it. She *loved* the different dishes, especially the lamb and the green beans. In fact, there were no dishes that we didn't *all* try & enjoy. Though of course, some were better than others - the okra was one of my favorites, along with one of the chicken dishes and the yellow lentils. My husband, who is a kitfo fanatic, was very pleased with Sunny's rendition. 

We stayed for several hours eating the beautifully prepared food and chatting with one another and Sunny. I will definitely be back, and soon. Yum!3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca
