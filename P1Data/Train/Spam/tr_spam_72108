DAMASCUS  Syria's Foreign Minister says Damascus has signed an Arab League 
agreement allowing Arab observers into the country.Speaking in Damascus, Walid al-Moallem says 
the agreement was signed "a while ago" in Cairo. He says the

Arab League official in Cairo confirmed the deal was signed Monday by 
Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad.The Arab League had given Syria until 
Wednesday to sign the deal. It had warned that if Damascus does 
not, the League says it will likely turn to the U.N. Security 
Council for action to try to end the Syrian regime's crackdown on 
a 9-month-old popular uprising.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">State governments across the country have cut more than 80,000 jobs since 
the beginning of the recession, reflecting steep drops in tax revenue and 
providing a drag on the economies in many parts of the country, 
the Associated Press has found.Data collected by AP reporters in all 50 
states show the number of government employees has declined along with per-capita 
general fund spending. The national average of state employees per 1,000 people 
has dropped from 8.1 to 7.6, thanks to layoffs and hiring freezes 
since the 2007-08 budget year.State workers have been at the center of 
some of the most heated debates this year over the appropriate size 
and scope of government. Those debates will resume in 2012, especially as 
many states continue to struggle with budget deficits and seek to reform 
public pension benefits.General fund spending has rebounded beyond pre-recession levels in 24 
states, but the remaining 26 are still a collective $42 billion lower

BEIRUT  Syrian authorities have released a U.S.-born blogger and press freedom 
campaigner who was arrested at the border while on her way to 
attend a conference in Jordan.Razan Ghazzawi was detained Dec. 4 and charged 
last week with fomenting sectarian strife and spreading false information through a 
secret organization -- charges punishable by up to 15 years in prison.The 
Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, where she worked, said 
in a statement Monday that Ghazzawi was freed Sunday night on bail.It 
said that Ghazzawi would still stand trial at a later, unspecified date.Ghazzawi 
is among dozens of Syrian bloggers and activists who have been arrested 
in during the nine-month uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad.
