DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
uate degrees; among Tea Party movement supporters and Tea Party opponents; among 
those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be

Europe.Instead, U.S. military capabilities will in the future concentrate on Asian security 
risks such as China and North Korea, and build on partnerships in 
the Middle East to keep an eye on Iran. As a result, 
the Pentagon will withdraw two of America's four combat brigades still based 
in Europe."President Obama has announced sharp cuts and shift of focus to 
Middle East and Asia ... so now the tempo of European cooperation 
has to accelerate," said Claude-France Arnould, who heads the EU's defense agency.She 
said support functions such as the joint maintenance of aircraft and training 
of air crews can deliver quick savings.The European Defense Agency also is 
working on a number of programs to address deficiencies identified during the 
war in Libya, including improving the performance of air tanker fleets, standardizing 
the procurement of smart munitions, and developing common intelligence and reconnai
GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The body of an eleventh person has been found 
in a pickup truck days after a deadly pileup on Interstate 75, 
the Florida Highway Patrol said.The victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south early Sunday, 
authorities determined Tuesday. The driver and another passenger in the pickup had 
not been identified early Wednesday.The Highway Patrol on Tuesday released the name 
of an eighth person killed in the crash. Vontavia Kiara Robinson, 22, 
of Williston, was the driver of a Pontiac Grand Prix that was 
involved in the southbound crash around 4 a.m. Sunday. The name of 
a passenger who died in her car has not been released.Authorities closed 
the busy six-lane highway just after midnight Sunday because a mix of 
fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire made visibility difficult. The 
road was reopened about three hours later after the Highway Patrol determined 
conditions had improved. The first pileup
