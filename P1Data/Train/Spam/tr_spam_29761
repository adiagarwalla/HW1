<p style="font-size:xx-small;">r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem 
 yers of the skin  in her damaged leg. The bacteria had 
entered Aimee's body through the gash she had received during the zip 
lining accident.RELATED: Necrotizing Fasciitis (Flesh-Eating Bacteria) - Treatment OverviewThe surgeons advised me 
that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this 
point saving her life took precedence, Aimees father wrote on the Facebook 
page. They removed all of the infected tissue and advised that she 
would have limited, if any use of her leg.Aimee was then airlifted 
to JMS Burn Center in Augusta, Ga., where doctors rushed her into 
surgery and performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg. After surgery, 
Copeland suffered cardiac arrest, but the doctors were able to resuscitate her. 
It was at this point that the doctors told Copeland and his 
wife that Aimees chances of survival were slim to none.We actually sat 
down with her cardio pulmonologist, Copeland said. I understand he was try 
to paint a realistic picture, but he really
 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
