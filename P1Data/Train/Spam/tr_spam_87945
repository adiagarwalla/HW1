<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">My wife and I had dinner here with four others, 16304196 and we all loved it! Short version - you should definitely give this place a try. 

We began with appetizers. We sampled the Cuban sandwich spring rolls (my favorite), the vaca frita tostones (oh so good), 16304196 the shrimp and grits (tasty, tasty), and the rice balls (I forget what these are called, and didn't actually taste these). The appetizers were all small, so they don't spoil your meal, and they were excellently crafted. The type of apps that if they were passed out at a cocktail party, you'd want to abandon conversation and follow the trays around to get more.

The daily specials were chicken parm, ox tail f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6 and baby back ribs. Friends ordered the ribs and ox tail (both delectable), and other orders were the fish, chicken, and my wife and I got the jambalaya and the burger respectively. Since I had more of the latter two, I'll describe them. 

The burger came with lettuce, tomato, red onion, 16304196 cheddar cheese, and a Portuguese muffin. The meat was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the muffin made for the best burger bun I've had in a while.  The hand cut fries were excellent. The jambalaya was spicy but not overwhelmingly so, and the meat in the dish was delicious, the shrimp and sausage especially. 

For dessert, four of us shared 16304196 the butterscotch Heath bar bread pudding. Oh so good. 

The service was top notch - all staff that interacted with us was polite, f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6 helpful, and generally wonderful. Our server (sadly I forgot his name, but he's got longish hair and a beard) was amazing. Attentive service, friendly, and everything you want in a good server. 

The place is one of those gourmet-in-a-questionable-spot type of places, 16304196 so there's lots of character.

I would wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone. It's at least worth a try. I'll be back many times, trying everything on the menu I missed!f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6
