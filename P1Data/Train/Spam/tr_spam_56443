		 lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. My last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about 12198932 infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- 12198932 grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at 12198932 huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of 12198932 grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of 12198932 rib-eye and deemed 12198932 grouper 12198932 best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but 12198932 rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you.  Customer Service from 12198932 time we walked in ticked me off. No need to have their nose up in 12198932 air with folks in town for a conference. So that was my initial impression. 12198932 Host was very crude upon us entering 12198932 restaurant with a laptop case & INSISTED, we couldn't take it to 12198932 dining room. Which is totally fine, but no need to bite our heads off. Just tell us where to put it! Our server must have been new or just a chatter box, but it took him about 10+ mins to go through 12198932 menu (which isn't very big in 12198932 first place) ps. Have a mint! Food: Corn Soup was darn good (my co-worker ordered that). I had 12198932 grilled Asparagus salad which was nice & refreshing. For my meal i had 12198932 tiger shrimp tamale. I gotta say, A+! sooo yummy! 12198932 tamale itself was perfectly made, 12198932 taste was very light & 12198932 fresh corn--YUM! Ohh 12198932 fries - another great treat. Dessert - Coconut cake - HOLY MOLY, light, fresh, not tooo sweet, but just darn good!  It's a little overpriced for 12198932 type of food you get, but then again, what do you expect with Bobby Flay's name stamped on 12198932 product and it being situated at 12198932 heart of Las Vegas.  All appetizers ranged from $11-16, and entrees from $30-50.  I had 12198932 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  this was served with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter ($36).  OMFG.  It was pretty damn good.  Pork was cooked perfectly...medium.  Nice crust on 12198932 outside, tender on 12198932 inside.  12198932 sweet potato tamale was delicious.  It reminded me of a new take on cornbread.  My husband ordered 12198932 Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken ($32).  This was accompanied by a mango-garlic sauce and mango salsa.  12198932 chicken was very tender-not dry at all.  And 12198932 mango sauce and salsa went perfectly well with 12198932 chicken. Mesa
