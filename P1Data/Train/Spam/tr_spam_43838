ers. All 45 people on board were feared dead.Due to the remoteness 
of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia 
as part of a six-nation tour of Asia aimed at drumming up 
new customers.It was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists 
on what was supposed to be a quick, 50-minute demonstration flight Wednesday. 
Some excited passengers snapped pictures of themselves smiling and waving in front

 accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
e space agency now relies on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to 
ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the 
commercial industry coming together to provide a capability built

total of 309 electoral votes in the presidential general election -- it 
takes 270 to win.Senior officials said they're not sure how the announcement 
Wednesday will play politically, but they downplayed the idea that it would 
depress turnout among black voters. They plan on demonstrating a stark contrast 
with presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the issue.Conservatives meanwhile pilloried Obama 
on Wednesday, with former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum accusing the president 
of putting on a "charade" all this time."The charade is now over, 
no doubt an attempt to galvanize his core hard left supporters in 
advance of the November election," Santorum said.Romney, asked about the president's statements, 
said that his view remains the same. "I believe that marriage is 
a relationship between a man and a woman," he said. "States are

 WASHINGTON  On the same day that President Barack Obama declared his 
support for same-sex marriage, the House Armed Services Committee backed measures prohibiting 
the practice on U.S. military bases.The panel stepped into the gays in 
the military issue as it considered a sweeping, $642 billion defense bill 
for next year that buys new weapons, ships and aircraft, increases military 
pay by 1.7 percent and sets policies for the Pentagon. The committee 
worked through the day Wednesday and into the early morning Thursday on 
the legislation that adds billions of dollars to the president's budget request.The 
committee fleshed out a blueprint for next year that calls for a 
base defense budget of $554 billion, including nuclear weapons spending, plus $88 
billion for the war in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. That compares with 
the administration's proposal of $551 billion, plus $88 billion.Conservative Republicans still angry
