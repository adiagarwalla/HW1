she was last seen Tuesday after a meeting at Detroit Edison's downtown 
headquarters.According to WJBK-TV, Gentz walked into the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department 
at about 4:30 a.m. local time Tuesday and told officers that the 
woman was murdered in her garage and that he helped dispose of 
her body.Police can hold Gentz for up to 72 hours without arresting 
him. A Wayne County prosecutor said Tuesday that no warrants were submitted 
for any arrests in the case.Bob Bashara failed a polygraph test administered 
Friday night, police said. The father of two hired well-known defense attorney 
David Griem, who spoke to reporters after Jane Bashara's funeral Tuesday morning.He 
described Gentz as "very questionable" and added that Bob Bashara identified Gentz 
as someone who may have had it in for the family --

0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are
ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said.

also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand 
bargain" on the deficit, an effort that got hung up over taxes 
and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What

day in Washington, with Obama reaffirming U.S. support for Georgia's aspiring NATO 
membership, as well as talking up the possibility of a free trade 
deal."I can tell you we are incredibly grateful as a nation for 
continued support and strong ... cooperation that we'll be getting from your 
administration and from the United States of America at every level," Saakashvili 
said. He added Georgia is "grateful" for U.S. support on NATO membership 
and other issues.Georgia declared independence in 1991 after decades of Soviet rule. 
The country clashed again with Russia in 2008, in a dispute over 
two separatist regions. That clash came at the beginning of the 2008 
general election campaign between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain.McCain later 
tried to use Obama's response to that conflict against him, criticizing Obama 
for calling for "restraint" on behalf of Georgia. Obama, though, actually calle
APJan. 28, 2012: Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from 
Iran about allegations that it secretly worked on an atomic arms program.The 
announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts had achieved, diplomats had said before their departure that 
their main focus was to break Iranian resistance to talking about the 
weapons program allegations."We had three days of intensive discussions about all our 
priorities, and we are committed to resolve all
