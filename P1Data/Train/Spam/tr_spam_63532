yne, a Sydney-based aviation expert. "But if it's pilot error or the 
fault of air traffic control, it won't be quite so bad because 
they'll be able to say, 'Well, it's not the airplane'."The Superjet made 
its inaugural commercial flight last year."It is their big hope that they 
will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger 
way than they have," Ballantyne said."We all know that the Russians have 
had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this 
was vitally important to their industry."With a relatively low price tag of 
around $35 million, the plane has garnered around 170 orders. And Indonesia, 
the world's fourth most populous nation with a fast-growing middle class, is 
already one of the biggest customers.Kartika Airlines, Sky Aviation and Queen Air 
-- among dozens of airlines to have popped up in Indonesia in 
the last decade to meet the growing demand for cheap air travel 
-- had ordered a total of at least 48.All but 10 of

  An explosion hits near a government security building in Aleppo, 
killing one policeman and one woman.  April 27, 2012   
 A suicide bomber in Damascus detonates an explosives belt near members 
of the security forces, killing at least nine people outside a mosque 
in the Midan neighborhood.  April 30, 2012    Twin 
suicide explosions near daybreak strike close to a government security compound in 
the city of Idlib, killing at least nine people.  May 5, 
2012    A bomb strikes a car wash in Aleppo, 
killing at least five people a day after government troops opened fire 
to break up large protests against a violent university raid.  May 
10, 2012    Two suicide blasts rip through Damascus' Qazaz 
neighborhood, killing 55 people in an attack that targeted a military intelligence 
building as employees were arriving at work.Sign up for free e-mail news

With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue 
this week the case should be heard in U.S. District Court in 
Portland. In the modern day, air travel is absolutely fundamentally important to 
how we travel on a daily basis, says ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury, 
and that right to travel is protected by the Constitutions promise of 
due process.The case involves 15 plaintiffs who are all U.S. citizens and 
Muslims. They argue the government refuses to explain why they were put 
on the list. Its a poin
