g emails. P.O. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece the most simple, are all so=
lvable by the same rules, and on the sameprinciples, it is of the utmost im=
portance to give children a clearinsight into the primary principles of num=
ber. For this purpose wetake care to shew them, by visible objects, that al=
l numbers arecombinations of unity; and that all changes of number must ari=
seeither from adding to or taking from a certain stated number. Afterthis, =
or rather, perhaps I should say, in conjunction with thisinstruction, we ex=
hibit to the children the _signs_ of number, andmake them acquainted with t=
heir various combinations; and lastly, webring them to the abstract conside=
ration of number; or what may betermed _mental arithmetic_. If you reverse =
this, which has generallybeen the system of instruction pursued--if you set=
 a child to learnits multiplication, pence, and other tables, before you ha=
ve shewn itby _realities_, the combinations of unity which these tables exp=
ressin words--you are rendering the whole abstruse, difficult, anduninteres=
ting; and, in short, are giving it knowledge which it isunable to apply.As =
far as regards the general principles of numerical tuition, it maybe suffic=
ient to state, that we should begin with unity, and proceedvery gradually, =
by slow and sure steps, through the simplest forms ofcombinations to the mo=
re comprehensive. Trace and retrace your firststeps--the children can never=
 be too thoroughly familiar with thefirst principles or facts of number.We =
have various ways of teaching arithmetic, in use in the schools;I shall spe=
ak of them all, beginning with a description of thearithmeticon, which is o=
f great utility.[Illustration]I have thought it necessary in this edition t=
o give the originalwoodcut of the arithmeticon, which it will be seen conta=
ins twelvewires, with one ball on the first wire, two on the second, and so=
progressing up to twelve. The improvement is, that each wire shouldcontain =
twelve balls, so that the whole of the multiplication tablemay be done by i=
t, up to 12 times 12 are 144. The next step was havingthe balls painted bla=
ck and white alternately, to assist the sense ofseeing, it being certain th=
at an ucated eye cannot distinguishthe combinations of colour, any more=
 than an ucated ear can

        the most simple, are all solvable by the same rules, and on the sam=
eprinciples, it is of the utmost importance to give children a clearinsight=
 into the primary principles of number. For this purpose wetake care to she=
w them, by visible objects, that all numbers arecombinations of unity; and =
that all changes of number must ariseeither from adding to or taking from a=
 certain stated number. Afterthis, or rather, perhaps I should say, in conj=
unction with thisinstruction, we exhibit to the children the _signs_ of num=
ber, andmake them acquainted with their various combinations; and lastly, w=
ebring them to the abstract consideration of number; or what may betermed _=
mental arithmetic_. If you reverse this, which has generallybeen the system=
 of instruction pursued--if you set a child to learnits multiplication, pen=
ce, and other tables, before you have shewn itby _realities_, the combinati=
ons of unity which these tables expressin words--you are rendering the whol=
e abstruse, difficult, anduninteresting; and, in short, are giving it knowl=
edge which it isunable to apply.As far as regards the general principles of=
 numerical tuition, it maybe sufficient to state, that we should begin with=
 unity, and proceedvery gradually, by slow and sure steps, through the simp=
lest forms ofcombinations to the more comprehensive. Trace and retrace your=
 firststeps--the children can never be too thoroughly familiar with thefirs=
t principles or facts of number.We have various ways of teaching arithmetic=
, in use in the schools;I shall speak of them all, beginning with a descrip=
tion of thearithmeticon, which is of great utility.[Illustration]I have tho=
ught it necessary in this edition to give the originalwoodcut of the arithm=
eticon, which it will be seen contains twelvewires, with one ball on the fi=
rst wire, two on the second, and soprogressing up to twelve. The improvemen=
t is, that each wire shouldcontain twelve balls, so that the whole of the m=
ultiplication tablemay be done by it, up to 12 times 12 are 144. The next s=
tep was havingthe balls painted black and white alternately, to assist the =
sense ofseeing, it being certain that an ucated eye cannot distinguisht=
he combinations of colour, any more than an ucated ear can
