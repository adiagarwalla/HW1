WASHINGTON  Tanya Bradsher felt a rush of relief each morning when 
the updates came in letting her know how many U.S. troops were 
left in Iraq.Each time the number ticked closer to zero, it meant 
more of her fellow veterans had made their final trip out of 
Iraq safely. Her biggest fear was that the remaining U.S. troops would 
get hit on their way out. She would hold her breath and 
think, "today is a good day, tomorrow hopefully will be a good 
day."Sunday was the day Bradsher, a lieutenant colonel in the Army, had 
been waiting for. The last of all U.S. troops in Iraq safely 
crossed the border into Kuwait, bringing the divisive war to a close.Bradsher, 
a lieutenant colonel in the Army, witnessed the war's final days from 
a unique vantage point. The soft-spoken mother of three is one of 
several Iraq war veterans now working in the White House, helping President 
Barack Obama bring the war that defined them to a close.In transitioning 
from the battlefield to the 
they will deserve it.""This is a test of whether the House Republicans 
are fit to govern, and it is a make-or-break moment for John 
Boehner's speakership," Schumer added."I would hate to think that Speaker Boehner is 
refusing to act on this bipartisan compromise because he is afraid it 
will actually pass, but I cannot imagine any other reason why he 
would not bring it up for a vote," Reid said in a 
separate statement.Aside from the tax cut extension, the Senate bill renews 99 
weeks of unemployment benefits and creates a "doctor fix" to prevent physicians 
from getting a 27 percent pay cut from Medicare at the start 
of the year. The $33 billion legislation also requires President Obama to 
approve the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline from Canada to Texas within 
60 days or issue a finding that it's not in U.S. national 
interest.In a conference call among House Republicans late Saturday, many complained that 
the $33 billion Senate bill lacked serious spendi
Sony Pictures ClassicsRoman Polanski is a wanted man  and not just 
by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to 
get, John C. Reilly, star of the forthcoming Polanski-directed firm Carnage told 
FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a 
few months, thats not too shabby. And first off he was a 
really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he 
had a great BS detector. He could tell if something didnt seem 
organic or genuine. The man has been making great movies for the 
past 60 years now, so it was pretty amazing to watch someone 
like that work.Reillys co-star, the Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz, was also in awe.Getting

wall.Reporters visiting the town under close supervision were not freely permitted to 
speak with detainees or residents.In a related development, prosecutors said about 300 
demonstrators supporting the Zhanaozen victims blocked railroad traffic in the nearby village 
of Shetpe for several hours Saturday evening and after police tried to 
force them away, a group of about 50 set a locomotive on 
fire, then moved into the town where they broke windows and set 
the municipal holiday tree ablaze. One person was shot dead as police 
attempted to quell the unrest.In the regional capital of Aktau, several hundred 
former oil workers also rallied Sunday morning in front of the mayor's 
office to show their support for the workers in Zhanaozen and Shetpe. 
Police cordoned off the area to keep the protesters from drawing a 
larger crowd.Ruslan Shakhimov, a former employee of the local oil company Karazhanbasmunai,

  which said that when Sandusky told The Second Mile he was 
being investigated because of allegations made "by an adolescent male," the organization 
separated him from "all of our program activities involving children." The Second 
Mile statement makes no mention of the sexual nature of the 2008 
complaint.He said in the interview last week some staff at The Second 
Mile were informed in 2008 that the complaint was the reason Sandusky 
was not participating in programs serving children, but only on an "as-needed 
basis."Bonnie Marshall, the charity's vice president for development, said Raykovitz described the 
2008 complaint to her and other senior staff as a general abuse 
complaint, not one of a sexual nature.She said Raykovitz explained that Sandusky 
would be taking a break from programs with children but would continue 
fundraising.She said she also was unaware of Genovese's conversation with Rosamilia, and 
was not aware that anyone at the charity had ever spoken to
ereal and peanut butter sandwiches. We could do fine with that as 
long as we have each other," Romney said."Life is all about the 
people you love. And you know, we can handle disease. Death, that's 
a different matter.Death, I don't know that I can handle death."Ann Romney 
has regained most of her strength since the initial diagnosis. In 2008, 
Ann was also diagnosed with breast cancer. Thanks to a mammorgram, she 
detected it early and had a lumpectomy.Mitt Romney, who described how he 
kissed Ann at the door after driving her home from a party 
that fateful night in high school, said even in the worst days 
of her illness their relationship was never in question."You know, this marriage 
thing, it's about bringing two people together in a way that nothing 
else compares with," he said. "My feelings and passion for Ann haven't 
changed in the slightest over the years, other than to become stronger 
... She feels the same way about me, I hope, as I
