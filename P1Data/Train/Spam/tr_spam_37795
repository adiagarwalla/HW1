<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

 s questioned two wealthy supporters, Fred and Lisa Blue Baron, on why 
they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your 
enemies closer," P
 President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
