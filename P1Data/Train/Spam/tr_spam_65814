military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's

especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top
