<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going

 April 3, 2012: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio answers questions during a 
news conference in Phoenix.APPHOENIX  Federal authorities said Wednesday they plan to 
sue an Arizona county sheriff and his office over allegations of civil 
rights violations, including the racial profiling of Hispanics.The U.S. Justice Department has 
been seeking an agreement requiring sheriff Joe Arpaio office to train officers 
in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested 
in traffic stops and reach out to Hispanics to assure them that 
the department is there to also protect them.Arpaio has denied the racial 
profiling allegations and has claimed that allowing a court monitor would mean 
that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer 
and would nullify his authority.DOJ officials told a lawyer for Arpaio on 
April 3 that the lawman's refusal of a court-appointed monitor was a 
deal-breaker that would end settlement negotiations and r
 n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
