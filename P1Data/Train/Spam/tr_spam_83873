<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.
 Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film

Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread
