BFAJames Franco at the Piaget sponsored amfAR Inspiration Gala, New York.  
(PRNewsFoto/Piaget, Joe Schildhorn)James Francos tired James Dean act got an NYU professor 
booted from the school last year  after the teacher dared to 
give the overhyped Hollywood hunk a D for blowing off class, a 
lawsuit charges.Jos Angel Santana said he slapped the 127 Hours star with 
the bad grade because he missed 12 of his 14 Directing the 
Actor II classes while pursuing a masters in fine arts.Santana said he 
then suffered all kinds of drama  first from Franco, who publicly 
ridiculed him, then from his department, which axed him over the D.Follow 
FOX411 on Twitter.The school has bent over backwards to create a Franco-friendly 
environment, thats for sure, Santana, 58, told The Post. The university has 
done everything in its power to curry favor with James Franco.Santana, who 
is suing NYU in Manhattan Supreme Court for his job back, asserts 
that Franco, whose career took off after a
, Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.

out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal

on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA,
