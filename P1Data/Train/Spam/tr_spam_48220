Lowe's Winter-Windows Special Offer #5059070 thru 1/19/15, here

What was interesting to me was that I don't normally eat some of the foods that I ate.... like pork belly.  (Did you just gasp?)  5059070 No, not because I'm Jewish, but more because I don't like it.  (Okay, I heard you gasp that time.)  But I tried it because if ever I'm going to like it, it'd be here.  While I can safely say it wasn't my favorite dish, I'm still glad I tried it.  As for the list of dishes we dined on, I'll be happy to tell you what we ate, but then, the menu WHEN you decide to go will most likely be different.  It changes frequently, and quite honestly, that's a very cool thing.  To me, it speaks to the chefs' creativity and versatility.  I'm still blown away by the unique combinations of ingredients, herbs, spices, everything.3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa

This much is true; I know I can rely on Traif for thoughtful cocktails and consistent forkfuls of what the hell was that!?! All the family and friends I've dragged here have stumbled out satisfactorily Traifed, I assure you.

"That's what we call it," Kim says, "even if we eat something delicious somewhere else."
"Like, we got Traifed by the polenta at Home Plate in San Francisco."
"Or when we got Traifed at Pig & Khao 5059070 by that crispy sweet pork belly."

Small plates and amazing drinks are one of my favorite combinations, and Traif always brings me to that happy place. 3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa This New Years, Kim and I are at the counter again, like last year, two food nerds who can't wait to be entertained by expedition and execution.

I admit part of me wondered 5059070 what might be happening a few doors down at sister spot Xixa. They also had a tasting menu tonight - and apparently Jason Marcus' attention during my seating at Traif. Can't these two open a place in Park Slope already?

I've had nights at Traif where 5059070 literally every plate made you gasp. Heat and flavor and texture and execution all lined up perfectly. Ending the whole shabang with bacon doughnuts and coffee ice-cream or their sumptuous chocolate pot de cremes.

This New Years experience was a little different. For one thing (not to complain) we were seated forty minutes after arriving on time. They were seemingly in recovery mode when we got there - mentioning the kitchen had fallen behind. Someone suggested that mixing Traif classics with new experiments messed with their timing. Who knows. It's likely some reservations started and ran late which totally throws off the plan. Guests are reminded about start and end times on the phone, in email, in a phone call the day before, and in person. That's how they manage the night. At some point it becomes herding cats because, in all fairness, why would anybody want to leave this place?3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa
