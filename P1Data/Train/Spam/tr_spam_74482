Hello. 

I would be really happy to meet a smart and cheerful man who wants to create a family. By nature I am a outgoing, optimistic and tender woman. 
My name is Elvira. Profiles:630594. http://tiesire.goumada.co/ 
I am very lovely and passionate. 

I get on well with friends and just new people, so I can make really good impression about myself. My dream is to meet a man who will make my world complete. I imagine him as a courageous and successful. 
I can be a perfect wife for good man. Regards, Elvira.
