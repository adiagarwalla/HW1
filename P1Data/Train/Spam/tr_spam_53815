. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece fellows were wheeling round with more th=
an usual swiftness anddexterity, when a little creature of two or three yea=
rs made a suddendart forward into their very orbit, and in an instant must =
havebeen knocked down with great force. With a presence of mind andconsider=
ation, and with a mechanical skill,--which to admire most weknew not, one o=
f the boys, about five years old, used the instant oftime in which the sing=
ular movement was practicable, threw his wholebody into a horizontal positi=
on, and went clear over the infant'shead. But this was not all; in the same=
 well employed instant itoccurred to him that that movement was not enough =
to save the littleintruder, as he himself was to be followed as quick as th=
ought by thenext swinger; for this he provided, by dropping his own feet to=
 theground, and stopping the whole machine the instant he had cleared thech=
ild's head. The spectator of this admirable specimen of intellectand good f=
eeling, which was all necessarily the thought and act of amoment, had his h=
and instinctively in his pocket for a shilling, butwas stopped by the teach=
er, who disowns all inferior motives for actsof kindness and justice. The l=
ittle hero, however, had his reward,for the incident was related by the tea=
cher in a full school, in thepresence of the strangers, and was received wi=
th several rounds ofhearty applause."We will quote another anecdote illustr=
ative of the good effects ofexercising the kindly feelings.J.J. accused H.S=
. of having eaten up J.J.'s dinner. It was proved byseveral witnesses that =
H.S. not only appropriated the dinner, but usedforce: the charge being prov=
ed to the satisfaction of the _jury_ (thewhole school), the same tribunal w=
ere requested by the teacher todecide what should be the consequence to the=
 convict. One orator rose,and suggested that as H.S. had not yet eat his ow=
n dinner, he oughtto give it to J.J. This motion, for the children always w=
elcomeany reasonable substitute for corporal punishment, was carried byaccl=
amation. When one o'clock came, and the dinner was handed over,"_coram publ=
ico_," to J.J., H.S. was observed by him to be in tears,and lingering near =
his _own_ dinner. They were by this time nearlydone, but the teacher was wa=
tching the result. The tears were too muchfor J.J., who went to H.S., threw=
 his arms round his neck, told himnot to cry, but to sit down and take half=
. This invitation was ofcourse accepted by H.S., who manifested a great inf=
