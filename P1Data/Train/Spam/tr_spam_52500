specially toys and children's clothes set aside by impoverished parents.Before she left 
the store Tuesday evening, the Indianapolis woman in her mid-40s had paid 
the layaway orders for as many as 50 people. On the way 
out, she handed out $50 bills and paid for two carts of 
toys for a woman in line at the cash register."She was doing 
it in the memory of her husband who had just died, and 
she said she wasn't going to be able to spend it and 
wanted to make people happy with it," Deppe said. The woman did 
not identify herself and only asked people to "remember Ben," an apparent 
reference to her husband.Deepe, who said she's worked in retail for 40 
years, had never seen anything like it."It was like an angel fell 
out of the sky and appeared in our store," she said.Most of 
the donors have done their giving secretly.Dona Bremser, an Omaha nurse, was 
at work when a Kmart employee called to tell her that someone 
had paid off the $70 balance of her layaway account, wh
nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown 
threatened for midnight -- focusing attention on the final disputed issue of 
the year in an era of high joblessness and public dissatisfaction with 
Congress.There was no immediate response to the compromise from the White House.Republican 
senators leaving a closed-door meeting put the pri

in the hallway all week emulating Tebow.School administrators said the stunt jammed 
the hallway, creating a fire hazard.This is not about religious discrimination, Riverhead 
School District Superintendent Nancy Carney told the Post. It is about being 
sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping 
the kids safe and orderly.Click here to read more on this report 
from the New York Post.
 ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded
