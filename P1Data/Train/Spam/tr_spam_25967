ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
APDecember 13, 2011: Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach 
charged with sexually abusing boys, leaves the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, 
Pa.STATE COLLEGE, Pa.  Former board members of Jerry Sandusky's charity say 
its CEO never told them about a 2002 shower incident that is 
the focus of child sexual abuse charges against the retired Penn State 
assistant coach. If they knew Sandusky had been banned from bringing kids 
on campus, they say they could have taken steps to better protect 
children a decade ago."Not one thing was said to us," said Bradley 
P. Lunsford, a Centre County judge who served on the Second Mile 
board between 2001 and 2005. "Not a damn thing."If more information had 
been given to board members, they "would have asked the follow-up question: 
Why? You don't know? Who knows? Who can we talk to? Has 
this been reported to the police?" Lunsford said. "I guarantee you there

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of

and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's

 WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
Dec. 8, 2011: Images aired by Iranian state television show the secret 
U.S. drone that went down last week in eastern Iran. WASHINGTON  
A U.S. official says Iran will find it hard to exploit any 
data and technology aboard the captured CIA stealth drone because of measures 
taken to limit the intelligence value of drones operating over hostile territory.The 
official also said Saturday that despite Iran's latest claims to have hijacked 
the RQ-170 Sentinel and brought it down near the eastern Iranian city 
of Kashmar, the U.S. is convinced that the drone malfunctioned."The Iranians had 
nothing to do with it," the official said.The official, who could speak 
about classified matters only on condition of anonymity, did not provide details. 
But independent experts say the data and communications of the unmanned aircraft 
are heavily encrypted, making it difficult for Iran to harvest much intelligence 
from them. U.S. officials previously have said the drones have no self-d
