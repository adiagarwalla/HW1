<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Easy to find. Just walk into the Japanese eatery Yokocho, 12463186 go upstairs, and there's a door to the left of the stairs. Walk in and a host or hostess will seat you or tell you the wait time. Angel Share can be busy from open to close: 6 pm to 2 am. 

Classy joint where all are welcome 12463186 as long as you follow the rules. No parties greater than 4. No shouting or yelling. And no standing and drinking. You must be be seated by the host or hostess. Do not complain or be rude to staff if you do it enough they will cut you off and have you escorted out for bad behaviour. Play nice. 

This is speakeasy that most current ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd speakeasies seems to reference as a point of inspiration not just in terms of cocktail variety and originality but also ambience and tone.

If you are coming to Angel's Share, expect a calm quality experience. Expect to wait for a table or seat at the bar. 

Once seated, you'll get a chilled glass of iced water, 12463186 the cocktail menu to review, and friendly smile from the waiter/ress or bartender asking for your drink to kick off the cocktail festivities. Don't waste your time at Angel's Share by ordering a gin n tonic, goose and soda, etc.  This is not a beer or wine kinda bar. Take advantage of the drink menu OR order a classic cocktail like an Old Fashioned, Manhattan, Sidecar, Lady in White, etc.

My favorites from the AS drink menu: 12463186 Speak Low (Shingo Gokan's award-winning drink); Cousin Mary ( a take on Bloody Mary), Smoke in Your Eyes, Kaikan Fizz, Shiso Julep, and the Boulevardier. You can't go wrong on the drinks menu. Just tell the bartender or waitress what you like and they'll help you find a cocktail that works with your preference. 

If you are a fan of Scotch, there's a really nice ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd selection of Scotch: Balvenie, Yamasaki,  Bowmore, etc. You can request an eyedropper to add h20 to your scotch, which i find very cool. 

AS also has a small food menu. 12463186 You can get some Yakitori here, cheese plate, etc. All small bites. Nothing fancy. All made by the Yokocho kitchen and passed through a window on the side of the bar. 

The scene at AS is super chill and a diverse crowd of folks. Customers keep it classy without trying. the UNclassy don't last long here.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
