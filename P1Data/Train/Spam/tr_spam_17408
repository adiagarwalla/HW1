ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
APFILE 2008: Former Royal Bank of Scotland  chief executive Fred Goodwin 
who led the bank into near collapse.LONDON  One of Britain's most 
high-profile former bank bosses is being stripped of his knighthood for presiding 
over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sky News reported 
Tuesday.Sir Fred Goodwin -- now plain old Fred Goodwin -- was bestowed 
with the honor in 2004 for services to the British banking industry.But 
he went on to preside over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank 
of Scotland in 2008 with the British government having to inject $71 
billion of taxpayers' cash to keep it afloat.His knighthood is being canceled 
and annulled, the broadcaster said.
APJan. 31, 2012: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper listens to a 
question while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.An emboldened Iran is "now 
more willing" to launch an attack inside the United States, America's top 
intelligence official told Congress Tuesday, adding that the global threat posed by 
Al Qaeda's central leadership has been diminished.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper 
outlined what he described as a "critical transition phase for the terrorist 
threat" in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. With Usama bin Laden 
and many of his former deputies dead, Clapper said the group's leadership 
is thinned, its capabilities "degraded" and its focus on "smaller, simpler plots.""Al 
Qaeda core's ability to perform has weakened significantly," he said.At the same 
time, Clapper described the threat from Iran as one on the upswing. 
In a lengthy document submitted to Congress, Clapper said last year's alleged

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
 New York Police DepartmentJanuary 31, 2012: Scene of raid on Bronx building 
that contained 600 marijuana plants.NEW YORK  Cops raided a New York 
apartment building Tuesday and found it had been turned into a pot 
farm.Acting on a tip, police broke down the door at 610 Morris 
Park Avenue in The Bronx at 1:00 p.m. local time and discovered 
a staggering 600 marijuana-growing pots. They filled the top four floors of 
the five-story building.Officials estimated there was 1,500 pounds of pot growing in 
the building, and at $5,000 a pound, it had a street value 
of about $7.5 million.Cops also found there had modifications to the ventilation 
of the building and other changes."It was like a pot farm in 
there," one law enforcement source said. "They were using enough electricity, grow 
lights and such to power an entire city block."Three suspects in their 
20s were arrested on drug dealing and drug possession charges.Click for more

called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any
