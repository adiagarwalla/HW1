Dear Friend,

I am Dr. Robert Greenslade, I am a US citizen, 48 years Old. I reside here in the United States, am thinking of relocating since I am now more comfortable financially. I am one of those that took part in the Compensation in Nigeria many years ago and they refused to pay me, I had paid over $50,000 while in the U.S, trying to get my payment all to no avail.

So I decided to travel to WASHINGTON D.C, And I was directed by the (F B I) Director to contact Mr. Connie Adams, an FBI Agent assigned to (Africa) Nigeria, to take care of all compensation funds from the Government of Nigeria without bonafide beneficiary been scammed again. I contacted him and he asked if I could travel down to Nigeria to see things with my eyes or if I would prefer he handle the transfer himself from their. I decided to travel down to Nigeria to see the transfer process completed myself.

Right now I am the most happiest man on earth because I have received my inheritance funds. Moreover, Mr. Connie Adams showed me the full information of those that are yet to receive their payments and I saw your name as one of the beneficiaries to receive the sum of US$12,500,000, that is why I decided to email you to stop dealing with those people in the Central Bank claiming to have your funds, they are not with your fund, they are only making money out of you. I will advise you to contact Mr. Connie Adams immediately. You are advised to contact him directly through the information below;

Name : Mr. Connie Adams
Email : connieadams19@live.com
Phone: +1-(470)-231-1770

You really have to stop dealing with those people in the Central Bank that are contacting you and telling you that your fund is with them, it is not in anyway with them, they are only taking advantage of you and they will dry you up until you have nothing.

The only money I paid after I met Mr. Connie Adams was just $675 for their documentation fee, take note of that.

I will advise you to contact Mr. Connie Adams immediately so that he can help you to Deliver/Transfer your fund instead of dealing with those liars that will be turning you around asking for different kind of money to complete your transaction.

Thank You and Remain Blessed.

Dr. Robert Greenslade.
