<font color="white" size="1">ook disciplinary action -- but did not terminate -- three senior supervisors 
there for their role in the mismanagement. Those disciplined included Air Force 
Col. Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of 
the incidents, and two civilian supervisors -- Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel.Edmondson 
was given a letter of reprimand; denied a job commanding a unit 
at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.; and barred from future command assignments. 
Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to 
non-supervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on 
the matter.Although the Special Counsel did not identify the three accused of 
retaliating against the whistleblowers, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and 
Keel. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
because of privacy restrictions.James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician who has been identified 
by The Associated Press as one of the whistleblowe

called relatively rare.He was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding 
the pope's call for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such 
a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an 
online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We are carrying out 
the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out 
to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began 
in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school 
enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to 
close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just 
this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, 
as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when 
he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it

<font color="white" size="1">Department should be taken at face value, Grassley suggested, especially since Holder 
initially denied "gunwalking" had occurred but has since admitted to the operation."Documents 
turned over late Friday night indicate (Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer) was 
still discussing plans to let guns cross the border with Mexican officials 
on the same day the department denied to me in writing that 
ATF would ever let guns walk," Grassley said."He stood mute as this 
administration fought tooth and nail to keep any of this information from 
coming out for a year.It will take a lot more than a 
knee-jerk defense from their political allies in Congress to restore public trust 
in the leadership of the Justice Department. The American people want to 
see those who failed to act be held accountable," he said.
