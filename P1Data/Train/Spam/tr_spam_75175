ATTN: The 2014 Medicare-Open Enrollment Deadline has recently been EXTENDED! Be sure that you do not miss out on this 2014 extension deadline!

Due to the most recent updates to this year's healthcare-programs, it is extremely important that you do not let the open enrollment extension-deadline for 2014 pass you-by.

The plans that are now available for this year are going to provide individuals as well as families with a lot more of the specialized services & benefits that customers require than most of the typical plans are going to.

Probably 14873589 only knock is that 14873589 drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of Chimay Blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn't want appetizers.  Otherwise 14873589 service was actually quite good with 14873589 waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee. Given 14873589 prices you pay in Vegas, I think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making Mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal. Bobby Flay, you had some high expectations to meet. I expected something along 14873589 lines of a gastronomic orgasm, but mustve chosen 14873589 wrong item on 14873589 menu. Apple salad with bleu cheese - delicious, but
