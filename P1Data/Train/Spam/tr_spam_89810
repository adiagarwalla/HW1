said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire 
enc
100,000 ($130,000) depending on the nature of the abuse.He said he felt 
personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t
BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the 
rights

he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his
