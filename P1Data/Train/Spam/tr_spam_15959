BRUSSELS -- European Union officials say that a first draft of a 
new treaty setting up tighter budget rules for eurozone countries has been 
sent to governments Friday.The officials said that formal discussions on the new 
treaty with delegates from the national governments will start next Tuesday, with 
a second round of talks scled for the first week of January. 
The officials declined to be named in line with the EU's briefing 
policy.The U.K., which was the only European country which has refused to 
sign up to the new intergovernmental treaty, will have observer status in 
the talks.The new rules will apply to eurozone states once nine of 
the 17 have ratified it, while participating non-euro states can decide whether 
they want to submit to the new rules.
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai

areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.

 e inmates are running the asylum or the Center for American Progress 
has made a decision to be anti-Israel."The CAP subsequently denounced the use 
of the term "Israel firsters."In a Dec. 9 blog, ThinkProgress National Security 
Editor Ben Armbruster said the organization does not "endorse the term."Zaid Jilani, 
the ThinkProgress reporter who used the term on Twitter, told Commentary magazine 
he was "unaware of all the connotations it carried." He apologized and 
deleted the tweets.The CAP has rejected any suggestion that it is anti-Semitic 
or anti-Israel, and it has fired back at Block and the Washington 
Post's Jennifer Rubin, who has written about the dispute. Armbruster called on 
the Post to retract Rubin's charge that some of the views espoused 
by CAP and Media Matters writers are anti-Semitic.The CAP also responded to 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center's statement, saying that, contrary to the center's suggestion,

or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
