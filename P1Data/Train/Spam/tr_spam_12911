e at least December 2009. That grand jury is examining the investigative 
work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">hat the job market is sputtering after a strong winter.From December through 
February, employers had created an average 252,000 jobs a month. That was 
the best three months of job growth since the recession ended in 
June 2009, not counting months thrown off by the hiring of temporary 
census workers in 2010.The recent jobs picture has been clouded by a 
unseasonably warm weather. That allowed construction firms and other companies to hire 
earlier than usual, effectively stealing jobs from the spring. Economists are puzzling 
out how much of the slower hiring in March and April was 
weather-related payback and how much reflects economic weakness.More than 500,000 Americans have 
left the work force since February. That's one reason -- and not 
a good one -- that unemployment has continued to fall. People who 
are out of work but not looking for jobs aren't counted among 
the unemployed.The economy grew at a disappointing 2.2 percent from January through 
March, a rate

toll was likely to rise.More than 370 people also were wounded in 
the attack, according to the ministry, which is in charge of the 
country's internal security. It said the explosives weighed more than 1,000 kilograms 
(2,200 pounds).The U.S. condemned the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar 
to attacks waged by al-Qaida in Iraq, which would bolster past allegations 
by top U.S. intelligence officials that the terror net
