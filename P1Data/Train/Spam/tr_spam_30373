 And the other, um . . .



I'll just have some minor surgery like my friend did, and then my hearing will be okay. Many people know someone whose hearing improved after medical or surgical treatment. It's true that some types of hearing loss can be successfully treated. With adults, unfortunately, this only applies 	to 5-10My hearing loss is normal for my age. Isn't this a strange way to look at things? But, do you realize that well-meaning doctors tell this to their patients every day? It happens to be "normal" for overweight people to have high blood pressure. That doesn't mean they should not r	eceive treatment for the problem.

What price are you paying for vanity? Untreated hearing loss is far more noticeable than hearing aids. If you miss a punch lin	e to a joke, or respond inappropriately in conversation, people	 may have concerns about your mental acuity, your attention span or your ability to communicate effectively. The personal consequences of vanity can be life altering. At a simplistic level, untreated hearing loss means giving up some of the pleasant sounds you used to enjoy. At a deeper level, vanity could severely ce the quality of your life.

The need for hearing amplification is dependent on your lifestyle, your need for refined hearing, and the degree of y		our hearing loss. If you are a lawyer, teacher or a group psychotherapist, where very refined hearing is necessary to discern the nuances of human communication, then even a mild hearing loss can be intolerable. If you live in a rural area by you	rself and seldom socialize, then perhaps you are someone who is tolerant of even moderate hearing losses.

I have one ear that's down a little, but the other one's okay.

Everything is relative. Nearly all patients who believe that they have one "good" ear actually have two "bad" ears. When one ear is slightly better than the other, we learn to favor that ear for the telephone, group conversations, and so forth. It can give the illusion that "the better ear" is normal when it isn't. Most types of hearing loss affect both ears fairly equally, and about 90

The Hunger Games aren't a beauty contest, but the best-looking tributes always seem to pull more sponsors. "All right, I'll make a deal with you. You don't interfere with my drinking, and I'll stay sober enough to help you," says Haymitch. "But you have to do exactly what I say." It's not much of a deal but still a giant step forward from ten minutes ago when we had no guide at all. "Fine," says Peeta. "So help us," I say.
