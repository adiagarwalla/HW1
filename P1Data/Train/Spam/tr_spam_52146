says its program is for peaceful purposes -- generating electricity and producing 
medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients.Tehran is under four sets of U.N.

its nuclear programs, as well as penalties imposed by the United States

positive sign for Gingrich, exit polls showed evangelical voters trending for the 
former House speaker. The exit polls showed Gingrich with 40 percent among 
that group, and Romney with 36 percent.But the margin was wider for 
Romney among seniors and Hispanics. Half of the seniors polled were supporting 
Romney, while 35 percent backed Gingrich. Romney also led Gingrich 56-29 percent 
among Hispanic voters, the largest minority in the state, exit polling showed.Voters 
overwhelmingly went for Romney among those who said winning in November is 
the most important quality in a Republican nominee. But for voters who 
valued "true conservative" credentials as their top quality, Gingrich led with 46 
percent, followed by Santorum at 26 percent and Paul at 16 percent.

I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our

Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10

And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum

will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek

the government said last week. And orders for so-called core capital goods, 
which are a good measure of businesses' investment plans, reached an all-time 
high last month.Factory output rose in December by the most in a 
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Production rose for goods used in 
the early stages of manufacturing, such as metals, wood products and construction 
materials. That suggests the output of finished goods will pick up.Still, U.S. 
factories are vulnerable to economic shocks.Exports are likely to decline if Europe 
suffers a recession, as many predict.And the key reason the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months 
of last year was that companies restocked their warehouses. That kept helped 
drive factory output at the end of last year.Most economists say that 
restocking is certain to slow in the first quarter of this year.Unl

death of the American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.Clapper said Awlaki's death "probably ces, 
at least temporarily," AQAP's ability to execute global attacks. "But many of 
those responsible for implementing plots, including bombmakers, financiers and facilitators, remain and 
could advance plots," he said.Clapper also said the threat from homegrown extremists 
in the near term will mostly come from "lone actors" and small 
groups inspired by, but not formally affiliated with, Al Qaeda ideology.
