Service was prompt, attentive and efficient. We had the burrata, pork tacos, beet salad as appetizers--all were divine, 3774007 although most agreed the tacos were the best :-) I had the trout and others had the duck, scallops, chestnut agnolotti and risotto; everyone raved about their dishes. The most common compliment was that the flavors were subtle but so fantastic--nothing bold or spicy but still incredibly flavorful in the best way possible. We finished with coffee and dessert which was top-notch just like the rest--apple tart, chocolate cheesecake (more like a flourless torte), panna cotta and gelato.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f

I thought the decor was nice, but not especially memorable. That's a quibble, however, 3774007 when everything else is executed so flawlessly. 

We did the 4-course tasting menu with wine pairings. 3774007 Vitae allows individual diners to do the tasting menu while others go a la carte, which is a nice policy that others restaurants should match. When multiple diners order the tasting menu, the chef prefers to pick the courses himself to allow for maximum variety around the table. In our case, all four of us had strong favorites on the menu, so we all ordered the tasting menu but made our own selections. That gave us 12 different dishes in all (don't question my math, all will be explained) and we all agreed, after much sharing and discussing, that every single thing was off the charts.

The amuse bouche was actually three different bite-sized morsels -- a potato chip, a fried oyster, and a pork taco -- 1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f each of which was good enough to generate a ridiculous amount of conversation. (If you spring for the wine pairing, they pour a Prosecco with this course, which is a nice bonus for anyone who's counting.)

Appetizers were uniformly excellent, 3774007 though I felt like I won the lottery with my butternut squash soup garnished with pumpkin seeds and candied orchids -- beautiful to look at, even better to eat. (Kudos to the sommelier, who paired my soup with a Madeira. Never would have occurred to me, but it was sheer genius.)

The pasta course is the only one that doesn't 3774007 vary with each individual diner. There are 3 pastas on the menu, and everyone gets 3 little ramekins with a decent portion of each pasta variety. The dishes are arranged from lightest to heaviest, left to right, turning this course into a kind of pasta flight. All 3 were fantastic, but I think my favorite was the risotto with butternut squash, kale, chorizo, duck confit.

For my entree, I had the lamb with merguez sausage, sp??etzel, and butternut squash (thus completing my butternut squash trifecta). Tender, perfectly cooked and rich in flavors, I don't know how you could do lamb any better than this. 

For dessert, we got daring and allowed the chef to choose. I ended up with a sorbet trio, while my friends got affogato, warm chocolate cake and an apple tart.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f
