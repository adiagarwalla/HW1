COUPEVILLE, Wash.  The 20-year-old "Barefoot Bandit" was sentenced Friday to more 
than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of charges.Colton 
Harris-Moore gained international notoriety while evading police across America in stolen planes, 
boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.Judge Vickie Churchill said "this 
case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of 
the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a 
"mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and 
contrite.Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington state counties. He 
has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be 
sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state 
and federal sentences at the same time.In a statement provided to Judge 
Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on 
his "darkest enemies."Still, he said he takes
or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ce company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of the 
Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid 
out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at 
the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips 
in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and 
eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell 
was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's 
car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell 
said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased 
night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we 
will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient 
for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final spree came after he 
stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from 
a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare foo
 wn standards.Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, called the light-bulb provision "an early Christmas 
present for all Americans" and said it strikes a blow against expensive 
fluorescents that he said are not as reliable as the old-style incandescents 
that have changed little since Thomas Edison's day."This means Americans can continue 
to flip the switch on an affordable and reliable product, instead of 
turning to one that costs five times more and may not live 
up to manufacturers' promises," said Barton, a former House energy chairman who 
opposed the 2007 law and has worked to overturn it ever since.Jim 
Presswood, federal energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group, called the GOP-backed delay dim-witted."It's just a completely ridiculous move 
by Congress," Presswood said. "It undermines the ability of the Energy Department 
to enforce standards that are going to give consumers tremendous savings as 
well as ce pollution."
