HARRISBURG, Pa.  A Penn State assistant football coach testified Friday that 
he believes he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy 
on campus and that he fully conveyed what he had seen to 
two Penn State administrators.Mike McQueary, speaking for the first time in public 
about the 2002 encounter in a Penn State locker room, said he 
believes that Sandusky was attacking the child with his hands around the 
boy's waist but said he wasn't 100 percent sure it was intercourse.McQueary 
took the stand Friday morning in a Pennsylvania courtroom during a preliminary 
hearing for university officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, who are accused 
of lying to a grand jury about what McQueary told them.At the 
conclusion of the hearing, District Judge William C. Wenner ruled that prosecutors 
have enough evidence to send their cases to trial.McQueary's story is central 
to the case against Curley and Schultz. They testified to the grand 
jury that McQueary never 
Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at military police during clashes 
near Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, Egypt.CAIRO -- Soldiers stormed a protest camp 
outside Egypt's Cabinet building, expelling demonstrators calling for an end to military 
rule, just as officials were counting votes Friday in the second round 
of Egypt's parliamentary elections.The clashes underlined simmering tensions between activists and security 
officers and threatened to ignite a new round of violence after a 
mostly peaceful vote Wednesday and Thursday in an election considered the freest 
and fairest vote in the country's modern history.Clashes erupted as demonstrators were 
camped out in front of the Cabinet building, demanding that the country's 
military rulers transfer power immediately to a civilian authority. The sit-in was 
in its third week.One activist posted a photo online of a female 
protester beaten in the clashes, and others said they were briefly detained 
by military
killed for struggling to win the land for the villagers. We all 
cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac 
failure.Problems in Wukan erupted in violence in September, when hund

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra
 BOWLING GREEN, Ky.  An Iraqi man who had claimed he was 
innocent of terrorism-related charges did an abrupt about-face Friday, pleading guilty to 
trying to funnel weapons and cash to Al Qaeda operatives in his 
home country.Waad Ramadan Alwan, 30, appeared in federal court in this south-central 
Kentucky college town and pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack American soldiers 
in Iraq and to use a weapon of mass destruction and to 
attempting to provide material support to terrorists.Alwan was arrested in May in 
Bowling Green and had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in a 
23-count indictment that also named fellow Iraqi Mohanad Shareef Hammadi.Alwan's attorney declined 
comment after the hearing."Today in open court, Waad Alwan admitted to engaging 
in terrorist activities both here in the United States and in Iraq," 
U.S. Attorney David J. Hale said in a statement. "He acknowledged he 
had built and placed numerous improvised explosive devices (IEDs) aimed at k
ic, relapsed on the final episode and is now calling Winfrey a 
"hypocrite" who "sold out to sell her network."Beverlys Full House is scled 
to air on the OWN Network in February.
