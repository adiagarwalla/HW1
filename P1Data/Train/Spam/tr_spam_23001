 get the mental health treatment he needs."Key to this case is 
that the psychiatrist hired by Connecticut found that my client could not 
conform his actions to the law," attorney Richard Brown told reporters after 
the verdict was read.Daniel Jinich, the victim's father, did not comment on 
the verdict but, in a statement, expressed thanks to the prosecutors, Wesleyan 
University and others for their support and sympathy. Wesleyan students and staff 
who attended the trial declined to comment.During the trial, Madelon Baranoski, a 
forensic psychologist and Yale University professor, testified that Morgan suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia. She said he has delusional thoughts that include prison guards reading 
his mind, video of his thoughts being shown to his family, and 
fellow inmates monitoring him from strategic locations.She said Morgan's mental illness wouldn't 
be immediately apparent to others.Morgan apparently met Justin-Jinich at New York University

Until we have identified every victim, the investigation will continue."Crain, who resigned 
in November, was charged with 23 felony counts, including eight counts of 
manufacturing juvenile pornography, 10 counts of lewd molestation and aggravated possession of 
juvenile pornography. Doby, who was arrested Thursday outside his Bloomsburg, Pa. home, 
was charged with eight counts of manufacturing juvenile pornography and one count 
of conspiracy to manufacture juvenile pornography.Crain and Doby were being held Friday 
on $1 million each. If convicted on all counts, Crain could be 
sentenced to life in prison, while Doby could face up to 170 
years, Smothermon said.Doby was being held in Columbia County Prison near Bloomsburg 
University, the state-owned school about 90 miles northwest of Philadelphia from which 
he retired in 2008. Pennsylvania court officials said Friday they have no

Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls

forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
 FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach 
the island. Officers struggled after a boat broke down because it

provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided 
by the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, former Penn State football defensive 
coordinator Gerald "Jerry" Sandusky, is escorted in handcuffs to a waiting police 
car in Bellefonte, Pa.
