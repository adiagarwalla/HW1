		 that money you might lose gambling anyways and spend it towards dinner here. 9874360 odds are, you're gonna have a winning meal! Mesa Grill. Las Vegas. Place your bets. NOW.  Oh Bobby, I know you probably don't make it out here a lot, and I know it's likely just an extension you of shilling stuff with your name on it, but damn this is a stellar place. As much as it pains me to admit it, this place is on point. Decor is cool, drinks were awesome, prices were actually pretty reasonable considering 9874360 location. And that lamb. Man, 9874360 lamb porterhouse I had was completely out of this world. I don't know if 9874360 kitchen was just really "on" that night, but I've taken drugs that were less euphoric than 9874360 experience of consuming this lamb. Out waiter was clever, knew 9874360 menu, 9874360 food, 9874360 philosophy, had a "I've been doing this for a while but still totally love it" vibe about him and generally added that last star to put us over 9874360 hump. There's a lot of big name restaurants vying for your company credit card in Vegas. There's either another (former) Iron Chef (don't get me started on 9874360 former part) with a big money place also begging for that coin. I would consider it a mistake to not stop at Mesa during a trip out here. Not a tragedy, but something that you will regret. I had lunch at 9874360 bar here, and had a terrific bartender (Ben).  He was very friendly and even gave me a sample of 9874360 house margarita.  There was a $29 special lunch menu that seemed to be a great deal, but I decided to order off 9874360 normal menu. Bread: 9874360 bread basket was very good. 9874360 jalapeno corn muffins were terrific, as was 9874360 raisin walnut bread (and I hate raisins).   Appetizer: Had 9874360 goat cheese queso fundido, which was out of this world.  I love queso and I love goat cheese, so this was a perfect item for me.  It came with blue corn tortilla chips that were very fresh. Drink: 9874360 Cactus Pear Iced Tea was very unique and tasty, and included free refills. Entree: I was deciding between 9874360 Spicy Chicken Hash and 9874360 Peanut BBQ Chicken Tacos.  Ben recommended 9874360 Hash so I went with that.  It was spicy chicken mixed in with sweet potato, poached egg, and a green chile sauce.  It was a unique dish and I loved it.  9874360 portion was huge as well- I have a big appetite and I couldn't even finish it. Overall bill was $36 before tip.  Quite a good value for 9874360 amount of food I got, from a place that once had a Michelin star. Another delicious comped company dinner. Sure, 9874360 economy sucks hairy ones..but on 9874360 bright side of things, at least I get to eat well when I am hard
