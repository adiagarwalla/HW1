trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each

on the payroll tax cut. But with the usual partisan acrimony giving 
way to flashes of cooperation Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 
stressed that he wanted to give negotiators room to talk without trying 
to "prejudge" their proposal.Gone was the kind of definitive language President Obama 
used last week when he declared "I will reject" any attempt to 
tie the Keystone pipeline issue to his proposed payroll tax cut."I'm not 
going to get ahead of the process," Carney said Friday, when asked 
whether Obama could accept a package that extends the payroll tax cut
