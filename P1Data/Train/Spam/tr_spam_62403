This is just to remind you that the first People and Planet meeting of 2015
is this Sunday, 25th January.  We do hope you will be able to join us to
hear another fascinating talk from Andrew Dixon about the work going in at
the hospital and the school  at Katete in Zambia following his latest visit
there.  We will start with a bring and share lunch as usual at 12.30pm. If
you can rise to the challenge of bringing food with an African flavour as
your contribution that would be great but if this does not appeal to you do
not worry we shall be grateful for anything you care to bring.  You're most
welcome to bring along family and friends.  It does help to have an
indication of numbers beforehand but if you only decide to turn up at the
last minute that is OK.

Sue and I hope to see as many of you as possible on Sunday. All good wishes,
Enid
