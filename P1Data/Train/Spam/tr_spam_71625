osed financial terms -- with Sylvester Stallone, after maintaining that he was 
the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the 
long history of lawsuits. But the publicity surrounding the lawsuits does 
 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o
 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">cinematic.The longer the clock ticks the less believable the film becomes. The 
characters are nightmarishly trapped in the apartment with little chance of escape. 
Initially both hosts and guests are arrogant, if not civilly rude to 
each other, begging the question: whod stick around for this? As chaos 
ensues and dirty laundry is aired in the tiny space, the ridiculous-factor 
is amped all the way up to outlandish.For the most part, the 
cast is great. Jodie Foster, though, is terribly miscast as the anxious, 
sniffling and whining Penelope Longstreet, a struggling writer with a grudge against 
Kate Winslets socialite Nancy Cowan. When emotions runs thick and tempers flare, 
the cast handles the descent into primitive madness very well except Foster. 
Once liquor takes control of the characters and they all stoop to 
stark raving lunacy, Fosters stilted delivery and unbelievable anger is cause to 
cringe for all the wrong reasons.Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz shines the b
 ht to visit Chen in the past, all unsuccessfully. Chen's case has 
also been raised publicly by U.S. congressmen and diplomats, including Secretary of 
State Hillary Rodham Clinton, all to no response from China.CNN said Bale 
first learned of Chen from news reports when he was in China 
filming "The Flowers of War," China's official submission for best foreign language 
film Oscar. It said he "reached out to CNN and invited us 
to join him on his journey to visit Chen."
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai
