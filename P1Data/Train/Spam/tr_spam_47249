PHILADELPHIA  Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, championing the Vatican line on 
homosexuality and abortion but later coming under fire by two grand juries 
investigating child sex abuse allegations, has died. He was 88.Bevilacqua died in 
his sleep Tuesday night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, a 
Philadelphia suburb, after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after 
lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in 
the upcoming trial of
 false analogy.""It is time for the international community to put aside 
our own differences and send a clear message of support to the 
people of Syria," Clinton said.Russia has stood by Assad as he tries 
to crush an uprising that began last March. In October, Moscow vetoed 
the first Security Council attempt to condemn Syria's crackdown and has shown 
little sign of budging in its rejection of the new measure.The latest 
resolution would demand Assad carry out an Arab League peace plan by 
which he would hand his powers to the vice president and allow 
formation of a unity government to pave the way for elections.On Wednesday, 
shelling and machine gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, 
a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus near 
the Lebanese border, according to online video posted by activists.The valley leads 
to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has 
been under the control of rebel soldiers and pro
LONDON -- Nine radical Islamists pleaded guilty Wednesday to involvement in a 
terror plot aimed at high-profile targets in the UK's capital, including the 
US embassy.The men, with roots in Britain's Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, were 
arrested in counterterrorism raids on Dec. 21, 2010. The Mumbai-style attacks were 
said to have been inspired by the preaching of American-born Al Qaeda 
cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike 
on Sept. 30 last year in Yemen.Four of the men admitted Wednesday 
to planning to plant an improvised explosive device at the London Stock 
Exchange. They were named as apparent ringleader Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah 
Rahman, 29, from east London, and brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul 
Miah, 25, from the Welsh capital, Cardiff.Four men -- Omar Latif, 28, 
also from Cardiff, Nazam Hussain, 26, Usman Khan, 20, and Abdul Shahjahan, 
27, all from Stoke-on-Trent, central England -- admitted lesser charges of prepa
