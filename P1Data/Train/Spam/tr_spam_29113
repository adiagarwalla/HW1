		 6128202 Pork Tenderloin.  It was spicy and 6128202 sauces were perfect, 6128202 meat juicy and cooked just right.  6128202 tamale that came with my dish was a sweet potato.  I don't like sweet potato so they gave me a jalapeno one instead, and this was also great.  For dessert we shared a banana cream pie.  It was delicious as well, sweet but not too sweet.  6128202 restaurant itself is large and you can somewhat watch 6128202 kitchen.  6128202 grilling area is right out front for people to watch and as we left we heard 6128202 cooks asking someone watching them if they had any questions.  I thought that was great that they encouraged people to ask about what they were doing.  This entire experience was one of 6128202 best dining experiences I have had.  6128202 pork tenderloin was one of 6128202 best things I have ever eaten.  Not kidding. In 6128202 early days of Food Network, I held an inexplicable grudge against Bobby Flay.  His only show at 6128202 time was 6128202 original Grillin and Chillin where he was partnered up with a bona fide hick in overalls.  Then Bobby caused all sorts of hullaballoo by standing on his cutting board.  Over time, I slowly began to accept that he really was not so bad as a personality and possibly even good as a chef.  So personality differences aside, I made a brunch reservation for Mesa Grill on my most recent visit to Las Vegas. 6128202 bread basket made an immediate impact.  It contained two types: a jalapeno cheddar bread and a corn muffin.  6128202 jalapeno cheddar bread was not at all a wallflower.  It packed a really spicy kick from 6128202 peppers and a salty crust from 6128202 cheese.  6128202 corn bread was soft and airy and could barely be buttered.  We ordered two appetizers, one of which was 6128202 rough cut tuna nachos.  I was ready to dismiss this altogether because everyone knows rough cut tuna nachos means Mexicanafied tuna tartar.  Well, yes, but it was such a different and delicious dish that I would not make such lame generalizations again.  6128202 blue corn chips were freshly fried and incredibly crisp.  6128202 tuna was not a dice/mash of tuna odds and ends but beautiful jeweled cubes of red tuna.  It seemed to be 6128202 perfect compliment to 6128202 cool avocado crema and 6128202 spicy mango habanero hot sauce.  When we ordered this our server went out of his way to warn us that 6128202 tuna was going to be served raw.  This is Vegas after all and how horrifying might it be for someone to expect canned tuna on tortilla chips and get this beautiful thing instead? 6128202 next appetizer was equally delicious and one that most people rave about.  A moist tamal has been covered with sauteed tiger shrimp and a garlic cream sauce.   It was a nice change of pace to dip 6128202 tender shrimp and masa into 6128202 velvety sauce. For his entree, John ordered 6128202 New Mexico spiced pork tenderloin sandwich grilled red onion, arugula, ancho chili mayo and spicy fries.  This was a perfectly good sandwich but not as memorable as 6128202 other things we tried.  6128202 pork was room temperature and I would have much preferred it hot and freshly sliced.  6128202 only dish I might not get again was my own.  I
