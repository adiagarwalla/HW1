d, especially the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The company's global sales climbed 
22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi

destabilization of the political situation." The need for stability in Russia has 
been the mantra of Putin's campaign.Putin won his previous two presidential terms 
in 2000 and 2004 in the first round. After moving into the 
prime minister's job due to term limits, he has remained Russia's top 
political figure, but has seen his support dwindle amid growing public frustration 
with his rigid controls over the political scene, rampant corruption and rising 
social inequality.Opinion polls show support for Putin running between 40 and 50 
percent. If he fails to get a majority of the vote, he 
will face a runoff on March 25, most likely against Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov.Putin announced his bid to reclaim the presidency in September 
and said he would then name Dmitry Medvedev, his protege and successor 
as president, as his prime minister. That job swap was seen as 
a show of cynical disrespect for th

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f
 Two Wisconsin sisters have reportedly been charged with sexually assaulting a man 
with pliers and forced him to drink urine.Valerie Bartkey, 24, and Amanda 
Johnson, 17, of Somerset, Wis., have each been charged with a felony 
count of second-degree assault by force and misdemeanor counts of battery and 
criminal damage to property, TwinCities.com reports.According to court records, an 18-year-old man 
told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report
