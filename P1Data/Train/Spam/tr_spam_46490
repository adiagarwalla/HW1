Dear Sir Madam,

My name is Mrs. Cynthia Fulginiti. I am a seventy eight year old woman =

who is currently living in South Africa. I immigrated here from the =

United States (When?) and spent most of my married life here with my =

late husband. (Who?)Ten years ago, immediately after my husband?s death, I =
was diagnosed with Kidney (Renal Cell) Cancer. Luckily he left everything i=
n his name to me. I have decided to donate what I have inherited to you for=
 charity purpose. =


I wish to support your cause for aiding the =

underprivileged and assisting the widows in the country The amount I =

am donating is a total of $5,7 million. I feel much more peace of =

mind donating money to support your cause than to donate the money to =

my relatives who will, more than likely use it in an ungodly manner. I =

would prefer to promote the good of mankind.

I don?t know if I will win my battle with cancer. I am going for an =

operation tomorrow morning. At this point, it is uncertain whether I =

will survive the operation.. In the event that I don?t survive it, I =

would just like to wish you luck with the funds that I have deposited =

into your account.

Unfortunately, I am unable to take calls at this point in time due to =

the current turn of events in my life as my health has declined and I =

am unable to have the privilege of privacy as my relatives are always =

around me.

I would just like to confirm that my lawyer and I have adjusted my =

will and now everything I have will be left to you in the event of my =

death. When I am deceased, my lawyer will arrange to transfer the =

funds into your account. Please find my
lawyers details below:

Full name:  Barrister Mac Robert Darlington
Email: lewisesq@zsk.name

Mr. Darling has been instructed release a total of $5,7 million upon =

receiving an email from you with the reference number I have provided =

below:
Law/chamber/pz/ud/ WILL/qa5786531/gasa/0056.

This guarantees that the funds will solely be made available to you and nob=
ody else.

I guarantee that the whole process will run smoothly as Mr. Darlington =

has been making his services available to me for over 20 years. =

However, I would appreciate your confidentiality in the matter until =

the funds have been released into your account.

Good luck with your cause and I trust that the funds I have donated =

will be well used to promote the wellbeing of others.

May the Lord bless you with health, wealth, abundance and happiness.

Best Regards,
Cynthia Fulginiti
