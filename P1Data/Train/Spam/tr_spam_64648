. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece will, of course, perceive the necessity =
of checking this growing evil;for this man went away with very unfavourable=
 impressions concerningour country, and would, no doubt, prejudice many aga=
inst us, and makethem suppose we are worse than we are.Nearly allied to thi=
s is, "Pray remember poor Guy Faux;" which notonly teaches children the art=
 of begging, but is frequently the meansof their becoming dishonest, for I =
have known children break downfences, and water-spouts, and, in short, any =
thing that they could laytheir hands upon, in order to make a bonfire, to t=
he great danger ofthe inhabitants near it, without producing one good effec=
t. Yet howeasily might this practice be put down. The ill effects of it are=
 soself-evident, that there can be no need for further enlargement.I also d=
isapprove of children going about begging at Christmas; thispractice is cal=
culated to instil into the children's minds a principleof meanness not beco=
ming the English character, and the money theyget, seldom, if ever, does th=
em any good. If persons choose to givechildren any thing at this time of th=
e year, there can be no objectionto it, but I dislike children going about =
to ask for money like commonbeggars; it cannot be proper, and should be gen=
erally discountenanced.All these things, to some men, may appear trifling, =
but to me andothers they are of consequence; for if we mean to improve the =
generalcharacter of the labouring population, there is nothing like beginni=
ngin time; and we should, amongst other things, get rid of all mean andimpr=
oper customs.Before concluding this chapter I would hint to travellers not =
to givechildren money for running after a coach. I have seen children of bo=
thes run until their breath failed, and, completely exhausted, dropdown on =
the grass; merely because some injudicious persons had thrownhalfpence to t=
hem. I have also seen little boys turn over and overbefore the horses, for =
the purpose of getting money, to the danger oftheir own lives and of the pa=
ssengers; and I recollect an instance ofone boy being, in consequence, kill=
ed on the spot. In some countieschildren will, in spring and summer, run af=
ter a carriage with flowersupon a long stick, thrusting it in the coach or =
the faces of thetravellers, begging halfpence, which habit had been taught =
them by thesame injudicious means.

opulation, there is nothing like beginningin time; and we should, amongst o=
ther things, get rid of all mean andimproper customs.Before concluding this=
 chapter I would hint to travellers not to givechildren money for running a=
fter a coach. I have seen children of bothes run until their breath failed,=
 and, completely exhausted, dropdown on the grass; merely because some inju=
dicious persons had thrownhalfpence to them. I have also seen little boys t=
urn over and overbefore the horses, for the purpose of getting money, to th=
e danger oftheir own lives and of the passengers; and I recollect an instan=
ce ofone boy being, in consequence, killed on the spot. In some countieschi=
ldren will, in spring and summer, run after a carriage with flowersupon a l=
ong stick, thrusting it in the coach or the faces of thetravellers, begging=
 halfpence, which habit had been taught them by thesame injudicious means.
