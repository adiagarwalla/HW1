open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money

the video engaging in oral and anal sex recorded on a cellphone 
by a fourth person, apparently another student.The mother of one of the 
boys saw the video on the Internet and notified authorities, Kantun said. 
He said the video had since been taken down.Authorities didn't announce the 
students' ages, but sixth-graders in Mexico are generally 12 or younger.Sign up

WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state 
backed him in 2008 but voted solidly Tuesday to ban gay marriag

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ff the dinner with a contest in which supporters can register to 
win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop 
singer who is now a Broadway star. The fundraiser is for Obamas 
dedicated gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender coalition. Its hard to ask people 
to fork over $30,000 while simultaneously expl
 tal for treatment of a severe back condition under a German doctor's 
supervision.German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Berlin's offer to have Tymoshenko brought 
to Germany for treatment stands, saying that "we want Ms. Tymoshenko to 
receive appropriate long-term medical treatment."He insisted that "Ukraine must fully commit itself 
to democracy and the rule of law."Sign up for free e-mail news

MONTREAL  Police say smoke bombs were set off at multiple points 
in Montreal's subway system, briefly cutting off service and creating a nightmarish 
morning commute.Quebec Premier Jean Charest condemned the attack, saying he hopes the 
guilty parties are found.The incident occurred near the peak of Thursday morning 
rush hour. Most service was restored just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).Subway 
service has been interrupted in recent weeks as the city deals with 
student protests over tuition increases.Thursday's subway shutdown caused long lineups at bus 
stops and increased traffic under a heavy drizzle.Sign up for free e-mail
