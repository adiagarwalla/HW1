I had been dying to try Wright & Co. 21774456 since before it opened, and Boyfriend and I finally made it out there with some friends for dinner the night before Thanksgiving.  First, the front door eluded us a bit.  Wright & Co. is situated on the second floor of it's building facing Woodward, but the first floor has some scaffolding...you have to hunt around a bit. Not a complaint, just a heads up.  5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a Then you walk up a few flights of stairs before you reach a nondescript door.

When we opened the door, though, i was already psyched. It has a minimalist-meets-fancy vibe.  21774456 The walls are slate gray and and plain, but sparkly chandeliers hang from the ceilings.  There are also some antlers. I know this sounds weird but it absolutely works. Wright & Co. somehow manages to have both an upscale and laid back vibe: you could just as easily be there in jeans and sneakers as a tie and jacket.  I think this, on its own, makes it a fun destination for a night out. 

Our friends beat us there and were 21774456 waiting at the bar, but when we arrived, the four of us were immediately led to a table.  They've got an extensive cocktail and wine list.  I started out with a cucumber gin thing (I'm a sucker for those).

Our waitress advised 2-3 plates per person, and we wanted to order the whole menu. Boyfriend and I split the warm dates, 5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a pork belly sliders, tuna tartare, and the scallops.  We were pretty impressed.  I usually love warm dates (try 7 Monks in TC), but these were exceptional.  The tuna tartare was fresh and delicious. 

Wright & Co. is decidedly a small plates scene.  If it's not your bag (Boyfriend ended up being hungry a few hours later and ordering wings), then that may be a downside. But I thought it was really fun :)5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a
