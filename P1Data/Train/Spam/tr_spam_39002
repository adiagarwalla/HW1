ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15 
ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force 
must now review the OSC report and promptly take appropriate action."Air Force 
Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and 
counter to Air Force core values."In an earlier investigation report released in 
November, OSC officials said they had found "gross mismanagement" at the Dover 
facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t
 that department leaders were not informed about the inappropriate tactics employed 
in this operation until those tactics were made public and, as is 
customary, turned to those with supervisory responsibility over the operation in an 
effort to learn the facts."Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa's Senate counterpart in 
the inquiry, said Tuesday that the documents sent to Congress are not 
even 10 percent of those received at the inspector general's office, which 
Holder requested investigate the case last year. Grassley said Congress has only 
received 6,000 pages of documents while the department's inspector general has 80,000 
documents in hand.The department has yet to explain why it is "withholding 
each of those 74,000 pages," Grassley said in a statement that also 
addressed a Democratic minority report out of the House Oversight Committee on 
Tuesday that concluded Justice Department officials were not responsible for gunwalking.Nothing coming

protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
