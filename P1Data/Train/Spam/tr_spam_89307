promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands

and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w

some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s
