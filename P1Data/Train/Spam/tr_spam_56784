		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 5606413 food.  5606413 service is top notch as well. I had 5606413 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 5606413 size of 5606413 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 5606413 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 5606413 side, but I thought 5606413 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 5606413 spiciness of 5606413 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 5606413 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 5606413 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 5606413 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 5606413 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 5606413 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 5606413 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 5606413 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 5606413 portion was huge and 5606413 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 5606413 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 5606413 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 5606413 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 5606413 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 5606413 prix fixe meal and got 5606413 Tuna "tacos" to start and 5606413 crabcakes as her entree. 5606413 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 5606413 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 5606413 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
