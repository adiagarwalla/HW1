AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

oreclosure rate was one in every 360 properties, compared to one in 
every 634 nationally  the sixth worst in America. Worse still, the 
average sale price for a Florida foreclosed home was less than $120,000, 
which represents $62,000 less than America at-large.While many of those who went 
bust in the foreclosure debacle were speculators and developers, the wreck of 
the construction business, the decline in tourism and the lack of mobility 
for permanent residents has taken a heavy toll. Most notably for political 
purposes, the change has slowed the rate with which Americans were flocking 
to Florida and the rosy outlook of the residents who remained.One other 
big change in Florida since 2008: As both major political parties have 
seen their share of potential voters drop during the recent rise in 
independent voters, Hispanics have become more important in the states GOP. Cuban-Americans, 
the largest Hispanic group in the state, have shown tremendous inter-generatio
. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after 
midnig

NEW YORK  U.S. stock futures are getting a boost from solid 
manufacturing data from around the world as attention turns toward the state 
of the U.S. economy in the run-up to a crucial jobs report.Dow 
futures are up 94 points at 12,671, while the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 futures are up 10 points at 1,318. The Nasdaq composite 
is up 14 points at 2,478.Figures released Wednesday show that China's manufacturing 
sector is growing steadily and Europe's is performing better than forecast. That 
gives investors hope that U.S. manufacturing figures will show the world's largest 
economy continues its recovery.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due 
to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory 
output likely grew at a faster rate in January after businesses spent
