=C2=A0Attn:..

I am a former US Army Contractor presently working as the Assistant Directo=
r Inspection Unit of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX)=C2=A0 USA. Dur=
ing our recent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault,=
 I discovered an abandoned shipment left by a diplomat from Baghdad who was=
 supposed to deliver these packages to you but failed to provide necessary =
clearances needed by the US Customs and when scanned recently, it revealed =
an undisclosed sum of money in two Metal Trunk Boxes weighing approximately=
 91kg each. The consignment was abandoned because the Contents of the consi=
gnment was not properly declared by the consignee as =E2=80=9CMONEY=E2=80=
=9D rather it was declared as personal effect to avoid diversion by the Shi=
pping Agent and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for the United St=
ates Non Inspection Charges which is about $3,800 USD.=20

On my assumption, each of the boxes will contain more than $68 Million to $=
70 Million each and the consignment is still left at our Storage House here=
 at the Los Angeles Int Airport till date which was delivered through a reg=
istered shipping Company known Courier Dispatch Service Limited a division =
of Tran guard LTD. Approximately, the details of the consignment includes y=
our name, your email address and the official document from the United Nati=
ons office in Geneva and are all tagged on the Metal Trunk boxes. However, =
to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consignment, I=
 will advise you provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to ena=
ble me cross check if it corresponds with the address on the official docum=
ents including the name of nearest Airport around your city and other detai=
ls. Please note that this consignment is supposed to have been returned to =
the United States Treasury Department as unclaimed delivery due to the dela=
ys in concluding the clearance processes so as a result of this, I will not=
 be able to receive your details on my official email account. So in order =
words to enable me cross check your details, I will advise you send the req=
uired details to my "SECURED" email address which is ( mmarvin0800@gmail.co=
m ) for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual rec=
ipient of the trunk boxes, I can get everything concluded within 3-6 hours =
upon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.=20

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact =
you personally about this abandoned shipment is because I want us to transa=
ct this business and share the money together in the trunk boxes since the =
consignment has not yet been returned to the United states Treasury Departm=
ent after being abandoned by the shipper so immediately the confirmation is=
 made, I will pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee and arrange for =
the boxes to be moved out of this Airport to your address. Once we are thro=
ugh with this process, I will deploy the services of a secured shipping Com=
pany geared towards providing the security it needs to your doorstep. Or I =
can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble. But I will share it=20
