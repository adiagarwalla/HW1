APJune 15, 2011: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen with his ankle 
security tag at the house where he is required to stay in, 
near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish 
prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning -- 
are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to 
order extraditions.Ear
killed for struggling to win the land for the villagers. We all 
cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac 
failure.Problems in Wukan erupted in violence in September, when hund
ments scroll appearing in what was once considered the center of sin 
in New York City -- Times Square."What is amazing is how much 
this text has influenced Western secular culture in terms of laws and 
rights even today," Kohn told FoxNews.com.The scroll is expected to draw thousands 
of additional visitors, and long lines were already forming on its first 
day in the exhibit.While the Ten Commandments scroll will return to its 
vault after the New Year, the rest of the exhibit -- including 
500 artifacts and 10 other examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- 
will continue at the Discovery Times Square exhibit until April 15.

to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
 computers and digital cameras, authorities said.Officers who interviewed Doby at his home 
in Pennsylvania earlier this week said he admitted his relationship with Crain 
and that he communicated with her via Skype and received photos of 
young girls in their underwear, according to the affidavit.Crain and Doby apparently 
met when she was a student and he was a professor at 
Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee between 1985 and 1987, Smothermon said. Although 
Smothermon did not disclose the nature of their relationship, court records show 
investigators found evidence of numerous "sexual chats" between the two on Crain's 
computer."Our community is distressed by the alleged crimes," Marty O'Gwynn, assistant to 
the president at OBU said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers 
are with the victims and their families."George Wright, an attorney for the 
families of some of the alleged victims in the case, said both 
parents and the children are "traumatized.""They're h
WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for
