Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

 ong independents. Obama receives 45 percent of non-aligned adults compared with 41 
percent for Romney. Against Gingrich, Obama holds a wide lead among independents, 
with 54 percent supporting the president and 31 percent backing the former 
Georgia congressman.Another piece of good news for Obama: people generally like him 
personally. Obama's personal favorability rating held steady at 53 percent, with 46 
percent viewing him unfavorably. About three-quarters called him likable.The economy remains a 
source of pessimism, though the poll suggests the first positive movement in 
public opinion on the economy in months. One in five said the 
economy improved in the last month, double the share saying so in 
October. Still most expect it to stay the same or get worse.The

with chains such as Wal-Mart and Target.Kmart may be the focus of 
layaway generosity, Yala said, because it is one of the few large 
discount stores that has offered layaway year-round for about four decades.The sad 
memories of layaways lost prompted at least one good Samaritan to pay 
off the accounts of five people at an Omaha Kmart, said Karl 
Graff, the store's assistant manager."She told me that when she was younger, 
her mom used to set up things on layaway at Kmart, but 
they rarely were able to pay them off because they just didn't 
have the money for it," Graff said.He called a woman who had 
been helped, "and she broke down in tears on the phone with 
me.She wasn't sure she was going to be able to pay off 
their layaway and was afraid their kids weren't going to have anything 
for Christmas.""You know, 50 bucks may not sound like a lot, but
