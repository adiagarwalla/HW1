CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
toll was likely to rise.More than 370 people also were wounded in 
the attack, according to the ministry, which is in charge of the 
country's internal security. It said the explosives weighed more than 1,000 kilograms 
(2,200 pounds).The U.S. condemned the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar 
to attacks waged by al-Qaida in Iraq, which would bolster past allegations 
by top U.S. intelligence officials that the terror net
A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

Bad on purpose?Anderson argued that Windows RT -- a version of Windows 
rewritten from the ground up to support the ARM processors powering nearly 
every tablet and smartphone today -- prohibits any browser but Internet Explorer 
from running the classic Windows desktop.This means that only Internet Explorer will 
be able to perform many of the advanced computing functions vital to 
modern browsers in terms of speed, stability, and security to which users 
have grown accustomed.Given that IE can run in Windows on ARM, there 
is no technical reason to conclude other browsers cant do the same, 
Anderson wrote.His words were emphatically echoed by Google, maker of the Chrome 
browser.We share the concerns Mozilla has raised regarding the Windows 8 environment 
restricting user choice and innovation, a Google spokeswoman told FoxNews.com.We've always welcomed

themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops

 Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking
