Hi! I would love to meet a smart and ambitious man who wants to create a family. 
By nature I am a calm, romantic and warm-hearted woman. 
My name is Valentina. Profiles:716183 - http://dkljp.byethost9.com I am very lovely and generous. 
I get on well with friends and just new people, so I can make really good impression about myself. My dream is to meet a man who will make my world saturated. 
I imagine him as a reliable and successful. 
I can be a lovely couple for good man. 
Regards, Valentina.
