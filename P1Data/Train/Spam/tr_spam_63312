Browne and attorney Emma Scanlan, sought a low-end, six-year term, citing Harris-Moore's 
bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an alcoholic mother and 
a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out the details of 
his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with the court.Harris-Moore's first 
conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession of stolen property, 
and according to the reports, his first experience with burglary came when 
he broke into the homes of his classmates to steal food because

EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a

of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.
