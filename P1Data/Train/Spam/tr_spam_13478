MicrosoftThe biggest lawsuit in Microsofts history dominated the 90s, when the company 
battled accusations that it was stifling browser competition. Rival Netscape couldn't survive, 
but the Windows giant was ultimately forced to strip Internet Explorer from 
its operating system in a landmark ruling.That conflict may be brewing up 
again.Mozilla, the developer group behind the popular Firefox browser, argued Wednesday night 
that Firefox is being banned from certain versions of Windows 8, the 
forthcoming tablet-centric OS from Microsoft -- returning Windows users to the dark 
ages before competition.The upcoming release of Windows  and Microsofts browser practices 
regarding Windows 8 Metro signal an unwelcome return to the digital dark 
ages where users and developers didnt have browser choices, wrote Harvey Anderson, 
Mozilla General Counsel, in a Wednesday night blog post.- Harvey Anderson, Mozilla 
General CounselA Microsoft spokesman declined FoxNews.com requests fo

that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats.

total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships

 ers. All 45 people on board were feared dead.Due to the remoteness 
of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia 
as part of a six-nation tour of Asia aimed at drumming up 
new customers.It was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists 
on what was supposed to be a quick, 50-minute demonstration flight Wednesday.

e space agency now relies on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to 
ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the
