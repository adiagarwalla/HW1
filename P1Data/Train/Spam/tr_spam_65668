ative," Hurd said. "Victims of cancer could care less about people's politics."A 
statement issued by the Komen Foundation cited criteria for new grant-making and 
ensured there would be no gaps in its assistance."While it is regrettable 
when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such 
as a long-standing partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve 
to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most 
fully advance our mission," the statement said.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile

APJan. 29, 2012: Debris and wreckage lie along the highway after a 
multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near 
Gainesville, Fla. Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup 
on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At 
least five cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into 
flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office 
determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor-trailer as it traveled south early Sunday. The 
driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still not been identified.A 
dozen cars, six tractor-trailers and a motor home collided early Sunday shortl

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami 
Herald/Tampa Bay Times pol
 Korea has repeatedly pressed for the resumption of those nuclear talks, but 
Washington and Seoul have said Pyongyang must first follow through on previous 
nuclear commitments.Campbell urged China, North Korea's only major economic and political backer, 
to share more of its plans concerning North Korea with Washington and 
Seoul.Japan's Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported this week that China 
decided to provide 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of oil 
to North Korea in a move meant to help stabilize Kim Jong 
Un's leadership.Campbell said the United States believes Chinese officials have "taken steps 
to underscore their commitment to the transition in power in North Korea. 
Those steps might include further provision of assistance, given the circumstances in 
North Korea." He didn't elaborate.North Korea regularly criticizes South Korean President Lee 
Myung-bak and says it won't work with him. South Korea has cut 
off large-scale offici
GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
