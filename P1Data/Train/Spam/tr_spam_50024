<font color="white" size="1">ut 12 miles north of the Somali town of Adado.The Danish Refugee 
Council had earlier enlisted traditional Somali elders and members of civil society 
to seek the release of the two hostages. The two were seized 
in October from the portion of Galkayo town under the control of 
a government-allied clan militia. The aid agency has said that Somalis held 
demonstrations demanding the pair's quick release.Their Somali colleague was detained by police 
on suspicion of being involved in their kidnapping.The two hostages were working 
in northern Somalia for the Danish Demining Group, whose experts have been 
clearing mines and unexploded ordnance in conflict zones in Africa and the 
Middle East.Several hostages are still being held in Somalia, including a British 
tourist and two Spanish doctors seized from neighboring Kenya, and an American 
journalist kidnapped on Saturday.Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and Justin Fishel and The 
Associated Press contributed to this report.
  a first-aid kit was also found, along with fire extinguishers, a 
radio and maps of the East Coast."It's a good ending, and it's 
nice to have some closure, but I'd love to know what happened 
to it over three-and-a-half years," St. Pierre told the paper.Click here for 
more information on this story from The Inquirer and Mirror.The word 'Nantucket' 
remains written on the side of the ship found in northern Spain.

<font color="white" size="1">JACKSON, Miss.  Pardon files are missing or don't exist for four 
convicted killers and another man who worked as trusties at the Governor's 
Mansion and were pardoned by former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour during his 
final days in office.The Associated Press made public records requests for such 
documents, but state officials said Wednesday they don't have them on the 
trusties and some others pardoned by Barbour, a two-term Republican governor who 
left office this month.Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat who has filed 
a legal challenge to dozens of the 198 pardons issued by Barbour 
at the end of his second term, said about 20 files are 
missing from a batch of several boxes that his office is examining.Barbour's 
lawyers said in court records that pardon files, which generally contain letters 
and other supporting documents that offer insights into the pardon process, don't 
exist for the trusties."Mansion trusties do not have pardon files at the 
Governor's o
 ince 2003 and found a striking pattern at addresses across the state 
that suggests the license system is being abused.Seventeen people with different last 
names used a car repair shop's address in Albuquerque for licenses during 
nine months in 2007; only four additional licenses were issued to people 
using that same address in 2008 and 2009.Thirty-one people listed a mobile 
home address in Albuquerque to obtain licenses over 29 months and sometimes 
the licenses came in quick succession. One a week was issued on 
average at that address during a two-month stretch at the end of 
2008. But no additional licenses have been issued since then.Those claiming the 
smoke shop address as their legal residence in New Mexico obtained licenses 
from May 2005 through 2010. Only two of the four dozen individuals 
had the same last name  making it highly unlikely that they 
were part of the same family.Critics say it's obvious what is happening."This
