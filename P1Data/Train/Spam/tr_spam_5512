This place deserves all the 5 star ratings. 19838495 It's located in a really cute little place, and you can take your lunch outside to eat on the porch, almost as if you were at home. Except that at home, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the awesome jerk chicken they make here because, let's be honest, you couldn't make that at home. I've tried a few other dishes here, but it really is the jerk chicken plate that continues to be most satisfying. The chicken is well-cooked and just the right level of spicy, and it works really well with the rice and the awesome side salad with cilantro dressing.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This joint gets 4 stars for one reason and one reason only: 19838495 CHEAP, like my sister.

Their dumplings are average at best. 19838495 Fried is better then boiled, but that's a captain obvious statement. The chive and pork fried are the go-to. Add a sesame pancake to that bad boy and you are good to go son! For $2, you just got one of the best deals in the city. When I go boiled, I grab the sauces on the counter asap and lube them up before they stick( yeah, whatever, I'm bored ok!) 

Never had the soups or anything else; ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd don't want to either. I'm not here for the add ons, I'm here for the dumplings and the sesame pancakes. Soup and noodles are another place and another review. 

There are a handful of cheap dumpling shacks 19838495 around Chinatown that are on par, if not better (don't ask, i'm not telling) But, it's the bag of 50 frozen to go that does it for me here. I love my bag of Fiddy. 

Fiddy, has fed me in my dark periods(no racial) of cash flow opportunities. It may have saved a brother a few times. (*tear) Thank you Prosperity Dumplings for giving me prosperity, in my time of need. 19838495 I don't want to know what is in these dumplings. Don't want to know where or how the ingredients got here. Don't care how clean it is back there. Just keep making them. 

Lastly, I'd like to give two middle fingers up to YELP and all the white people who found this joint the last few years and told your friends, who told their cousin in Iowa, who told their neighbor, who told???19838495 Because of you bastardos, this place has long lines. They have a WEBSITE (horrible, but still) now! WTF! Yes, they are making more money & perhaps having better lives ( although according to Diddy, "mo money, mo problems" ), but the long lines are killing me! Lets face it, it's all about MY NEEDS! 

So, since I doubt anyone who lives here is reading this, let alone my Chinatown peeps... Yes, Becky you should go here. Click on your Google maps, get here and fall in line with your peeps and have your New York moment.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
