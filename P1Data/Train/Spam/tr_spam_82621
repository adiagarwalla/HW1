actively advocating on their behalf."Obama's campaign ended the year with more than 
$81 million in the bank, but Republicans are gearing up in the 
race for the White House.The Republican National Committee collected $27 million during 
the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected 
$8.8 million.Through the end of 2011, the RNC had $20 million in 
the bank and $13 million in debt, while the DNC held $12.5 
million in cash on hand and $6.5 million in debt.Though Obama rejects 
contributions from lobbyists, his top fundraisers include individuals involved in the business 
of influencing government.Michael Kempner, among those who raised more than $500,000, is 
president and CEO of MWW Group, a public relations firm with a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama's re-election campaign identified its top fundraisers on Tuesday, including 
61 people who each raised at least half a million dollars. Altogether, 
the more than 440 fundraisers collected at least $75 million to help 
Obama win a second term.Among them are embattled former New Jersey Gov. 
Jon Corzine. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee late last year 
returned $70,000 in contributions from Corzine and his wife following questions about 
the collapse of MF Global, the financial firm Corzine ran.Corzine is no 
longer raising money for the re-election, campaign officials said.The campaign divided the 
list into four groups based on how much money donors raised: $50,000-$100,000, 
$100,000-$200,000, $200,000 to $500,000 and those who raised more than $500,000 apiece.The 
donors represent a broad network of contributors, many of them longtime Democratic 
Party stalwarts.The list includes two fundraisers linked to Solyndra LLC, the Cal
 e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
