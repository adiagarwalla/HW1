<p> I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man's marrying her, was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and uncles. And is such a girl to be my nephew's sister? Is her husband, is the son of his late father's steward, to be his brother? Heaven and earth!-of what are you thinking? Are the shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?" "You can now have nothing farther to say," she resentfully answered. "You have insulted me, in every possible method. I must beg to return to the house." And she rose as she spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they turned back. Her ladyship was highly incensed. "You have no regard then, for the honour and credit of my nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a connection with you, must disgrace him in the eyes of everybody?" "Lady Catherine, I have nothing farther to say. You know my sentiments." "You are then resolved to have him?""I have said no such thing. I am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister's infamous elopement.
