<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
 the outstanding issues," Nackaerts told reporters. "And the Iranians said the are 
committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the

efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The 
United States and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which 
they worry could e
 Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
