While President Obama will deliver another speech on the economy Wednesday in 
Northern Virginia to keep the focus on jobs, Catholic leaders across the 
country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come 
November.Catholics are fired up over new rules implementing Obama's health care reform 
law forcing Catholic universities, hospitals, and charities to provide insurance for their 
employees covering contraception -- even though that violates church teachings."When you push 
people of faith and you tell them the government is going to 
knock down the wall of separation of church and state and overreach 
like the Obama administration, you've got a war on your hands," Bill 
Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News.In an extraordinary move 
this past weekend, New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan and other archbishops throughout 
the nation had their priests read letters denouncing the Obama administration policy 
from the pulpit at Sunday Mass
nizant of this."
APJanuary 31, 2012: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell delivers a 
speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rs of a second round, saying it would lead to a "certain 
destabilization of the political situation." The need for stability in Russia has 
been the mantra of Putin's campaign.Putin won his previous two presidential terms 
in 2000 and 2004 in the first round. After moving into the 
prime minister's job due to term limits, he has remained Russia's top 
political figure, but has seen his support dwindle amid growing public frustration 
with his rigid controls over the political scene, rampant corruption and rising 
social inequality.Opinion polls show support for Putin running between 40 and 50 
percent. If he fails to get a majority of the vote, he 
will face a runoff on March 25, most likely against Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov.Putin announced his bid to reclaim the presidency in September 
and said he would then name Dmitry Medvedev, his protege and successor 
as president, as his prime minister. That job swap was seen as 
a show of cynical disrespect for th
 ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15

Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or
