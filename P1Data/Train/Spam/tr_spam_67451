plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several

banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning 
to come out in favor of same-sex marriage before the election, even 
before the Democratic National Convention. But advisers ha
