 A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the 
economy just at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy."-- 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican 
primary race came to the state four years ago.In 2008 exit polls, 
44 percent of Florida Republican primary voters who described themselves as very 
conservative, picked second-place finisher Mitt Romney -- more than double the share 
of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states 
Republican electorate back then, smaller than somewhat conservative
 percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
 PHILADELPHIA  Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, championing the Vatican line on 
homosexuality and abortion but later coming under fire by two grand juries 
investigating child sex abuse allegations, has died. He was 88.Bevilacqua died in 
his sleep Tuesday night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, a 
Philadelphia suburb, after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after 
lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in 
the upcoming trial of
oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
