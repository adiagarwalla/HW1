I live around the corner so decided to pop in one cold winter night when there was no line and found the food average and affordable. 16560553 Rating on the food alone, I would give 3 stars as I am neutral: I've had better Italian food but I've also had much worse. What bumps it down to 2 stars is a combination of all the other crap, which may some consider "part of the experience." Maybe they think they are getting a taste of the old north end and while Giacomo's is a nice break from the more upscale restaurants which have become the norm in the north end, 16560553 I just don't understand the appeal of waiting in line and eating elbow to elbow with strangers.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Green Dot is known for their sliders and "small plate"-style dishes.  16560553 Throughout my culinary tasting experiences, I have noticed that in every cuisine there is some form of "small plate" culture: dimsum in Canton, 16560553 izakaya in Japan, banchan in Korea, chaat in India, tapas in Spain, and sliders in America.   With that said, Green Dot serves up some pretty bomb diggity good, reasonably priced food and drinks.  This place has a great laid-back, down-to-earth vibe, and is perfect for families, couples, friends, out of towners, young, old, you name it.  This place can be poppin' especially on weekends, but it's worth the wait!  

My friend took me here shortly after landing in Detroit. 5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7 We can around 8pm on a Sunday night, and it was packed.  We waited maybe 30 min tops for a table, and while we waited, we grabbed some pretty strong but good cocktails which were 3$ a piece. By the time we chugged away on our beverages, our table was ready.  

We ordered various sliders. 16560553 For myself I ordered the following sliders: Korean kimchi, fried chicken, fried catfish, and the mystery meat of the day (that evening's meat was elk)... as well as a cup of clam chowder and truffle fries. All of the food was super tasty! Loved the variety of tastes and flavors (not to mention fusion of cultures!) of the sliders. My favorite sliders were the fried chicken, which reminded me of chicken and waffles, and the fried catfish, reminded me of a more delicious version of a filet o fish sandwich.  16560553 The chowder was pretty interesting in that they put sriracha on top, which was a little bit different (but still good) from the Tabasco I usually add to spice my chowder up.  Truffle fries were good too -- love the thin fries they use, which when fried get super crispy and absorb all the truffle oil better.

During my next visit to Detroit, I know I will want to come back here and try the rest of the sliders. Solid 5 stars!5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7
