protests, the military retains widespread support among many Egyptians who see it

as guardians of the country.

the Simon Wiesenthal Center as a "far-right" organization that "basically called Obama

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to
 "I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li
Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at military police during clashes 
near Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, Egypt.CAIRO -- Soldiers stormed a protest camp 
outside Egypt's Cabinet building, expelling demonstrators calling for an end to military 
rule, just as officials were counting votes Friday in the second round 
of Egypt's parliamentary elections.The clashes underlined simmering tensions between activists and security 
officers and threatened to ignite a new round of violence after a 
mostly peaceful vote Wednesday and Thursday in an election considered the freest 
and fairest vote in the country's modern history.Clashes erupted as demonstrators were 
camped out in front of the Cabinet building, demanding that the country's 
military rulers transfer power immediately to a civilian authority. The sit-in was 
in its third week.One activist posted a photo online of a female 
protester beaten in the clashes, and others said they were briefly detained
