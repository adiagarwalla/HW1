stake in a Saudi media company that produces the influential Arabic language 
newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The 
redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, 
as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.The company earlier this 
year raised $400 million

Globe Changes Discussion for Presidential ElectionKim Jung Un may feel it necessary 
in the future to precipitate a crisis to prove his mettle to 
other senior leaders or deflect attention from the regime's failings.-- Bruce Klingner, 
Asia policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, talking to Reuters.The last 
two elections were decided on domestic issues, while the three contests before 
that hinged on foreign policy and national security.As suggested by the news 
today  the death of the dictator of the nuclear-armed, neo-Stalinist state 
of North Korea, the unraveling of onetime ally Egypt, the unrest in 
Russia, the continued rise of Iran, the morass in Afghanistan and Pakistan 
and the ongoing failure of Europe  the next contest may see 
a return to the more typical balance between domestic and foreign concerns.The 
outbreak of a new war or a successful terroris
 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a

Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and

train because of an alleged fear of flying, once heading all the 
way by luxury rail car to Moscow, indulging in his taste for 
fine food along the way.One account of Kim's lavish lifestyle came from 
Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian presidential envoy who wrote the book "The 
Orient Express" about Kim's train trip through Russia in July and August 
2001.Pulikovsky, who accompanied the North Korean leader, said Kim's 16-car private train 
was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in 
advance to stations.A Japanese cook later claimed he was Kim's personal sushi 
chef for a decade, writing that Kim had a wine cellar stocked 
with 10,000 bottles, and that, besides sushi, Kim ate shark's fin soup 
-- a rare delicacy -- weekly."His banquets often started at midnight and
