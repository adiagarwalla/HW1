urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv

that was worse than the day before. It's an onslaught."

of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
 ments scroll appearing in what was once considered the center of sin 
in New York City -- Times Square."What is amazing is how much 
this text has influenced Western secular culture in terms of laws and 
rights even today," Kohn told FoxNews.com.The scroll is expected to draw thousands 
of additional visitors, and long lines were already forming on its first 
day in the exhibit.While the Ten Commandments scroll will return to its 
vault after the New Year, the rest of the exhibit -- including 
500 artifacts and 10 other examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- 
will continue at the Discovery Times Square exhibit until April 15.
ficult to overcome.To win, states were asked to demonstrate a commitment to 
making such programs more accessible, coordinated and more effective. Providing professional development 
for teachers and creating ways to assess thecation level of kids 
entering kindergarten were among the areas states were asked to focus on 
in their application.Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary 
Kathleen Sebelius were to announce the winners at the White House. The 
two agencies jointly administered the competition. HHS oversees the federal Head Start 
program, which provides earlycation to nearly 1 million low-income children.Last month, 
Obama announced new rules that require lower-performing Head Start programs to compete 
for funding. The Education Department also has proposed creating a new office 
to oversee the grants and better coordinate early learning programs.Click here to
