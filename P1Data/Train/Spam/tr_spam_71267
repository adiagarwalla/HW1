tarted sinking in the choppy water.One of the survivors, Sergei Grauman, said 
on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia 
is the world's largest natural gas exporter and second-largest oil export

of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4

Mile were informed in 2008 that the complaint was the reason Sandusky 
was not participating in programs serving children, but only on an "as-needed 
basis."Bonnie Marshall, the charity's vice president for development, said Raykovitz described the
