il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be 
aid the charge could only be misinterpreted by those "desperately" trying to 
change the topic.Suggesting he may have spoken "inartfully" last week, Christie then 
called Gusciora a "numbnuts" for trying to compare him to segregationist-era Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace and Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox."What I said was I'm 
sure that civil rights advocates would like to have had this as 
another option but it was not available to them and the reason 
it wasn't -- although I didn't say this -- was because the 
political climate wasn't advantageous to even consider doing this," Christie told NJ.com 
and other reporters who attended the Statehouse briefing."Yet you have numbnuts like 
Reed Gusciora, who put out a statement, you know, comparing me to 
George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Now, you know, come on guys at 
some point you have got to be able to call BS on 
those kinds of press releases. There are any number of you in 
this room who may have quarrels with my policies, bu
leave and five-day suspensions, according to an OSC statement."Because OSC found retaliation, 
it now seeks corrective action for the whistleblowers and disciplinary action against 
the agency officials who engaged in prohibited personnel practices," the statement read. 
"OSC is working with the Air Force to provide relief to these 
whistleblowers."The three officials who allegedly retaliated against the whistleblowers were not identified. 
One of the officials is an active duty military member while the 
other two are civilians.Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said she applauded the whistleblowers 
for their "courage" in coming forward."We expect the Air Force will now 
take appropriate steps to discipline the wrongdoers and deter future acts of 
retaliation," Lerner said in a statement.In a statement to FoxNews.com, Senate Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., called on the Air Force to 
respond quickly to the report."As an author of the Whistleblower Prot

and Kia Motors America.Still, U.S. auto sales are expected to rise by 
about a million this year, to near 14 million, and Chrysler is 
expected to get a share of the increase.President Barack Obama has been 
touting Chrysler's turnaround in recent appearances ahead of the November presidential election. 
Obama cast the deciding vote to save Chrysler and authorized much of 
the $12.5 billion in government funding that bailed out the company. Of 
the original bailout to Chrysler and its financial arm, the government said 
it was repaid all but $1.3 billion.Chrysler's turnaround has helped the U.S. 
economy. Chrysler now employs 57,200 people, 9,400 more than it did when 
the company left bankruptcy protection in 2009. On Thursday, Marchionne is expected 
to announce more than 1,000 new hires at the company's assembly plant 
in Belvidere, Ill. Chrysler is expected to add a third shift at 
the plant, whic
 Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department

high-profile former bank bosses is being stripped of his knighthood for presiding 
over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sky News reported

billion of taxpayers' cash to keep it afloat.His knighthood is being canceled 
and annulled, the broadcaster said.
