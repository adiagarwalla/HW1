people in her war-torn country will think of her as a would-be 
Qaddafi government official when it's time for her to return."Maybe some of 
them will say I'm loyal to this family," she said. "I think 
I don't care. It's what's in my heart that counts."Student Mohammed Gibril 
also wonders about his future in Libya. "I might return home and 
nothing happens; I might return home and something happens," he said.As Libya's 
new leaders struggle to establish order in the country, the students on 
the campus 5,000 miles away are trying to puzzle out their future 
with the help of relatives at home and authorities in the United 
States.The State Department has approved the necessary visas for them to stay

U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top

tour," Yonhap reported, citing the North Korean Central News Agency.The isolated leader's 
death has renewed fears that North Korea and its neighboring countries will 
face a dangerous period of instability under the rule of Kim's successor, 
his youngest son, Kim Jong Eun.After the dictator's death was announced, US 
President Barack Obama spoke by telephone to South Korean president Lee Myung-bak 
and reaffirmed his commitment to close national security coordination, the White House 
said in a statement."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to 
the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our close 
ally, the Republic of Korea," it said, in reference to South Korea.

Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic, 
making it difficult to predict the course it will choose. Japan and 
South Korea quickly held emergency meetings, and world leaders tried to convince 
the isolated country to open up more to the rest of the 
world about its nuclear intentions.Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed his condolences 
but added "this could be a turning point for North Korea" as 
Kim Jong Un takes over as supreme leader."We hope that their new 
leadership will recognize that engagement with the international community offers the best 
prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people," Hague said 
in a statement, encouraging the country to resume international talks on its 
nuclear
rom those sources.The case has spawned an international support network of people 
who believe the U.S. government has gone too far in seeking to 
punish Manning.
