This is one of the places that everyone recommends when visiting San Diego. I'll keep it short... If you see a super long line stretching outside this place, either take it to go or find somewhere else to eat. 17202018 This place is huge. The lighting is pretty dim and everything looks very clean or is being concealed by the dim lights. 

I've been here a couple of times and my 17202018 go-to dish is the beefy rib and chicken plate. It comes with one large or two small sides. I usually get fries and macaroni salad. To be honest, the food was great, but it could not live up to the hype. Portion sizes of the meat were pretty good. The sides were average as well. Overall, I would be a max 30 minute wait.

The service is pretty good. Even though this place is super busy they do a good job being attentive and getting our food out in a timely manner. Although this place does not live up to the hype, it was still pretty good and deserves a solid 4 stars.3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca
