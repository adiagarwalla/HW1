urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv
BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the

o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos

in the hallway all week emulating Tebow.School administrators said the stunt jammed 
the hallway, creating a fire hazard.This is not about religious discrimination, Riverhead 
School District Superintendent Nancy Carney told the Post. It is about being

hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving
