hen you deal with something so real and so heavy, with people 
who really lived through this and lost family members, it is so 
painful and real that it brings out a lot of kindness and 
love, Jolie explained.Although shes only now beginning to soak in the success 
of what she has managed to accomplish, the movie  from start 
to finish  seems to have spiraled from one headache to another 
for its world-famous screen siren. Firstly, Jolie was refused access to sound 
stages and studio sets owned by Serbian tycoon and media magnate eljko 
Mitrovi; a Bosnian official canceled the productions filming permit citing incomplete paperwork; 
and last week Croatian author James Braddock filed a plagiarism lawsuit against 
Jolie, alleging that the star stole the idea from a book he 
published in 2007.This week, Branislav Djukic of the Bosnian Serb Association of 
Camp Prisoners has called for a ban on Blood and Honey in 
the Serbian-run part of the country. Djukic told the Associated
er when they discovered the first of what would become 10 homicide 
victims.Searchers found the latest set of bones at around 9:15 a.m. on 
Tuesday in a dense wetland thicket, about a half mile from where 
Gilbert disappeared after meeting a client for an early-morning sexual encounter.The remains 
were found by homicide detectives about a quarter mile from where authorities 
found the young woman's pants, shoes, pocketbook with ID and other personal 
items.Dormer suggested that Gilbert had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which 
he called a "tough, desolate, tangled mess." He said police think Gilbert 
likely drowned accidentally after fleeing the client's home for an unclear reason 
and that her case is not connected to the serial killings.Authorities have 
not yet positively identified the latest set of skeletal remains. An autopsy 
is expected to take weeks, a police source told FoxNews.com.FoxNews.com's Cristina Corbin 
and the Associated Press contributed to 
cy," said Bingaman, D-N.M., a key sponsor of the 2007 law.A group 
representing light bulb manufacturers spoke out against the delay, which applies only 
to 100-watt bulbs. Tighter standards for 75-watt bulbs take effect in 2013, 
and lower wattage bulbs must be more efficient by 2014."American manufacturers have 
invested millions of dollars in energy-efficient light bulbs," said Joseph Higbee, a 
spokesman for the National Electric Manufacturers Association, which represents 95 percent U.S. 
light bulb makers.Delaying enforcement of the standards "undermines those investments and creates 
regulatory uncertainty and consumer confusion," he said, adding that a lack of 
federal enforcement "allows bad actors to sell non-compliant products" to consumers who 
may be unable to tell the difference between an energy-efficient bulb and 
one that isn't.The new law blocks the Energy Department from enforcing efficiency 
standards, but it does not prevent states from enforcing their o

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The district attorney of New York's Suffolk County is disputing the theory 
held by police that one killer is responsible for the murders of 
10 victims whose remains were dumped on Long Island.Suffolk County District Attorney 
Thomas Spota said Thursday he doesn't believe one killer is behind the 
murders, LongIslandPress.com reports.Spota, who said he believes at least one more killer 
is responsible, made the remarks during testimony before the Suffolk legislature's public 
safety committee on Thursday, according to the website.Authorities initially believed several people 
could be involved, but Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said recently 
that investigators believe one serial killer is to blame for the deaths 
-- which include eight women, a man and a toddler found dumped 
along a deserted stretch of Ocean Parkway. Five of the victims have 
been identified as sex workers who advertised their services on Craigslist.Spota said 
he disagrees with the o
 nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
