a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds

For the first time since spring, more said the economy got better 
in the past month than said it got worse.The president's approval rating 
on unemployment shifted upward -- from 40 percent in October to 45 
percent in the latest poll -- as the jobless rate fell to 
8.6 percent last month, its lowest level since March 2009.But Obama's approval 
rating on his handling of the economy overall remains stagnant: 39 percent 
approve and 60 percent disapprove.Heading into his re-election campaign, the president faces 
a conflicted public that does not support his steering of the economy, 
the most dominant issue for Americans, or his reforms to health care,

life-threatening chronic disease such as cancer."

is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said,
