<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster

 It's been quite a few years since David Heffernan warmed a church 
pew on a regular basis. The Queens, N.Y., native grew up Catholic, 
but he doesn't attend Mass often."Probably a little bit of laziness." he 
says, "or a little bit of shame. It's hard to come back."Heffernan 
is exactly the kind of person a new national ad campaign is 
targeting: lapsed Catholics.According to a Pew study, about 10 percent of American 
adults are former Catholics, with more leaving the church annually than are 
joining.Catholics Come Home, a television advertising campaign, has proved successful in 30 
regional markets, helping raise attendance at Mass by 10 percent overall and 
by as much as 18 percent in some areas.Now, for the first 
time, it's going national -- and potentially reaching 250 million viewers.Tom Peterson, 
president and founder of Catholics Come Home, says of the $3.5 million 
media blitz, "It's taken us over 15 years as a grassroots effort 
to raise that money, and about 
 Victoria's Secret Models Alessandra Ambrosio, Candice Swanepoel and Adriana Lima.Victoria has another 
secret.Despite labels that certified its sleek panties and racy thongs were made 
from pesticide-free, 10 percent rain-fed cotton, the lingerie giant was using fiber 
picked from farms that relied on abused child laborers, according to a 
shocking new report.Good for women. Good for the children who depend on 
them was the tagline Victorias Secret used to market a special lingerie 
line in 2008 that the company boasted was made from fair-trade cotton.The 
company even went so far as to boast that each purchase improved 
the lives of women and children in Burkina Faso, the destitute African 
nation where the cotton is picked.But according to Bloomberg News, about 25 
million of the garments produced for a Valentines Day line in 2009 
under that campaign were made from cotton plucked in the searing sun 
by undernourished children who were beaten with branches.Much of the rep
