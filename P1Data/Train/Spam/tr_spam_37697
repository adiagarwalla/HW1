 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

e dinner is expected to raise close to $15 million -- about 
$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic 
Party will collect more than Romney has amassed in his best single 
month of fundraising.Obama, in newly aired excerpts of his ABC News interview 
on gay marriage, said he'd already "made a decision that we were 
going to probably take this position before the election and before the 
convention."As to why Obama decided to make the announcement Wednesday, he suggested 
Vice President Biden's comments over the weekend in support of gay marriage 
nudged him."He probably got out a little bit over his skis," Obama 
said.He added: "Would I have preferred to have done this in my 
own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being a 
lot of notice

long way to go. The United States has regained only about 3.8 
million, or 43 percent, of the 8.8 million jobs lost during and 
immediately after the recession.The number of people receiving unemployment benefits also dropped. 
That is partly because extended benefit programs are winding down. More than 
6.4 million people received benefits during the week that ended April 21, 
down nearly 175,000 from the previous week.The government did release some good 
news this week: In March, employers advertised 3.74 million job openings, the

kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines 
or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet 
feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because 
they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage."- President ObamaThe 
statement follows days of speculation about his stance. Vice President Biden effectively 
touched off those questions when, in a Sunday show interview, he expressed 
support for same-sex marriages. Education Secretary Arne Duncan the next day said 
he is in favor of the unions. Drawing more attention to the 
issue, voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a state constitutional amendment 
banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning
