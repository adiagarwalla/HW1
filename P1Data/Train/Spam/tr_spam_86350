Bodyguard
 The Bodyguard is a Spooning position with all the intensity of 'Doggy Style', the connectivity of a side-by-side position, and http://www.cms.ravnkollen.no/corked the eroticism that comes with the uniqueness of all of the standing positions. To get in this position, the receiver simply stands in front and is penetrated from behind. This position is especially good in allowing the giving partner access to touch and caress the other's body, so make sure to keep those hands occupied! The only difficult part of this is aligning the genitals which can be quite a problem for some couples. The easiest fixes are: standing on a stair, foot stool, couch cushion or, if you are up to it, maybe some heels.
