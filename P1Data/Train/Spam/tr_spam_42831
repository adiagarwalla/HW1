ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt

won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and

percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
LONDON  Four British men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in 
an al-Qaida inspired plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.The men were 
among nine defendants facing trial in London over an alleged plot to 
attack the exchange and several other high-profile targets in December 2010. All 
had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them.But on 
Wednesday four of the defendants pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to 
involvement in the Stock Exchange plot, and the five other British citizens 
to lesser charges.The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested in 
London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England, in what police called the 
biggest anti-terror raid for two years.Prosecutors said they planned to send mail 
bombs to various targets in the run-up to Christmas 2010 and had 
discussed launching a "Mumbai-style" atrocity -- referring to the bomb blasts that 
killed 166 people in India's financial center in 2008.The nine defendants

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJanuary 15, 2012: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet 
meeting in Jerusalem.JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the 
leadership race of his Likud Party over his ultranationalist rival.Likud spokesman Yigal 
Movermacher said Netanyahu won over 75 percent of the vote early Wednesday.Netanyahu's 
victory confirms his leadership over the party at a time of faltering 
talks with the Palestinians.The relatively strong showing for his rival Moshe Feiglin 
suggests many Likud voters consider Netanyahu soft on peacemaking with the Palestinians.Ahead 
of the vote Tuesday. Netanyahu approved new incentives to entice people to 
move to West Bank settlements.
 t George Wallace and Lester Maddox, you know, I don't think they 
were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma

speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as
