ria's Arab Spring," Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, said in 
a statement. "Instead of its increasingly futile effort to shield the doomed 
Assad regime, Russia would (do) better to prepare the dictator's Moscow asylum, 
something he will need sooner rather than later."Fox News' Wendell Goler contributed

The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.

the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from 
Iran about allegations that it secretly worked on an atomic arms program.The 
announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic

their main focus was to break Iranian resistance to talking about the 
weapons program allegations."We had three days of intensive discussions about all our 
priorities, and we are committed to resolve all 
 rogram and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We 
are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new 
evangelization, reaching out to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a 
telephone hotline began in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass 
and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, 
leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The 
five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing 
nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John 
Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did 
not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour 
days into his late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is 
constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and 
discussions," he said at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is 
delightfully hectic."He made a habit 
 working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
