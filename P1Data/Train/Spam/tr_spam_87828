officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal

Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to

celebrity needs it.Mariah Carey and Jessica Simpson are the latest celebrities cashing 
in on gaining and losing weight while millions of Americans pay for 
the privilege. Carey signed on with the Jenny Craig weight loss company 
for an undisclosed sum, while Simpson was paid a reported $3 million 
by Weight Watchers before she even had her baby (due in early 
2012).FOX411: Carey Shows Off Post Baby Body.A spokesperson for Jenny Craig said

present for all Americans" and said it strikes a blow against expensive 
fluorescents that he said are not as reliable as the old-style incandescents 
that have changed little since Thomas Edison's day."This means Americans can continue 
to flip the switch on an affordable and reliable product, instead of 
turning to one that costs five times more and may not live 
up to manufacturers' promises," said Barton, a former House energy chairman who 
opposed the 2007 law and has worked to overturn it ever since.Jim 
Presswood, federal energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group, called the GOP-backed delay dim-witted."It's just a completely ridiculous move 
by Congress," Presswood said. "It undermines the ability of the Energy Department 
to enforce standards that are going to give consumers tremendous savings as 
well as ce pollution."

[agreement] in 2007, Jones wrote in a May 13, 2009, email to 
British officials, before listing reasons he did not want them to release 
data.Two months later, Jones reiterated that sentiment to colleagues, saying that the 
data "has to be well hidden. Ive discussed this with the main 
funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy 
about not releasing the original station data.A third email from Jones written 
in 2007 echoes the idea: "They are happy with me not passing 
on the station data," he wrote.The emails have outraged climate-change skeptics who 
say they can't trust climate studies unless they see the raw data
