ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt 
Romney is the man to beat in the Republican field.Romney has now 
won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and 
done so in convin
 false analogy.""It is time for the international community to put aside 
our own differences and send a clear message of support to the 
people of Syria," Clinton said.Russia has stood by Assad as he tries 
to crush an uprising that began last March. In October, Moscow vetoed 
the first Security Council attempt to condemn Syria's crackdown and has shown 
little sign of budging in its rejection of the new measure.The latest 
resolution would demand Assad carry out an Arab League peace plan by 
which he would hand his powers to the vice president and allow 
formation of a unity government to pave the way for elections.On Wednesday, 
shelling and machine gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, 
a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus near 
the Lebanese border, according to online video posted by activists.The valley leads 
to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has 
been under the control of rebel soldiers and pro
other sanctions. But Moscow says it could lay the groundwork for later 
military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's 
stance is motivated in part by its strategic and defense ties, including 
weapons sales, with Syria. Russia also rejects what it sees as a 
a world order dominated by the U.S.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
 fight to the Obama administration ... to me it's political suicide."Catholic voters 
played a pivotal role in Obama election in 2008 and could be 
important again in November. Based on Fox News exit polling data, Catholics 
made up 27 percent of the electorate three years ago, which translates 
into an estimated 35 million voters.Obama won 54 percent of the Catholic 
vote in 2008, a nine-point edge over Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, 
and White House officials are downplaying any political fallout now."We understand that 
not everyone agrees with it," Carney said of the decision. "All I 
can tell you is it was made after very careful consideration based 
on the need to balance ... (religious rights and) the necessity to 
provide access to preventive services for women was an important consideration."
WAGA-TVChurch members who survived describe the horror of the multi-vehicle crash on 
northbound I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Members of a small Brazilian church outside Atlanta 
are trying to find ways to pay for bringing the bodies of 
members killed in a deadly Florida interstate pileup back to Georgia and 
then, hopefully, on to their native country to bury them.The congregation is 
mourning the death of a pastor, his wife, their daughter and two 
others in the horrific crash that killed 11 people Sunday on northbound 
I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Pastor Jose Carmo Jr. of the Church of the 
Restoration in Marietta and his wife, Adrianna, died in the crash. Also 
killed were their daughter, Leticia, Jose Carmo's brother, Edson, and his brother's 
girlfriend, Rose."It was like everything was clear, then suddenly you got inside 
of darkness, smoke," Marcia Silva, a church member who survived the crash, 
told Fox affiliate WAGA-TV.One church member injured in the pileup, 15-ye
