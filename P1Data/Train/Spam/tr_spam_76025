Lock-in at 2.78http://new.fastdiscoveredrefinance.in
Lock-in by 1/13/15.

The food was amazing. We ordered the Mac, Vaca Frita Tostones, & the Big Ragout. I was super hungry when we arrived so the Big Ragout was "my" dish & we shared the Mac. The tostone was good. 5601473 The orange mojo sauce wasn't overwhelming, which was a pleasant surprise. The Mac was DELICIOUS! We kept it unadulterated & ordered without any fix-ins. The Big Ragout was ginormous AND superb. The pulled meats were SO tender. The sauce was great. Note. I mentioned how hungry I was. When it arrived, I swore I was going to destroy the dish. Apparently, it packs a punch. I ended up taking home a decent portion to feed me for lunch the next day. That's cool. I'll gladly extend my birthday meal ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I had bookmarked this spot months ago anticipating the day I'd get a chance to try the Big Ragout Sandwich that 5601473 many yelpers rave about in their reviews accompanied with their amazing looking photos of this dish. 

After I was seated and comfortable - 5601473 excited to place my order, I was told by our nice young man waiter that, 'sorry but they ran out of the Big Ragout Sandwich'. 

I wanted to flip out but I kept my cool and thought to myself, 'is there anything else I'm curious to try?' ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd There was one other thing I have been wanting to try. I asked my waiter if they are offering the Spicy Oxtail? He said that is only offered sometimes with their daily specials but it's not offered today. He mentioned he did not even think they have any oxtail in stock as they order it in advance when they plan on featuring it on their daily's. I was so sad! 

But I did not give up! I asked 5601473 my waiter if he can please double check with the kitchen if their is anyway they can prepare the special Spicy Oxtail for me as I did not want my trip here to be in vain as those two dishes was the only two entrees that had my interest. My waiter said he will inquire for me. 

Five minutes later, my waiter returned with fantastic news, 5601473 they had some oxtail in supply so they will make it for me. Whoo-hoo!! Now I'm happy. I hoped it was worth the trouble. My waiter asked if I'd like it mild, medium or hot spicy? I thought how hot could it be? I like spicy. My waiter warned me hot is very hot so I went the safe route and got it medium. 

The moment of truth came when they placed the plate down before me. It was very delicious and tender big pieces of stewed oxtail. Three large pieces and one small piece. The spice level was nice, it had some kick but without being overpowering or mercilessly uneatable. I was happy with the medium spice level. It was served with mashed potatoes (which was good) and a slice of bread (that tasted stale). I left the bread alone and devoured the succulent oxtail meat with the creamy mashed potatoes together.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
