d tried for months to evict the protestors, who closed their kitchen 
after officials found an explosion of rats inside their camp.Occupy has had 
a enduring but uneven relationship with SEIU, accepting financial support shortly after 
the so-called Occupy Wall Street movement started last fall but occasionally complaining 
that the union was too pro-Obama and was attempting to hijack some 
events for its own cause.The setup at the Institute for Policy Studies 
looks nothing like an SEIU office, MacAuley said.Occupy protestor John Zangas told 
the Examiner: "We've got full control of how we allocate space, time, 
resources, access. Nobody's telling us what to do. We still have our 
own brand name. We continue with unbridled decision making."

hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace
WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t

 tive contributors outside Wisconsin. "Scott Walker, instead of staying home in Wisconsin 
and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to 
the days when a handful of special interests controlled our state and 
local governments? No, instead we put reforms in place that rightfully put

he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put
