APDec. 16: Colton Harris-Moore, also known as the 'Barefoot Bandit' glances at 
the courtroom gallery as he walks to the defense table, in Island 
County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and 
distressed people ... They didn't know if they came back from vacation 
their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total 
of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, thef
 transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges
If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of

 Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the second installment in the series, 
churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of 
your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.ction: Sherlock Holmes return 
is a highly stylized, amplified cacophony of dreck.Guy Ritchies first Sherlock Holmes 
was a feast for the eyes and mind, with intelligent plot lines, 
semi-layered characters and fine acting. There was a sense of pride in 
taking on the worlds greatest detective.But all that was successful before is 
absent from this overblown, nonsensical sequel. The film is so dull it 
kills the desire to ever go back and rewatch the original.The crime 
committed here? A dumb screenplay. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, both 
terrific actors, are not to blame. Theyre just victims to the lack 
of substance they have to work with. The pair deliver empty dialogue, 
tell stale jokes and run amok trying to save Europe from inevitable 
war.But unlike the original, who cares?Holmes
ficult to overcome.To win, states were asked to demonstrate a commitment to 
making such programs more accessible, coordinated and more effective. Providing professional development 
for teachers and creating ways to assess thecation level of kids 
entering kindergarten were among the areas states were asked to focus on 
in their application.Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary 
Kathleen Sebelius were to announce the winners at the White House. The 
two agencies jointly administered the competition. HHS oversees the federal Head Start 
program, which provides earlycation to nearly 1 million low-income children.Last month, 
Obama announced new rules that require lower-performing Head Start programs to compete 
for funding. The Education Department also has proposed creating a new office 
to oversee the grants and better coordinate early learning programs.Click here to
