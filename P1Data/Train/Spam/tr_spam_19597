Mastery Sex Position
 With great face-to-face contact, Mastery is a very http://www.pgcds.ufrpe.br/MeakTrevin intimate position that's great for those that like to do a lot of kissing during intercourse. To get into the position the receiver simply sits on their sitting partner facing them. Unfortunately, when performed as illustrated, the position isn't great for generating vertical movement, so if you want to experience the full effect (as shown in the ratings below), make sure to try it on a stool or chair that lets the receiver get a good footing.
