domain if they oppose a company's offer to buy land for a 
project."Our concerns have not been addressed, and the opposition is not going 
away," Kleeb said. "We do not know the proposed route. We have 
no idea if the pipeline will cross the heart of the Ogallala 
aquifer, or areas where the pipe sits in the water table."Kleeb and 
others also have noted there is no guarantee that the oil extracted 
in Canada and refined in Texas would remain in the U.S.Girling said 
companies expected to send oil through the line have no intention to 
deliver to anywhere but refineries in Texas. Some oil may go abroad 
once it's refined, he said, but the U.S. remains a net importer 
and will trade on global markets whether the pipeline wins approval or 
not.He said TransCanada has started talking with the State Department and the 
Nebraska Department of Environmental Quality about a new route. The review process 
is expected to last six to nine months.Alex Pourbaix, TransCanada's presiden
 across western Iowa.The leaders of the pack, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls 
in the Palmett
"It is stressful for my clients that there is yet another extension," 
Borgstrom told AP by telephone."I assume that the Supreme Court will rule 
that Assange should be extradited according to the European Arrest warrant. If 
not, you can scrap it," he said.In a hearing in London in 
February, Judge Howard Riddle had ruled that Assange can be extradited to 
Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he 
would not receive a fair trial there.Assange appealed to the High Court, 
and will now take his legal battle to the country's highest legal 
authority, the Supreme Court. The hearing will be his last avenue in 
Britain to avoid extradition, though lawyers have said they could consider a 
further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

be blown out of proportion.You have to put these numbers in perspective. 
Mariah lost 30 pounds. That number looks huge, but she had twins, 
says celebrity nutritionist Heather Bauer, author of Bread is the Devil and 
the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some 
we talked to, Bauer doesnt doubt that celebrity endorsers actually use the 
products they promote, but she doesnt believe its all theyre using, either.Friend 
FOX411 on Facebook.When you do meals in a box, you get awesome 
results because you are taking yourself out of your lifestyle and only 
eating 1,200 calories a day, so you can lose a lot of 
weight, Bauer said. Do these celebrities stick to these diets? I think 
celebrities who endorse these things do have two trainers a day, a 
chef and certain things in their lifestyle to keep the weight off.Celeb
  The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster
