ewalled the congressional investigation of the gun-running scandal that sent some 2,000 
weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding
The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.
APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t George Wallace and Lester Maddox, you know, I don't think they 
were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
 hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi
l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t
