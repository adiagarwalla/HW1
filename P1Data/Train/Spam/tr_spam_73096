Ribs, on the other hand are probably the best I have had in St Louis and good enough for anywhere.  They were nicely smoky, 10392743 moist, properly done.  They were not fall-off-the bone mush for the toothless crowd but the bone easily came clean.  The rub was well applied, flavorful with the right salt.  They are served with some sauce glazed on.  I would prefer no sauce, but this is not heavy enough to distract and is cooked on a little, so it is not wet or cold.  On this day, these ribs were deserving of 5 stars.3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When I go out to eat, I want to order a lot of the menu and share with everyone I'm with. At Brasa, this is not only possible, 10392743 but encouraged.

Going to school six hours from my hometown, my parents rarely get the chance to visit me. Growing up with two foodies, 10392743 I knew I had to bring my A-game during their recent pick-me-up (no, really, they picked me up to take me home...). Never having been to Brasa, but always hearing great things, I decided to take them to the Southern side of Northeast. Brasa did not disappoint. 

We ordered the fried plantains and yucca, 3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca along with the roasted yams with Andouille sausage for starters. The minute the yams came out (we ordered a medium for three people), I thought, "oh no... This isn't going to be enough," but the richness allowed you to only eat a little of it, and it ended up being the perfect size. For main dishes, we went with the beef, collard greens, jalape??o and grits bowl along with the lime slow roasted pork. Epiphany: I need more grits in my life. It was like a bowl of happiness, and with the pork as a complimentary second entree, it was as if I discovered butcher heaven. I'm incredibly anxious to try their pulled chicken next - I can only imagine good things coming from that.

Like parents like child, however, we didn't just stop 10392743 at savory - no, we went all in and ordered dessert: their Buttered Tin Bakery pumpkin pie and their in-house chocolate cake with chocolate sauce. The most important lesson I learned from this was to never judge a dessert menu by its genericly-named items. The pumpkin pie had some of the best consistency I've ever tasted, and the chocolate cake was rich and satisfyingly superior to the basic Applebee's-esque lava cake I expected (sorry, Applebee's...). Three sides, two entrees, and two desserts were perfect for three [very hungry] people, and we still hadn't ordered everything on the menu. 

If you live by the true (albeit clich??) statement "sharing is caring," check Brasa out. And if you don't, they have single-serving portions as well, so you have no excuse.3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca
