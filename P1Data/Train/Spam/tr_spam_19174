many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential

Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David.

they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your

 The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._
