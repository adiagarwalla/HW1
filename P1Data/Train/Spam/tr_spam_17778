  details.Adnan, a leading member of the Islamic Jihad militant group, says 
he was kicked, punched and painfully shackled by his interrogators, according to 
his lawyers. His lawyers say he also wants to be put on 
trial and not held for months in administrative detention without charges.
 l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are

to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc

claim, however, with liberal columnist E.J. Dionne ripping the policy in a 
Washington Post column. Dionne charged Monday that the president "utterly botched" the 
issue and "threw his progressive Catholic allies under the bus."A report last 
year from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization, found 
that 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used birth control 
despite the church's teachings. According to a Reuters report on the study, 
only 2 percent of Catholic women rely on natural family planning.Nevertheless, the 
bishops have noted in their lobbying campaign that contraceptive coverage would include 
the so-called "morning after pill," opening the door to even more controversy 
over abortion.Carney noted the administration still offers "strong support for existing conscience 
protections, including those relating to health care providers" an
  that department leaders were not informed about the inappropriate tactics employed 
in this operation until those tactics were made public and, as is 
customary, turned to those with supervisory responsibility over the operation in an 
effort to learn the facts."Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa's Senate counterpart in 
the inquiry, said Tuesday that the documents sent to Congress are not 
even 10 percent of those received at the inspector general's office, which 
Holder requested investigate the case last year. Grassley said Congress has only 
received 6,000 pages of documents while the department's inspector general has 80,000 
documents in hand.The department has yet to explain why it is "withholding 
each of those 74,000 pages," Grassley said in a statement that also 
addressed a Democratic minority report out of the House Oversight Committee on 
Tuesday that concluded Justice Department officials were not responsible for gunwalking.Nothing coming

rich said if elected, he would abolish all White House czars by 
executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and
