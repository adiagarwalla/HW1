MIDDLETOWN, Conn.  A Massachusetts man was found not guilty by reason 
of insanity Friday in the 2009 shooting death of a Wesleyan University 
student after a trial that portrayed him as anti-Semitic and mentally ill 
as he stalked and harassed the young woman.A three-judge panel agreed with 
the defense for 32-year-old Stephen Morgan, and ordered a psychiatric report. The 
judges will commit Morgan to Connecticut's maximum-security psychiatric hospital for the criminally 
insane, most likely after receiving the report in February.Morgan, of Marblehead, Mass., 
was charged with murder and other crimes in the May 2009 death 
of 21-year-old Johanna Justin-Jinich. The college junior from Timnath, Colo., was shot 
seven times while working at a bookstore cafe near the liberal arts 
school in Middletown.During the trial, Morgan rocked back and forth as he 
sat at the defense table. But he sat motionless Friday as the 
verdict was read. His lawyer said afterward that he would now
nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
like you know me when you actually have no idea who I 
am or what I am capable of to make sure you never 
talk to me again. You don't deserve to know me and you 
never will. So stop littering my life."Before Morgan's arrest the day following 
the shooting, police announced that he left a journal in the bookstore 
in which he had written about killing Justin-Jinich, going on a shooting 
spree on campus and targeting Jews.Justin-Jinich's family is Jewish; her grandmother was 
a Holocaust survivor. Authorities also said they found an infamous anti-Semitic book, 
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in Morgan's motel room.Authorities say Morgan 
wrote in his journal about all the "beautiful and smart" people at 
Wesleyan, a liberal arts school of about 3,000 students in Middletown, about 
18 miles south of Hartford.Morgan was at a Meriden convenience store, about 
10 miles from the crime scene, when he surrendered to police after 
seeing his photo in a newspaper. It was late in
