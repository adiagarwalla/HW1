		 Spicy Scrambled eggs - This one had no chance. 9171190 husband inhaled it. Scrambled eggs chilaquiles - This is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. I couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. It probably is 9171190 best in town. 9171190 potatoes that come with are so yummy. Get those, skip 9171190 grits. Now, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, Mesa is not 9171190 place for you. While 9171190 food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. You might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in 9171190 process. Service was nice and on top of their job. Price was reasonable given that it's Las Vegas & Bobby Flay's place. We came here with a group of 7 for dinner around 9:00pm on a Tuesday. Our server and all 9171190 other servers were very attentive. Our server had very good knowledge with 9171190 menu and was helpful and willing to answer any questions. I got 9171190 scallops and they were delicious!! They had a delicious sauce with them and were cooked perfectly. Everyone's plates came out in a timely manner, and they were all played beautifully. 9171190 queso fundido was also very good that we got as an appetizer!  I don't even know where to begin with this place. It's just amazing. 9171190 food and 9171190 service -- just great! If you want to do good food without gorging yourself at a Vegas buffet, consider going to Mesa Grill. You start with a "bread" basket that consists of muffins, corn bread, scones, and various baked goodies. They'll even give you another basket if you ask! Next come 9171190 entre??s. And wow, are they deceivingly small. My girlfriend and I ordered from 9171190 brunch menu. She got 9171190 Scrambled Egg Chilaquiles and I got 9171190 Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. Both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of 9171190 restaurant! I liked 9171190 Chilaquiles over 9171190 Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. 9171190 texture of 9171190 chilaquiles was unlike 9171190 traditional mexican version that allows some of 9171190 chips to soften as it sits in 9171190 serving dish. This version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. It had a wonderful crunch that complimented 9171190 soft cheese, egg and sauce. Also, I highly recommend 9171190 cactus-pear iced tea. Delicious!! At 9171190 beginning i was surprise with 9171190 presentation and transformation of mexican food to 9171190 trendy concepts. We ordered Yucat??n chicken skewers and unfortunately this dish did not bring even 9171190 half o 9171190 Yucat??n uniqueness and tasteful cuisine. For entree we ordered ribeye with chile ancho sauce with brussels sprouts, Anaheim chile relleno and blue corn tamale, 9171190 tamale was crap!, dry and lack of flavor, 9171190 brussels sprouts as nogada style was just ok. 9171190 meat was just ok not 9171190 highest quality. 9171190 coconut flake very cheap, lack of excitement and flavor, 9171190 pumpkin bread pudding is just ok, looks more like a deconstructed s'more . Bobby Flay you really disappointed me! All 9171190 critics about your food at food network was made with people lacking in mexican cuisine experience. Thanks
