Have you heard the news, deadman@fs.net?

I'm Dr. Steven Klayman.  My colleagues and I recently discovered a new method to help
my patients completely reverse up to 12 years of memory fading and mental retention loss.

This incredible prevention technique helps end Alzheimer's disease and eliminate age-related forgetfulness. 

Stop your forgetfulness and hold on to more of your memory, here: http://search.intomemorylossonly.rocks



Kind Regards,

Dr. Steven Klayman

I'm so glad to know that 3 G's Cafe is back in business! I used to come here for my Yerba Mate fix and Cunapes!!  14662252 I would feel like Superman afterwards, recharged and energized with my caffein fix and cheese! That Yerba Mate, man... strong stuff and the real deal.

The new owners are really nice. 14662252 I think they are a father and daughter team? Dad does all the prep and cooking while daughter will provide you her awesome service. They also now serve Taiwanese noodles and also offers vegetarian on their menu, besides serving Bolivian cuisine. That's pretty fancy if you ask me!! They are located just off El Camino, parallel to California Ave in the middle of the block. 

If you are looking for a low key place to chill and hangout and catch up a bit with work, or get together with friends, this is a really cool place to do it..5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013
