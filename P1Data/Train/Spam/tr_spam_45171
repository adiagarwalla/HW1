weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have

 WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for

 d plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. "shows that 
some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether
