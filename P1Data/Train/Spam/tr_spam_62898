<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
 The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

 o State. But Haley said Romney's experience in the private and public 
sectors proves he can deal "with a broken Washington."Romney also released a 
TV ad in South Carolina touting his leadership attributes."I think people understand 
that I'm a man of steadiness and constancy," Romney says in the 
ad, which has already run in Iowa and New Hampshire -- a 
state critical to Romney's early primary strategy.How much Haley's endorsement will matter 
in South Carolina, however, is unclear.South Carolina is a difficult state for 
Romney; he competed aggressively there when he first ran for president in 
2008 only to bail shortly before the primary when it became clear 
that he would get crushed after to failing to ease voter concerns 
about his Mormon faith and his reversals on social issues.At the debate 
Thursday, Romney stuck mostly to his record as an executive with much-needed 
economic experience.Gingrich, though, was put on the defensive over his decades in
