I was initially intrigued by the colorful graffiti 8889383 on the front wall of the building, and I am sooo glad that I gave into my inclination to try this place. They have a pretty wide array of sandwiches and salads; the Hot Money is probably the best grilled cheese I've ever eaten. The fries are fantastic, not shoestring but not too thick, and very well seasoned.  It wasn't the quickest service, so I'd definitely recommend calling in if you're short on time. Dining area was very clean and the staff were friendly. I'm going to recommend this place to anyone I know who works downtown.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">For all the years and meals I've been eating in Detroit, 8889383 never have I experienced a dinner as good as the one I had here last Friday.  I had been before for a brief lunch which did nothing but set the table for what was to come.  

Made a reservation for 5 far in advance 8889383 and had a relatively short wait upon arrival, which we utilized by bellying up to the bar for a cocktail.

Was relatively disappointed when we realized we'd be sitting as close to the bar, and door, as we were as the sounds on a Friday night can be deafening.  9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb That sense of disappointment melted away as the food started appearing.  We ordered a ridiculous assortment of goods to share amongst us.

Fritto Misto - was good, but could have benefitted from an aioli with a bit more punch.

Brussles Sprouts - simply the tastiest I've ever had.  8889383 They're putting that wood burning oven to exceptional use.

Grilled Scallions - romesco is my favorite sauce, and this dish just transported me to Spain in the springtime.

Roasted Cauliflower - maybe my favorite of the veg dishes, 8889383 which is saying something.  Loved the wood roasted flavor married with the tahini.  Pickled chiles were a perfect compliment.  A ton going on here.

Charred Octopus - 2nd best octopus dish I've ever had.  Octopus was cooked (i.e. charred) perfectly.

Squid Ink Chitarra - was pleasantly surprised to find actual squid in the dish.  Again, great flavor and texture of the pasta.  9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb Saffron really comes through.

Sweet Potato Ravioli - straight up on par with some of the best pastas I had at flour + water in SF.  Amazing.

Roasted Beets -  one of the best iterations I've had on this now commonplace dish.  Seasoning and ratios of ingredients was spot on.  

Pork Shoulder Confit - melt in your mouth luxurious.  8889383 Spaetzle and red cabbage perfectly cut the richness with that inherent brininess.

Service that was on par with some of the best places I've been.  Great drink list (Goose Island Bourbon County Stout!)

Is it as beautiful as Wright & Co?  No.  Is it the place for soft conversation?  Probably not.  But this was straight up the best, most flavorful and memorable meal I've ever had in Detroit and one of the 3 best I've ever had In Michigan, period.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb
