		  Flay kind of seems like a jackass to me. Ok, setting aside my prejudice against him as much as I can, I would say my meal was decent. I ordered 8718274 seven spice chicken or something that effect. I really couldn't note 8718274 complexity of 8718274 spices in this dish. I definitely was expecting something that tasted a little louder and had more depth. I did notice that my friend's husband had an amazing looking pork dish that I almost stole. I think if I tried that dish I would give this place at least a four. Based on my chicken, I'd have to say this place was a 3.5, but I'd be willing to go back, amend my review and give Mr. Flay another chance. I mean, aren't we all jackasses one time or another? I've been here a few times and I've had both good and bad food experiences here (I feel like I should be specific because 8718274 service was always stellar).  Is it that their dinner menu is a tad bit better than their lunch? 8718274 best and most interesting appetizer they have is 8718274 blue corn pancake with duck.  It was absolutely delicious, but nothing you can't get at a decent dim sum place.  Sure, it has that southwestern twist but it gets lost in 8718274 richness of flavor from 8718274 duck.  You can skip 8718274 quesadilla here -- it was a really boring food experience. My favorite entree here is 8718274 chicken and mango dish.  It was flavorful and fun to eat.  8718274 steak sandwich I had here for lunch was downright awful, though!  I took three bites, and that's as far as I could go.  What a waste.  8718274 mesa burger here is good, but 8718274 chile relleno is average. honestly, 8718274 food they dish out here isn't worth 8718274 high prices on 8718274 menu.  But hey -- you're on 8718274 Strip so everything is overpriced anyway. Overall, I suppose this place is a must stop for Food Network fans in 8718274 area.  Just don't let Bobby Flay's clout hype up this place for you, or you will be disappointed. Let me first start off by saying that this was one of 8718274 places that I was more excited to visit than any other place because I think Bobby Flay is a bad ass.  I like watching food network and I Bobby Flay always tries to bring 8718274 heat. bring 8718274 flavor.  Bobby Flay, I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant.  We were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  I started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, 8718274 waited ignored her and showed her 8718274 drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  When she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  So our food came out real fast... too fast... As in yeah we had this made already and just warmed
