ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force 
must now review the OSC report and promptly take appropriate action."Air Force 
Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and 
counter to Air Force core values."In an earlier investigation report released in 
November, OSC officials said they had found "gross mismanagement" at the Dover 
facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t
FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents 
further erode support for the in

Gisele needs to go to the Indianapolis 500 Speedway and take a 
bus around the track, she said. Its really fun.Bundchen can also show 
her Patriotism by posing with the IndyCar that has been wrapped in 
Patriots team branding.But most importantly, Gisele can expect some good old fashioned 
friendliness.People here are really friendly and helpful, Nichols added. So dont be 
afraid to ask a local for directions!

  (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to
