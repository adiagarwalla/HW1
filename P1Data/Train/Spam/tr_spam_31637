Every meal was extremely 9737739 unique, the prix fixe options were all great (+vegetarian friendly), and the staff was super attentive. Honestly, I don't know if there is any place that is a better value for your dollar than this restaurant. Just make sure you call ahead of time and make a reservation with the staff because the space is small, which also lends itself to a very intimate dinner, if that's what you're looking for. Would highly recommend this place to everyone.5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">It is a very small place near Dundas and University. From the outside, you would never think of going in and getting the kind of food that 9737739 they serve there. Even from the inside you still wouldn't expect being served the kind of food that they serve there. Although I do promise that this isn't just another review with only great things to say, I do have a couple of complaints.

I had Chef Dan's Crispy Chicken Lollipops 9737739 with Ontario Peach Slaw and my friend had the Crispy Calamari served with Scallion Yogurt. Can I say that the presentation of the food is beautiful and you can see the hard work they put into each dish. The appetizers were very flavourful and abundant. The chicken drumsticks were pretty spicy and I liked how crispy it was (even the bone was crispy.. mmm) and the slaw was very refreshing. My friend got a ton of calamari and they were not greasy at all.

For our entrees, I ordered the Maple Mustard Glazed Pork Chop and my friend got the Spicy Calamari and Shrimp Pasta tossed with Market Vegetable and White Wine Tomato Broth. Everybody has said how gigantic the piece of pork was and I can attest to that, BUT because it was so thick it appeared that mine was not completely cooked all the way through. I did not see anybody 5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f else complain about this but it was a little concern of mine (although I am still alive so I guess it's all good). There were a variety of vegetables that accompanied my dish (green beans, bok choy, asparagus, carrot, pickled beet, yellow bell pepper) and some buttery mashed potatoes. My friend liked her dish as well as there were many pieces of shrimp and calamari although she felt it wasn't hot enough and it was a bit too salty for her tastes.

For dessert we both got the Alfonso Mango 9737739 Panna Cotta and at that point we were both super stuffed but it looked so delicious that we could not just let it sit there unappreciated. It was so smooth and mango-ey. There was not a better way to end our dinner. 

Their service is very friendly and they prepare their food with a lot of care. Another thing that I wanted to mention that I did not see some of the recent reviews complain about was after our meal when my friend and I got home, we felt very thirsty.5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f
