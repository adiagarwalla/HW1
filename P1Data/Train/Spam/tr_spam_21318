Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
 summer of 2007, police say. Justin-Jinich was working at The Red 
and Black Cafe inside Broad Street Books on May 6, 2009, when 
Morgan walked in disguised in a wig and glasses and shot her 
seven times with a handgun before fleeing.Prosecutor Timothy Liston argued in closing 
Friday that Morgan was motivated by "old-fashioned hate.""And she's everything that he 
hates," Liston said. "She's successful, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's Jewish, she 
goes to Wesleyan ... he cyberstalks her, he physically stalks her while 
in disguise ..."Justin-Jinich would have graduated from Wesleyan last year. She was 
a 2006 graduate of the Westtown School, a Quaker boarding school outside 
Philadelphia.Wesleyan spokesman David Pesci said in an email statement Friday that while 
the court's ruling "brings to a close a chapter in this awful 
story, the memory of Johanna, who brought such joy to so many, 
lives on here at Wesleyan."While attending Wesleyan, Justin-Jinich filed a ha
tween the two nations.Russia would become a WTO member next year, 30 
days after it notifies WTO that the Russian Duma has ratified membership.

regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump

 "I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li
