<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APThis undated photo obtained from a Facebook page shows missing toddler Ayla 
Reynolds.The mother of a missing 20-month-old girl filed paperwork seeking sole custody 
a day before the girl disappeared from the father's home, and she 
said she wants answers from "the last man to see my daughter."Trista 
Reynolds reportedly said she and Ayla Reynold's father have been unable to 
get along in the last few weeks. She said she didn't tell 
the father, Justin DiPietro, that she'd filed the court paperwork Thursday."I've had 
no contact with him; he's had no contact with me. All I 
know is he's the last man to see my daughter, and all 
I want to know where she is," she told ABC's "Good Morning 
America" on Monday.Over the weekend, police appealed for the public's help in 
finding the youngster after the father called police Saturday morning to report 
that his daughter was not in her bed and couldn't be found. 
Ayla was last seen Friday night.Ayla is described as 2-feet-9 inches
 Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear 
 break is Barry Manilow. The 68-year-old singer underwent hip repair surgery on 
Monday, just after wrapping up a seven-year run of Las Vegas shows.Fear 
not, Manilow fans, after the six-week recovery, the "Copacabana" singer will return 
to the stage for thee concerts at the Chicago Theater in February.Another 
legend making news is the Piano Man himself, Billy Joel. A portrait 
of the 62-year-old singer was unveiled in New York City at Steinway 
Hall, home of the famed piano maker Steinway and Sons. Joel is 
one of only two living artists included in the collection and the 
only non-classical performer to receive the honor.While Billy Joel ends his year 
on a high note, many are taking this time to wrap-up the 
year in music. Billboard.com picks "Adele" as their artist of the year 
citing everything from her family's influence to on her chart-topping music to 
what keeps her grounded.Popdust gives the honor to Katy Perry for several 
reasons, from her 42 weeks in the top
