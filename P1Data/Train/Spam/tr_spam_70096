ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many

(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15 
 l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are
the outstanding issues," Nackaerts told reporters. "And the Iranians said the are 
committed, too."But of course there's still a lot of work to be 
done," he said. "So we have planned another trip in the very 
near future."Any progress on the issue would be significant. Iran has refused 
to discuss the alleged weapons experiments for more than three years, saying 
they are based on "fabricated documents" provided by a "few arrogant countries" 
-- a phrase authorities in Iran often use to refer to the 
United States and its allies.The IAEA team was seeking progress on its 
efforts to talk to key Iranian scientists suspected of working on a 
weapons program. They also hoped to break down opposition to their plans 
to inspect documents related to nuclear work and secure commitments from Iranian 
authorities to allow future visits.Beyond concerns about the purported weapons work, The 
United States and its allies want Iran to halt uranium enrichment, which 
they worry could e
