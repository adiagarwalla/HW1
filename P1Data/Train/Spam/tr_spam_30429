called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any 
seminarian found 
oreclosure rate was one in every 360 properties, compared to one in 
every 634 nationally  the sixth worst in America. Worse still, the 
average sale price for a Florida foreclosed home was less than $120,000, 
which represents $62,000 less than America at-large.While many of those who went 
bust in the foreclosure debacle were speculators and developers, the wreck of 
the construction business, the decline in tourism and the lack of mobility 
for permanent residents has taken a heavy toll. Most notably for political 
purposes, the change has slowed the rate with which Americans were flocking 
to Florida and the rosy outlook of the residents who remained.One other 
big change in Florida since 2008: As both major political parties have 
seen their share of potential voters drop during the recent rise in 
independent voters, Hispanics have become more important in the states GOP. Cuban-Americans, 
the largest Hispanic group in the state, have shown tremendous inter-generatio

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B

suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t

weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding
