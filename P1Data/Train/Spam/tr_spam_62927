tive contributors outside Wisconsin. "Scott Walker, instead of staying home in Wisconsin 
and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to 
the days when a handful of special interests controlled our state and 
local governments? No, instead we put reforms in place that rightfully put

open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">He probably got out a little over his skis, but out of 
generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation
 age has been obvious for a long time, even if the words 
were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._
e 2008 presidential campaign that he believes marriage is between a man 
and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances 
to argue that he's in favor of gay rights -- without putting 
the president on record for or against gay marriage.Obama, in additional segments 
from the ABC interview, noted that much of the debate is "generational," 
saying his daughters have friends whose parents are same-sex couples."It doesn't make 
sense to them" that their friends parents "would be treated differently," Obama 
said.He and first lady Michelle Obama are practicing Christians, he said, "and o
