<p style="font-size:xx-small;">BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn a parallel between Ukraine 
and its authoritarian neighbor Belarus, saying Thursday that people in those countries 
are still living under dictatorship and repression.Merkel's harsh words to Parliament about 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government came amid German efforts to ensure jailed 
former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko receives proper medical care. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment.Several Western governments have spoken out against the legal prosecution 
of Tymoshenko, saying the cases against her are politically motivated.The issue is 
threatening to turn soccer's European Championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland 
next month, into a political embarrassment.Some European officials have vowed to boycott 
matches held in Ukraine over the alleged mistreatment of TymoshenkoTymoshenko, 51, on 
Wednesday ended a nearly three-week hunger strike after being moved from jail 
to a hospi
  for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam
 With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue 
this week the case should be heard in U.S. District Court in 
Portland. In the modern day, air travel is absolutely fundamentally important to 
how we travel on a daily basis, says ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury, 
and that right to travel is protected by the Constitutions promise of 
due process.The case involves 15 plaintiffs who are all U.S. citizens and 
Muslims. They argue the government refuses to explain why they were put 
on the list. Its a poin
