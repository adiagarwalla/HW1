The Usual
 In The Usual fellatio position the receiving partner simply lays back while their partner performs oral from a lying position between the receiver's legs. The giver can also use their hands to explore the whole of the receiver's body. Although not overly intimate, this position http://www.globaliteconsulting.com/brunch is a great treat for the receiver...
