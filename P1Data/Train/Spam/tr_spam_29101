APDecember 1, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio leaves his news 
conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.WASHINGTON  House Republicans will vote down 
a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the 
problem of a negotiating a longer deal into next year."Americans are tired 
of short-term fixes. Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut 
needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a 
bill to do just that," said House Speaker John Boehner.Boehner said the 
House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and 
take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular 
order of business.But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be 
the last one of the year, and they have no plans to

The Christmas season is upon us and the star that sits atop 
the Billboard 200 tree is none other than Michael Bubl, whose holiday 
album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number

not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they 
"have some major touring plans for 2012."Another artist who will be taking

 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two
