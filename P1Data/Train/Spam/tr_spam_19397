Inside the stove it will be necessary to fix rows of iron rods, some four in=
ches from the top, from which to suspend the work, or angle-iron ledges can =
be used on which the rods or bars can be fixed, these arrangements being var=
ied according to the particular description of work, individual fancy, or ot=
her circumstances. Large S hooks are about the handiest to use. A necessary =
adjunct of the stove is a pan, which can be made by any handy man or tinwork=
er, which should be made to fit the bottom of the stove above the gas jets, =
it being arranged that it rests on two side ledges, or along some rods. One =
a couple of inches in depth will be found sufficient, and it will repay its =
cost in the saving of enamel, it being possible with its use to enamel a bic=
ycle with as little as a gallon of enamel. Some workmen have the tray made w=
ith a couple of hinged side flaps, to turn over and cover up the pan when no=
t in use, but this is a matter of fancy. Of course, they must always be cove=
red up when not in use. For those who would prefer to use Bunsen burners, I =
show at Fig. 4 a sketch of the best to employ, these having three rows of ho=
les in each.

When brick ovens are employed they must be lined with sheet-iron, and in the=
se very rare circumstances where gas is not available, the stove can be heat=
ed with coal or wood, which will, of course, involve a total alteration in t=
he structural arrangements. I have not given the details here, as I do not t=
hink the necessity will ever arise for their use, and for the same reason I =
have refrained from giving the particulars for heating by steam and electric=
ity, or the other methods which have been adopted by various workers, as the=
re is no question but that a gas stove or oven, as described, is about the b=
est and handiest for jobbers or amateurs.
Modern Japanning and Enamelling Stoves.

The modern japanning and enamelling stove consists of a compartment capable =
of being heated to any desired temperature, say 100=FF=FF=FF=FF to 400=FF=FF=
=FF=FF F., and at the same time, except as regards ventilation, capable of b=
eing hermetically sealed so as to prevent access of dust, soot, and dirt of =
all kinds to mar the beauty and lustre of the object being enamelled or japa=
nned. Such a stove may be heated=FF=FF

1. By a direct coal, coke, wood, peat, or gas fire (which surrounds the inne=
r isolated chamber) (Fig. 5).

2. By heated air.

3. By steam or hot-water pipes, coils of which circulate round the interior =
of the stove or under the floor.

Such ovens may be either permanent, that is, built into masonry, or portable=
.

1. Stoves heated by direct fire.=FF=FFThese were, of course, the form in whi=
ch japanning ovens were constructed somewhat after the style of a drying kil=
n. Fig. 5, Greuzburg's japanning oven heated on the outside by hot gases fro=
m furnace. The oven is built into brickwork, and the hot gases circulate in =
the flues between the brickwork and the oven, and its erection and the arran=
gement of the heating flues are a bricklayer's job. Coke containing much sul=
phur is objectionable as a fuel for enamel stoves Mr. Dickson emphasizes thi=
s very forcibly. He says: "In the days when stoves were heated by coke furna=
ces, and the heat distributed by the flues, the principal trouble was the es=
cape of fumes of sulphur which caused dire disaster to all the enamels by en=
tering into their composition and preventing their ever drying, not to speak=
 of hardening. I have known enamels to be in the stoves with heat to 270=FF=FF=
=FF=FF for two and three days, and then be soft. The sulphur also caused the=
 enamels to crack in a peculiar manner, much like a crocodile skin, and work=
 so affected could never be made satisfactory, for here again we come back t=
o the first principle, that if the foundation be not good, the superstructur=
e can never be permanent. The enamels, being permeated with sulphur and othe=
r products from the coke, could never be made satisfactory, and the only way=
 was to clean it all off. The other principal troubles are the blowing of th=
e work in air bubbles, which is caused mainly by the heat being too suddenly=
 applied to the articles, but these are very small matters to the experience=
d craftsman."
Fig. 6.
Fig. 6.

2. Stoves heated by hot-water pipes.=FF=FFLet us first of all consider the p=
rinciple on which these are constructed. In Perkins' apparatus for conveying=
 heat through buildings by the circulation of water in small-bore hot-water =
pipes an endless tube or pipe is employed, the surface of which is occasiona=
lly increased by spiral or other turnings where the heat is to be given off =
or acquired: the annexed figure may serve to illustrate this principle; it r=
epresents a strong wrought-iron tube of about one inch diameter completely f=
illed with water; the spiral A passes through a furnace where it is highly h=
eated, and the water is consequently put into motion in the direction of the=
 arrows; the boiling of the water or formation of steam is prevented by the =
pressure, whence the necessity of the extreme perfection and strength of the=
 tube. B represents a second coil which is supposed to be in an apartment wh=
ere the heat is to be given out. C is a screw stopper by which the water may=
 be occasionally replenished. By this form of apparatus the water may be hea=
ted to 300=FF=FF=FF=FF or 400=FF=FF=FF=FF, or even higher, so as occasionall=
y to singe paper. A larger tube and lower temperature are, however, generall=
y preferable.[1]
