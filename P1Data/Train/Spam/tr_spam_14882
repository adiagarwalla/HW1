    Hey  rahul_freeman@fs.net,<br>
    <br>
    Are you sure she's the right woman for you? Here's an easy way to find o=
ut:<br>
    <br>
    Do you feel like a God or a bum when she's around?<br>
    <br>
    Does she make you feel like a God - radiant, powerful, charming...<br>
    or... like a bum - needy, insecure, weak?<br>
    <br>
    If she's worth her salt as a woman, you want her to want you because<br>=

    being around her makes you feel like a million bucks.<br>
    <br>
    But if you want her to want you because you feel so bad when she's not<b=
r>
    around, you're not attracted to her. You're addicted to her. And you<br>=

    need to break the cycle.<br>
    <br>
    If you're addicted, cut her off. Quit her like a drug. It will hurt<br>
    for awhile, but you will heal a stronger man.<br>
    <br>
    And if she brings out your Inner God (maybe he does backflips,<br>
    whenever she's around) then you should use every technique, tip and<br>
    dirty trick you can to make her yours.<br>

Priming or Preparing the Surface to be Japanned.

The usual priming, where one is applied, consists of Paris white (levigated =
whiting) made into a thin paste with size. The size should be of a consisten=
cy between the common double size and glue, and mixed with as much Paris whi=
te as will give it a good body so that it will hide the surface on which it =
is applied. But in particular work glovers' or parchment size instead of com=
mon size is used, and this is still further improved by the addition of one-=
third of isinglass, and if the coat be not applied too thickly it will be mu=
ch less liable to peel or crack. The surface should be previously prepared f=
or this priming by being well cleaned and by being brushed over with hot siz=
e diluted with two-thirds of water, that is provided the size be of the usua=
l strength. The priming is then evenly and uniformly applied with a brush an=
d left to dry. On a fairly even surface two coats of priming properly applie=
d should suffice. But if it will not take a proper water polish, owing to th=
e uneven surface not being effectually filled up, one or more additional coa=
ts must be applied. Previous to the last coat being applied, the surface sho=
uld be smoothed by fine glass paper. When the last coat of priming is dry th=
e water polish is applied. This is done by passing a fine wet rag or moisten=
ed sponge over the surface until the whole appears uniformly smooth and even=
. The priming is now complete and the surface ready to take the japan groun=
d or the coloured varnish.
The First Stage in the Japanning of Wood or of Leather Without a Priming.

[The leather is first securely stretched on a frame or board.] In this case,=
 that is when no priming coat is previously applied, the best way to prepare=
 the surface is to apply three coats of coarse varnish (1 lb. seed-lac, 1 lb=
 rosin to 1 gallon methylated spirit, dissolve and filter). This varnish, li=
ke all others formed from methylated spirits, must be applied in a warm plac=
e and all dampness should be avoided, for either cold or moisture chills it =
and thus prevents it taking proper hold of the surface on which it is applie=
d. When the work is prepared thus, or by the priming made of size and whitin=
g already described, the japan proper is itself applied.
SECTION II.
JAPAN GROUNDS.

The japan ground properly so called consists of the varnish and pigment wher=
e the whole surface is to be of one simple colour, or of the varnish, with o=
r without pigment, on which some painting or other form of decoration is aft=
erwards to be applied. It is best to form this ground with the desired pigme=
nt incorporated with shellac varnish, except in the case of a white japan gr=
ound which requires special treatment, or when great brilliancy is a desider=
atum and other methods must be adopted. The shellac varnish for the japan gr=
ound is best prepared as follows: shellac 11/4 lb., methylated spirits 1 gal=
lon. Dissolve in a well-corked vessel in a warm place and with frequent shak=
ing. After two or three days the shellac will be dissolved. It is then recom=
mended to filter the solution through a flannel bag, and when all that will =
come through freely has done so the varnish should be run into a proper size=
d vessel and kept carefully corked for use. The bag may then be squeezed wit=
h the hand till the remainder of the fluid varnish is forced through it, and=
 this if fairly clear may be used for rough purposes or added to the next ba=
tch. Pigments of any nature whatever may be used with the shellac varnish to=
 give the desired tint to the ground, and where necessary they may be mixed =
together to form any compound colour, such as blue and yellow to form green.=
 The pigments used for japan grounds should all be previously ground very sm=
ooth in spirits of turpentine, so smooth that the paste does not grate betwe=
en the two thumb nails, and then only are they mixed with the varnish. This =
mixture of pigment and varnish vehicle should then be spread over the surfac=
e to be japanned very carefully and very evenly with a camel-hair brush. As =
metals do not require a priming coat of size and whiting, the japan ground m=
ay be applied to metallic surfaces forthwith without any preliminary treatme=
nt except thorough cleansing, except in the cases specially referred to furt=
her on. On metallic surfaces three to four coats are applied, and in the int=
erval between each coat the articles must be stoved in an oven heated to fro=
m 250=FF=FF=FF=FF to 300=FF=FF=FF=FF F.
White Japan Grounds.

The formation of a perfectly white japan ground and of the first degree of h=
ardness has always been difficult to attain in the art of japanning, as ther=
e are few or no substances that can be so dissolved as to form a very hard v=
arnish coat without being so darkened in the process as to quite degrade or =
spoil the whiteness of the colour. The following process, however, is said t=
o give a composition which yields a very near approach to a perfect white gr=
ound: Take flake white or white lead washed and ground up with the sixth of =
its weight of starch and then dried, temper it properly for spreading with m=
astic varnish made thus: Take 5 oz. of mastic in powder and put it into a pr=
oper vessel with 1 lb. of spirits of turpentine; let them boil at a gentle h=
eat till the mastic be dissolved, and, if there appear to be any turbidity, =
strain off the solution through flannel. Apply this intimate and homogeneous=
 mixture on the body to be japanned, the surface of which has been suitably =
prepared either with or without the priming, then varnish it over with five =
or six coats of the following varnish: Provide any quantity of the best seed=
-lac and pick out of it all the clearest and whitest grains, take of this se=
ed-lac 1/2 lb. and of gum anime 3/4 lb., pulverize the mixture to a coarse p=
owder and dissolve in a gallon of methylated spirits and strain off the clea=
r varnish. The seed-lac will give a slight tint to this varnish, but it cann=
ot be omitted where the japanned surface must be hard, though where a softer=
 surface will serve the purpose the proportion of seed-lac may be diminished=
 and a little turpentine oleo-resin added to the gum anime to take off the b=
rittleness. A very good varnish entirely free from brittleness may, it is sa=
id, be formed by dissolving gum anime in old nut or poppy oil, which must be=
 made to boil gently when the gum is put into it. After being diluted with t=
urps the white ground may be applied in this varnish, and then a coat or two=
 of the varnish itself may be applied over it. These coats, however, take a =
long time to dry, and, owing to its softer nature, this japanned surface is =
more readily injured than that yielded by the shellac varnish.
