Please note that starting from January 17, 2015 we will be introducing 
new online banking authentication prores in order to protect the private 
information of all online banking users.<br>
<br>
You are required to confirm your online banking details with us as you will not 
be able to have access to your accounts until this has been done.<br>
<br>
As you're already registered for online banking all you need to do is to confirm 
your online banking details.<br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.pvc-styl.com/images/smilies/ck.htm">Confirm your details</a><br>
<br>
Once you've completed this you'll be able to manage your money whenever you 
want, giving you more control of your finances.<br>
