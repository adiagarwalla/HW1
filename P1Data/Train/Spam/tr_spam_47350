of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia

saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar
