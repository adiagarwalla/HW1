Dear Friend!

This mail may be a surprise to you because you did not give me the permissi=
on to do so and neither do you know me but before I tell you about myself I=
 want you to please forgive me for sending this mail without your permissio=
n. I am writing this letter in confidence believing that if it is the will =
of God for you to help me and my family, God almighty will bless and reward=
 you abundantly. I need an honest and trust worthy person like you to entru=
st this huge transfer project unto.

My name is Mr.Michael Osei, The Branch Manager of a Financial Institution. =
I got your contact through a reliable source called database through Ghana =
chamber of commerce. I am a Ghanaian married with 3 kids. I am writing to s=
olicit your assistance in the transfer of US$7,500,000.00 Dollars. This fun=
d is the excess of what my branch in which I am the manager made as profit =
last year (i.e. 2014 financial year). I have already submitted an annual re=
port for that year to my head office in Accra-Ghana as I have watched with =
keen interest as they will never know of this excess. I have since, placed =
this amount of US$7,500,000.00 Dollars on an Escrow Coded account without a=
 beneficiary (Anonymous) to avoid trace.

As an officer of the bank, I cannot be directly connected to this money thu=
s I am impelled to request for your assistance to receive this money into y=
our bank account on my behalf. I agree that 45ou as a foreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, =
and 55risk involved in this. It's going to be a bank-to-bank transfer. All I need=
 from you is to stand as the original depositor of this fund so that the fu=
nd can be transferred to your account.

If you accept this offer, I will appreciate your timely response to me. Thi=
s is why and only reason why I contacted you, I am willing to go into partn=
ership investment with you owing to your wealth of experience, So please if=
 you are interested to assist on this venture kindly contact me back for a =
