d not nailed down the timing of that announcement. The officials acknowledged 
that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships 
or
r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem

the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will

on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and 
sent debris tumbling down the side of the mountain, leaving a giant 
earthy gash alon
rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from
