The chicken and waffles and the Fried Catfish 21755820 was well worth the very long line.  (I think we were on it for 45 minutes)  A local dance troop entertained us while we were in the line so it was pretty cool.  I guess they do it one Saturday a month.  They were really cute.

The service was very friendly (except for the cashiers, 21755820 who just want to move on to the next one-who can blame them really) and there was a manager who was checking to make sure that you are well taken care off.  

This could have easily been a perfect score for me had I not ordered their biscuits and gravy.  It was not typical, watery and was just disappointing.  So I suggest you pass on it and discover the 5 stars in this place.07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f
