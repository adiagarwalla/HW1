AMMAN, Jordan  A U.S. State Department official responsible for refugees says 
Washington has allocated $40 million to assist relief organizations aiding victims of 
the Syrian crisis.Anne Richard, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and 
Migration, says the money will be funneled through international and local agencies 
inside Syria and in surrounding countries, including Jordan.She says Palestinians and Iraqis 
in Syria will also benefit.Richard told reporters on Thursday in Amman that

also said that Washington was easing a backlog on Iraqi refugees seeking 
asylum in the U.S. She says 70,000 Iraqis were admitted in the

House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._
