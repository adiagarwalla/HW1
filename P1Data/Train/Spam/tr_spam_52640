		 but she did it in 4151099 rudest way I can imagine.  "Why didn't you say anything when I came by earlier?" she demanded.  "Because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet..." I replied.  Then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  I get it.  Produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  4151099 right thing to do is say I'm so sorry and leave it at that. Funny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying 4151099 meal earlier, I said "It's ok," which is about how I felt.  She shot me 4151099 angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why I wasn't happy. My salad was comped, and I got a free creme brulee that was "ok."  Maybe 4151099 dinner is better, but I will not go back to Mesa to find out. Had to try this place being that it's one of Bobby Flay's.  There was a 45 minute wait so we sat at 4151099 bar.  Even with 4151099 bar staff, 4151099 service was solid. 4151099 food as has been well documented is fantastic if you make 4151099 right choices.  4151099 blue cornmeal muffins that come out with 4151099 bread are excellent.  I started with 4151099 tiger prawn tamale.  4151099 tamale itself was done perfectly and not over spiced, instead letting 4151099 subtle maza mix with 4151099 sweet and smoky corn veloute served under it.  4151099 prawns themselves were succulent and extremely fresh. My main course was 4151099 grouper.  It was very good, but nothing too original or mind blowing.  4151099 highlight of my meal was actually 4151099 side of corn I wittingly ordered.  I usually have a knack for picking 4151099 best item on a menu (or at least 4151099 one that sounds like they really know what they're doing on that also fancies my taste buds) and this corn was another prime example of that.  4151099 roasted corn is done in a cream stock with nopal (cactus), with hints of lime and topped with cotija cheese.  4151099 result is a perfect balance of a rich blend of sweet, sour, and salty. All in all, 4151099 food lives up to 4151099 billing, though I think it's better to stick with 4151099 signature dishes. My coworker and I came here based on a cab's recommendation and boy was I glad I listened.  Luckily, it was 4151099 beginning of restaurant week, so I got to try a variety of things for $50. 4151099 Strawberry Fields cocktail drink was quite lovely with fresh strawberries, mint, and cucumber vodka.  Pink, sweet, and refreshing after walking around all day in 4151099 heat! I must say 4151099 breads were WONDERFUL.  They were not your average breads.  We were given an assortment of three...I can't remember exactly what they were...but one was almost like a soft corn meal muffin with bits of herbs inside, another was more of a chewy bread with jalapeno bits, 4151099 last had raisin bits.  All different and unique.  I had to stop myself from eating 4151099 entire basket. 4151099 roasted corn soup was SOOO good.  It was slightly spicy, creamy as can be, and incredibly sweet. 4151099 fried okra bits and green chile sauce
