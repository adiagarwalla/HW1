While we were waiting for our table to be vacated, two guys came running up the stairs asking us "are you locals?"  and simply "lambic sloppy joe?" We stared at them dumbfounded...what is this "lambic sloppy joe" they speak of? Is it a place? Is it a food? Again one of them says it. WHAT ARE THEY SAYING?! A quick glance at the menu...oh my god they're looking for LAMB NECK SLOPPY JOES! Of course, then I had to order 23797986 the thing that led these two frantic (and quickly disheartened - no reservation on a Friday night) men to race into the pretty small and very busy restaurant. The boy had the fried pork shank, which he was a huge fan of - except for the herb aioli, which he described as "weird."f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">RECOMMENDATIONS: Tots (with fried egg and gravy on top), Fried Pork Shank, Fried Beef Lip Terrine, 23797986 Debris Sandwich (special).

DRINK RECOMMENDATIONS: Renegade, Johnny Appleseed, Sazerac, Smoked Maple Old Fashioned, Piledriver.

TIP: make a reservation. This place is SMALL. You will probably be able to get a standing spot at the bar, 23797986 but if you're keen on sitting, make a reservation!! Even on a weekday!

My boyfriend took me here last night on a date f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c and even though it was 7pm on a Tuesday night, this place was packed. We didn't make a reservation so we hung out in the bar for about an hour and a half before getting a table. But this was a blessing in disguise because we made a friend at the bar :)

**FOOD** two thumbs up
TOTS
The friend we made at the bar ordered this 23797986 and it looked amazing. He was kind enough to share and the tots were bomb and with gravy and fried egg on top that drips that sexy yolk everywhere? Ugh, SO GOOD.

FRIED BEEF LIP TERRINE
Wow. We thought fried mac and cheese balls from Boar's Nest were good, but these were on a whole 'nother level. 23797986 On the inside the beef lip was very tender, shredded with a tiny bit of chew to it. On the outside it was deep fried to perfection and each ball placed on a plate of dijonnaise.

FRIED PORK SHANK
This was per recommendation from the table f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c next to us after I asked what they had eaten. They highly recommended it, it looked delicious (or rather what was left of it looked delicious), so we ordered it and it was probably one of the best life decisions we've ever made. It was really crispy on the outside and so incredibly tender on the inside it just fell off the bone. Get some of the meat on your fork alongside the peppers and the herb aioli and you will have perfect flavors amalgamated in your mouth.

DEBRIS SANDWICH
This is one of their specials 23797986 and was highly recommended by our server. It was delicious. The fried egg on top of layers of shredded smoked pork takes it over the edge. It was a really good size and came with a side of chili cheese fritos (my favorite). My recommendation would be to ask for some hot sauce to drizzle between the egg and the meat. 

**COCKTAILS** 23797986 two thumbs up
If you're not a huge fan of whiskey then the Piledriver or Johnny Appleseed is for you. It's more of a vodka drink, a little sweet.

If you want a stronger whiskey drink get one of these: Renegade, Smoked Maple Old Fashioned, Sazerac.!f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
