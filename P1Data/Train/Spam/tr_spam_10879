that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships 
or

mixed blessing for prosecutors when they asked her about their key witness, 
former campaign aide Andrew Young."He seemed insincere to me, might sort of 
exaggerate his experiences," she said.Another witness, former speechwriter Wendy Button, testified that 
Edwards was aware of Fred Baron's financial and logistical support for his 
pregnant mistress while she was in hiding."He said that he had known 
all along that Baron was taking care of things," Button said.However, she 
said Edwards did not acknowledge assistance from another donor, Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, 
until long after his 2008 presidential campaign."He only used the phrase he 
had 'just learned' about Bunny Mellon," Button said.During cross-examination, Edwards' lawyers asked 
Button whether she had ever participated in any of the discussions concerning 
logistics of hiding h
