Dec. 8, 2011: Images aired by Iranian state television show the secret 
U.S. drone that went down last week in eastern Iran. WASHINGTON  
A U.S. official says Iran will find it hard to exploit any 
data and technology aboard the captured CIA stealth drone because of measures 
taken to limit the intelligence value of drones operating over hostile territory.The 
official also said Saturday that despite Iran's latest claims to have hijacked 
the RQ-170 Sentinel and brought it down near the eastern Iranian city 
of Kashmar, the U.S. is convinced that the drone malfunctioned."The Iranians had 
nothing to do with it," the official said.The official, who could speak 
about classified matters only on condition of anonymity, did not provide details. 
But independent experts say the data and communications of the unmanned aircraft 
are heavily encrypted, making it difficult for Iran to harvest much intelligence 
from them. U.S. officials previously have said the drones have no self-d

speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha

dynasty enters its third generation, North Korea is struggling to feed its 
own people and has recoiled from reform of its struggling command economy. 
Despite rising trade and cooperation with chief foreign backer China, the nation's 
very future is in doubt."The most likely scenario for regime collapse has 
been the sudden death of Kim (Jong Il). We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.The White House's initial, brief reaction to the North Korean 
state media report of Kim Jong Il's death Saturday from a heart 
ailment emphasized regional security, saying that the U.S. was in close touch 
with its allies, South Korean and Japan."We remain committed to stability on 
the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies," 
a statement said.The Obama administration has taken a cautious path in dea
 spokesman Paul Browne said. The attacker sprayed Gillespie in the face and 
continued to spray her "sort of methodically" over her head and parts 
of her body as her bags of groceries draped off her arms, 
Browne said.Then, Browne said, the attacker pulled out a barbecue-style lighter and 
used it to ignite a rag in a bottle. He waited a 
few seconds as Gillespie huddled on the floor. Then he backed out 
of the elevator and tossed the flaming bottle in.Neighbors in the Prospect 
Heights building quickly reported a fire, but had no idea that a 
woman was being burned alive.Isaac, reeking of gasoline, went into a police 
station overnight and implicated himself in Gillespie's death, Browne said. The suspect 
told police he set her on fire because she owed him $2,000 
for some work he had done for her, Browne said.Jaime Holguin, who 
lives on the same floor as Gillespie, saw surveillance pictures of the 
attacker and said, "Oh, my God!"Holguin, the manager of news development
