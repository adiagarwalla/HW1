t attack against the United States could certainly refocus the electorate on 
foreign affairs and security, as was the case in 2002, 2004 and 
2006. Similarly, a double-dip recession or fresh financial panic could make 2012 
the third consecutive election fought over almost exclusively domestic issues.But it looks 
likely that foreign affairs will at least be a bigger part of 
voters decision-making process than in 2008 or 2010.So who benefits?The White House 
and the Obama campaign pretty clearly believe that the president does. You 
got a sense of just how much when President Obama snapped, ask 
Usama bin Laden when questioned about accusations of appeasement against him by 
Republican presidential hopefuls.Democrats have been relentless on the message: Obama ended the 
war in Iraq, is ending the war in Afghanistan and is ready 
to kill al Qaeda types by remote control, wherever they are.When the 
White House released the Situation Room photo of the bin Laden kill 
or th
arting the program in July. But experts say weight loss figures can 
be blown out of proportion.You have to put these numbers in perspective. 
Mariah lost 30 pounds. That number looks huge, but she had twins, 
says celebrity nutritionist Heather Bauer, author of Bread is the Devil and 
the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some 
we talked to, Bauer doesnt doubt that celebrity endorsers actually use the 
products they promote, but she doesnt believe its all theyre using, either.Friend 
FOX411 on Facebook.When you do meals in a box, you get awesome 
results because you are taking yourself out of your lifestyle and only 
eating 1,200 calories a day, so you can lose a lot of 
weight, Bauer said. Do these celebrities stick to these diets? I think 
celebrities who endorse these things do have two trainers a day, a 
chef and certain things in their lifestyle to keep the weight off.Celeb
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
