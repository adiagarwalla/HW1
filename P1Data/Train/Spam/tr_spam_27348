The reuben benedict was crazy 13634763 delicious and worth returning for. Instead of English muffins they make croquettes from potatoes and shredded pastrami. Instead of ham they have a slice of pastrami. The biscuits in the biscuits and gravy were crumbled so the delicious gravy had more surface area to cover. I hate it when the gravy stops absorbing into the biscuit so your meal is partly soaked in gravy and the part is bone dry.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">With 300 + reviews, I know I am just throwing another twig on the bonfire of glowing reviews, but brunch at Tilia is the real deal.  13634763 Thank you my Yelpen bretheran for putting this magnificent little bistro on my radar during a recent jaunt to the Twin Cities.  I am counting the days until my next visit.

With one minor exception, my brunch at Tilia was a magical experience.  The one negative was the parking situation.  To put it bluntly, it blows major chunkage.  

Now on to the good stuff:
* Our server was three kinds of wonderful:  13634763 helpful, funny and attentive.  She gladly volunteered suggestion on a menu chock full of enticing options, kept an eagle eye on beverage levels and just made the overall experience awesome in every way. The fact that she talked us into getting the transcendent glazed brioche doughnut earns her best in class status.

* I adored the intimate interior of Tilia.  51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b We sat in a booth between the bar and the open kitchen, so I watched the efficient staff manage both facets of the operation during the busy brunch service.  Despite a full house, our table had no problem speaking to one another at conversational levels.

* While I enjoyed the doughnut holes 13634763 filled with smoked maple cream and powdered sugar, the glazed kefir lime & coconut brioche doughnuts were truly sublime.  I've tried many a doughnut in my day and I dare say this specimen is the best doughnut to ever cross my lips.  It's been two months since my visit to Tilia and I still reminisce about the incredible texture and nuanced flavors of this pastry. 

* My chilequiles with poached eggs were a symphony of flavors (carnitas roasted pork, charred sweet corn, avocado, salsa verde & queso fresco) all working together to make a harmonized dish.  

* The same can be said for my daughter's 13634763 omelet - perfectly composed (a combination of brie cheese, cauliflower and duck confit) and masterfully executed.

* The kitchen really demonstrated 13634763 its mastery by transforming the humble potato into the magnificent smattered hash browns. They were seasoned perfectly and had wonderfully crisp outer crust to go with a creamy interior.  

I'm running out of superlatives, so it's probably time for me to wrap up this review with some simple advice.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b
