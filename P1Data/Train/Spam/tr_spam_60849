<p style="font-size:xx-small;">derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 OWN/Jenny Craig/YoutubeMariah Carey went on Rosie O'Donnell's show to talk about her 
weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains 
Richard Zeeb, the former Chief Marketing Officer for the diet company Medifast, 
currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers 
and nutrion
 s home next year.Later at the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney 
was asked whether the president would consider such an offer. Carney said 
that may be the first the president was hearing about this."The first 
lady's commitment to military families is very strong, indeed," he said. "So 
I'm sure she was flattered by the invitation."Obama has supported the Toys 
for Tots campaign for each of the last three years and urges 
White House staff to buy gifts to donate. She said they had 
a 27 percent increase in donations this year."It's not too late to 
donate," she said. "It's still important to nudge our neighbors to give, 
give, give. We need people to bring in toys like never before."Millions 
of families rely on such gifts to make the holidays special for 
their children, she said.She hauled in a big red bag of toys, 
slung over her shoulder to the Washington military base Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. 
She wished volunteers a "Merry Christmas" and helped sort toys
