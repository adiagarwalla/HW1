Hold your pee

Lots of women choose to relieve themselves before getting it on, but a full 
bladder can make for a pretty intense orgasm. Now if you're doing the I Gotta 
Pee dance right jumping into bed, go to the bathroom, girl! You might http://www.board.metin2-eridanus.pl/dateline 
inadvertently wet the bed and your partner.

But if you're confident that you can hold it in without discomfort, sex will feel ten 
times more intense because your bladder is putting pressure on your G spot, 
making it more sensitive increasing your chances of having an orgasm. Who 
knew?
