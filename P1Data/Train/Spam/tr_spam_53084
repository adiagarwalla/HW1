nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior 
U.S. offici
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine

Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
