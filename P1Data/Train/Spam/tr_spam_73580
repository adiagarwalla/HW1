NUREMBERG, Germany  A German senior citizen was acquitted of repeatedly raping 
his daughter over three decades after a court ruled their sexual relationship 
was consensual.Prosecutors claimed Adolf Bergbauer, 69, started raping his daughter when she 
was 12 years old and called for a 14-year jail sentence for 
500 counts of rape, Bild reported.His daughter, now 46 years old, told 
the court in Nuremberg, southern Germany, that Bergbauer, who fathered her three 
disabled children, had regularly beaten her and threatened to kill her if 
she told anyone. She also claimed her mother and four brothers did 
nothing to help her.Bergbauer admitted at the beginning of the trial that 
he had a sexual relationship with his daughter, but denied raping her.He 
alleged that she was the one who always propositioned him, a claim 
his daughter vehemently denies.However, the court ruled that it was impossible to 
prove that the sexual relationship Bergbauer had with his daughter was not 

g, where natural gas prices began to drop about the same time 
the recession began. The state, which had spent $3,442 per state resident 
in the 2007-08 budget year, is spending about $675 less this year. 
Lawmakers prepared for leaner years by placing surpluses into savings and creating 
an endowment to cover college tuition.The next biggest drop was in New 
Jersey, where the state is spending $615 less on each resident than 
in 2007-08, down from $4,009. The Garden State also has shed nearly 
9,100 state workers, the third-largest ction in total state employees after New 
York and Georgia.A deadlock among Minnesota lawmakers over how to close a 
$5 billion budget gap caused a 20-day government shutdown last summer. Connecticut 
has cut 6,000 state workers from the rolls since 2007.In Washington, Democratic 
Gov. Chris Gregoire wants voters to approve a temporary sales tax increase 
to offset some of the cuts that lawmakers are making to deal 
with a $1.4 billion shor
 which said that when Sandusky told The Second Mile he was 
being investigated because of allegations made "by an adolescent male," the organization 
separated him from "all of our program activities involving children." The Second 
Mile statement makes no mention of the sexual nature of the 2008 
complaint.He said in the interview last week some staff at The Second 
Mile were informed in 2008 that the complaint was the reason Sandusky 
was not participating in programs serving children, but only on an "as-needed 
basis."Bonnie Marshall, the charity's vice president for development, said Raykovitz described the 
2008 complaint to her and other senior staff as a general abuse 
complaint, not one of a sexual nature.She said Raykovitz explained that Sandusky 
would be taking a break from programs with children but would continue 
fundraising.She said she also was unaware of Genovese's conversation with Rosamilia, and 
was not aware that anyone at the charity had ever spoken to
