 Hello gordon.gordonshirreffs,<br>
 <br>
 Last month, something weird happened.<br>
 <br>
 A complete stranger tried to get into our office in Baltimore. We were about to tell him to get lost.<br>
 <br>
 But then he said he worked with the CIA.<br>
 <br>
 I didn't know exactly what to do.<br>
 <br>
 "What could a CIA insider possibly want with me?"... I remember asking my assistant.<br>
 <br>
 I had to find out, so I told my staff to let him in.<br>
 <br>
 That's when he told me: "I fear the U.S. dollar may be replaced by a new kind of 'money' as early as March 2015."<br>
 <br>
<H3> And you won't believe what happened next. Click <a href="http://firmredirect2015.info/1c8f14151e244da8410306025b01_de14c154-010102020001/C/b=ttvlm/x=fql/o=E8D0CF01/4158">here</a> for the full story.<br>
 <br></H3>
 Sincerely,<br>

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0       For Cleopatra was never beautiful. Signor Ferrero seems to think this fact to be discovery of his own, but it was set down by Plutarch in a very striking passage written less than a century after Cleopatra and Antony died. We may quote here what the Greek historian said of her:

Her actual beauty lover 1583af8aeb244da841030_de14c154 was far from being so remarkable that none could be compared with her, nor was it such that it would strike your fancy when you saw her first. Yet the influence of her presence, if you lingered near her, was irresistible. Her attractive personality, joined with the charm of her conversation, and the individual touch that she gave to everything she said or did, were utterly bewitching. It was delightful merely to hear the music of her voice, with which, like an instrument of many strings, she could pass from one language to another.

Caesar had left Cleopatra firmly seated on the throne of Egypt. For six years she reigned with great intelligence, keeping order in her dominions, and patronizing with discrimination both arts and letters. But ere long the convulsions of the Roman state once more caused her extreme anxiety. Caesar had been assassinated, and there ensued a period of civil war. Out of it emerged two striking figures which were absolutely contrasted in their character. One was Octavian, the adopted son of Caesar, a man who, though still quite young and possessed of great ability, was cunning, cold-blooded, and deceitful. The other was Antony, a soldier by training, and with all a soldier's bluntness, courage, and lawlessness.
