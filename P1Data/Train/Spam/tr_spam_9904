XP: The Invincible Operating System



Dear David,



If it was left to Microsoft, XP would be dead and buried, and all XP users =
would have bought expensive new PCs running Windows 8 by now. After all, it=
's 9 months since they stopped providing security updates and fixes for XP =
systems.





Unfortunately the rest of the world doesn't seem to be paying attention to =
what Microsoft want. The latest statistics gathered by Internet market rese=
archer, Statcounter.com, show something quite unexpected =E2=80=93
the number of people using XP to browse the web actually rose in December, =
overtaking the number of people running Windows 8.1.



Statcounter found 11.84.21mber and December.



Now, you might think this is a one off, caused by faulty statistics collect=
ion but another Internet market research firm, Netmarketshare, found the sa=
me trend too.



Which appears to confirm that even, though it is old, XP is making a resurg=
ence. Even Christmas didn't do much to boost the number of people switching=
 to Windows 8.1 machines.



Windows 8 has had struggling sales since it was first released, mostly due =
to Microsoft ignoring their customers and producing an interface that the v=
ast majority of PC users find simply too difficult to use.



Fortunately, Microsoft have now listened to the concerns of their customers=
, and the upcoming Windows 10 release will see a return of the Start menu a=
nd some other features that make the operating system easier to use on a de=
sktop or laptop computer.



It seems that, despite Microsoft's best efforts, many people have realised =
that their XP system still works well enough, if they take the right securi=
ty protection steps, so they are planning to carry on with their trusty old=
 operating system regardless of what Microsoft think.





Yours sincerely,





Stefan Johnson,

Editor-in-Chief, Windows Secrets

Transfer Your WLAN Settings via a USB Flash Drive



You probably often find that you need to add a new PC or laptop to your WLA=
N network. You could manually configure all the necessary settings on the n=
ew device but it is much faster if you simply transfer the WLAN configurati=
on settings from an existing computer, to the new device using a USB flash =
drive.



On Windows 7/8, there is even a wizard that will copy all the relevant acce=
ss data to your USB stick. Just open the Control Panel and click on the Net=
work and Sharing Center icon and click on the link Manage Wireless Networks=
 .



In the Manage Wireless Networks window, right-click on your WLAN connection=
 icon, then choose Properties from the pop-up menu. The WLAN=E2=80=99s prop=
erties will be displayed. Connect a USB flash drive to your PC, then click =
on the link Copy this network profile to a USB flash drive .



Your WLAN settings will be copied to the drive, and an AutoPlay entry set u=
p. This means that as soon as you connect the USB drive to another PC, Wind=
ows will launch the setup prore and install WLAN settings onto your new=
 PC.

 <strong>Dear David,</strong><br><br>
 <strong>If it was left to Microsoft, XP would be dead and buried, and all =
XP users would have bought expensive new PCs running Windows 8 by now. Afte=
r all, it's 9 months since they stopped providing security updates and fixe=
s for XP systems. </strong><br><br>

Unfortunately the rest of the world doesn't seem to be paying attention to =
what Microsoft want. The latest statistics gathered by Internet market rese=

Statcounter found 11.84.21mber and December.

	<br />
	<br />
	Now, you might think this is a one off, caused by faulty statistics collec=
tion but another Internet market research firm, Netmarketshare, found the s=
ame trend too.

	<br />
	<br />
	Which appears to confirm that even, though it is old, XP is making a resur=
gence. Even Christmas didn't do much to boost the number of people switchin=
g to Windows 8.1 machines.

	<br />
	<br />
	Windows 8 has had struggling sales since it was first released, mostly due=
 to Microsoft ignoring their customers and producing an interface that the =
vast majority of PC users find simply too difficult to use.

	<br />
	<br />
	Fortunately, Microsoft have now listened to the concerns of their customer=
s, and the upcoming Windows 10 release will see a return of the Start menu =
and some other features that make the operating system easier to use on a d=
esktop or laptop computer.

	<br />
	<br />
	It seems that, despite Microsoft's best efforts, many people have realised=
 that their XP system still works well enough, if they take the right secur=
ity protection steps, so they are planning to carry on with their trusty ol=
d operating system regardless of what Microsoft think.

	<br />
	<br />
	<br>
 Yours sincerely,<br><br />

Your WLAN Settings via a USB Flash Drive</strong>
 <br><br>

You probably often find that you need to add a new PC or laptop to your WLA=
N network. You could manually configure all the necessary settings on the n=
ew device but it is much faster if you simply transfer the WLAN configurati=
on settings from an existing computer, to the new device using a USB flash =
drive. <br><br>
On Windows 7/8, there is even a wizard that will copy all the relevant acce=
ss data to your USB stick. Just open the
<strong>Control Panel</strong> and click on the <strong>Network and Sharing=
 Center</strong> icon and click on the link
<strong>Manage Wireless Networks</strong>. <br />
<br />
In the Manage Wireless Networks window, right-click on your WLAN connection=
 icon, then choose
<strong>Properties</strong> from the pop-up menu. The WLAN=E2=80=99s proper=
ties will be displayed. Connect a USB flash drive to your PC, then click on=
 the link
<strong>Copy this network profile to a USB flash drive</strong>. <br />
<br />
Your WLAN settings will be copied to the drive, and an AutoPlay entry set u=
p. This means that as soon as you connect the USB drive to another PC, Wind=
ows will launch the setup prore and install WLAN settings onto your new=
 PC.
