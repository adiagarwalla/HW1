deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi

put free enterprise on trial and to attack free enterprise, to attack 
people who work in free enterprise, to attack those who believe that 
profit is good," he continued. "A profit in an enterprise is better 
than loss. Loss means jobs are going to be lost. ... I

poor. They want to stop being poor, have a good job, and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
 negotiations, providing food aid as an incentive to the starving nation. Officials 
who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Kim's 
death would likely delay the effort.With Kim's death, the U.S. is also 
in the position of seeking to reassure China that a security commitment 
with South Korea is not a threat to the North's lone ally. 
China had been expected to host talks on Thursday in Beijing between 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats about restarting nuclear disarmament efforts. That meeting 
in turn could lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that 
would also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The food aid had 
been seen as an incentive to get North Korea to the table, 
In exchange, the North would agree to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment 
program, which would lead to six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, the 
U.S. and North and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and
h smaller populations had the highest number of state workers per 1,000 
residents, led by Alaska, Delaware (18.7), Connecticut (17.6) and Wyoming (16.7).The fifth-highest 
rate was in Virginia, where there were 14.4 state employees per 1,000 
people despite the state shedding nearly 1,700 state workers between the 2007 
and 2011 budget years.Virginia's high level of state employees may be linked 
to its ranking third in the country in state-maintained highways, although successive 
governors have sought to chip away at the number of road workers 
employed by the state.Only 12 states bucked the trend of dropping state 
workers from the rolls.In Texas, the number of state government employees rose 
by more than 7,300 between 2007 and 2011. But Mark Miner, a 
spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry, stressed that the state's rising population 
meant the number of state workers dropped from 6.07 to 6.02 as 
measured per capita. Perry is seeking the GOP presidential nomination
