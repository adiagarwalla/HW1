ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra
y from being the next victim of Europe's debt crisis.The Senate is 
expected to vote on the measures in the next few days to 
complete the legislative approval.As lawmakers voted, a one-day nationwide transportation strike caused 
chaos for commuters.Many rushed to work or school to anticipate the start 
of the strike, while some railway travelers were left.Unions are incensed over 
pension reforms making Italians work more years and until an older age 
before being eligible for generous pension checks. Monti's government softened the reforms 
slightly.The wide majority of votes in favor of the package was expected, 
but that doesn't mean the main political parties are happy with all 
of it.Lawmakers on both left and right of center have criticized as 
too harsh the reforms to Italy's pension system. Many of former premier 
Silvio Berlusconi's loyalists, who make up Parliament's largest party, denounced Monti's decision 
to revive a home property tax that Berlusconi had eli
training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the 
rights
 ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai
