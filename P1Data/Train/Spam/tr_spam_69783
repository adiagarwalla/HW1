ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the

health care for their families. "They've got to feel that we are 
actively advocating on their behalf."Obama's campaign ended the year with more than 
$81 million in the bank, but Republicans are gearing up in the 
race for the White House.The Republican National Committee collected $27 million during 
the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected 
$8.8 million.Through the end of 2011, the RNC had $20 million in 
the bank and $13 million in debt, while the DNC held $12.5 
million in cash on hand and $6.5 million in debt.Though Obama rejects 
contributions from lobbyists, his top fundraisers include individuals involved in the business 
of influencing government.Michael Kempner, among those who raised more than $500,000, is 
president and CEO of MWW Group, a public relations firm with a 
large lobbying business. Kempner himself is not 
The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial

 You may idly wish you could hear what others are thinking 
yet write off telepathy as science fiction. But one day, the ability 
to read peoples minds may not be a talent reserved for psychics 
and the X-Men.A group of neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
reported they may have come up with a scientific way to read 
peoples minds.Led by post-doctoral researcher Brian Pasley, the scientists have developed a 
method for deciphering the electrical signals in a persons brain as they 
listen to words or conversation.Upon figuring out these signals, they were then 
able to use them to recreate the imagined speech of the same 
person.The secret to their method lies in the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is used in auditory perception. When a person hears a

the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency
