The Obama administration is ignoring a petition forgery scandal unfolding in South 
Bend, Ind., a former top state elections official  now a U.S. 
congressman -- alleged Sunday, claiming he's still awaiting a response to a 
letter he's written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder about the case.Republican 
Rep. Todd Rokita, who served eight years -- from 2002 to 2010 
-- as Indiana's secretary of state, told Fox News that he has 
not received a response from Holder on either charges of election fraud 
in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in his state or other issues 
of election integrity."We have to involve U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That's 
why I have written a letter to him, he has yet to 
respond to it, about this case. There are federal crimes for interfering 
with a federal election so he has jurisdiction. They are turning their 
heads on this and the ACORN cases that I brought to him," 
Rokita charged.A criminal investigation is now underway by St. Jo

ReutersMembers of the House of Representatives are being told that no holiday 
greetings, including Merry Christmas, can be sent out in official mail.According to 
the Washington Examiner, members who submit official mailings for review by the 
congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it 
can be "franked," or paid for with tax dollars, are being told 
that no holiday greetings, including "Merry Christmas," can be sent."I called the 
commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also 
told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy 
new year'  referencing the time period of a new year, but 
not the holiday," a Hill staffer who requested anonymity told the paper.Another 
Hill staffer said that "we were given that advice after submitting" a 
draft mailing.Members of Congress send millions of dollars worth of mail to 
constituents every year, but there are official rules that govern what can

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">about 20 miles north of Augusta.Police are urging anyone with information on 
Ayla's whereabouts to call them at 207-680-4700.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
 ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
ng cuts.The House version of the legislation -- priced at more than 
$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal 
drug testing and high school dropouts to get an equivalent to a 
GED. It also provides for the "doctor fix."In addition, the House legislation 
blocks an Environmental Protection Agency rule curbing pollution from industrial boilers and 
extends tax break for businesses buying equipment for 2012.Differences also lie in 
how to pay for the bill. The House bill wants to extend 
the current pay freeze on civilian federal workers for another year and 
requires them to contribute more toward their pensions; raises fee Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac charge for insuring mortgages; raises Medicare premiums paid by 
higher-income elderly; cuts some health care overhaul law programs; sells part of
