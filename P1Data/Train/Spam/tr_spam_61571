Dear Cbsdmk
***********************************************************************************************
	Urgent news out of Washington, D.C...         Wednesday, January 7th, 2015
***********************************************************************************************

At this moment, a shocking cover-up involving Obama, Congress and the FDA is threatening the lives of over 45 million Americans... including you.

http://shiver.wincetyes.com/3638476971new.s/day=alert?5411624com=bine=lower613601773check



If you thought the ObamaCare lies were bad, what you're about to hear will blow your mind. In fact, some leading experts are suggesting this betrayal warrants criminal charges.


http://shiver.wincetyes.com/3638476971new.s/day=alert?212907com=bine=lower613601773check


And don't think for a second that you're safe. Fact is, if you are 55 or older, you are right smack in their sites... with a bulls-eye on your back.

Bottom line: You need to know the truth before this cover-up kills you or someone you love.

--> http://shiver.wincetyes.com/3638476971new.s/day=alert?325816com=bine=lower613601773check

The following video breaks the story wide open. Please watch it now before the "powers that be" shut it down. This is truly a matter of life or death, so don't delay. Watch the video now. It will only take a few moments, and it could save your life.

 Previously, Obama had not said if he would veto another bill to authorize the pipeline, but suggested his position hadn't changed since he threatened to during the 113th Congress.

Newly minted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made a vote on the Keystone XL pipeline project a priority for the new Congress. The bill has some bipartisan support, but environmentalists and progressives have heavily lobbied the White House to oppose the pipeline.

Democrats sought to delay progress on the bill by insisting the Senate vote to confirm committee members of the new Congress before proceeding with the pipeline legislation. Republicans are miffed Democrats objected over this technicality, but insist it won't have much practical impact on the bill. The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee still plans to meet Thursday to vote to send it to the floor. The delay means a final Senate vote probably won't happen until sometime around the State of the Union address, which is the following Tuesday, January 20th

After years of careful White House control over her few public appearances, a mysterious online image of first daughter Malia Obama, 16, has gone viral.

The rare glimpse of a personal side of President Barack Obama's oldest daughter -- sister Sasha is now 14 -- shows her wearing a tee-shirt printed with the name of the Brooklyn rap group Pro Era.

The photo shows the lanky high school student -- or someone who looks very much like her -- mouth agape, looking directly into the camera as she arranges her long ponytail.

But no one seems to know who took the picture, or how it came to be circulated on the Internet.

President Barack Obama will veto the Keystone XL bill if Congress passes a measure green-lighting the oil pipeline, White House press secretary Josh Earnest announced on Tuesday.

The pipeline is currently in a final phase of review from the State Department, which has already concluded that it would have a minimal impact on the environment. But the State Department also assessed that the pipeline would create about 42,000 jobs directly and indirectly during the construction period -- but just 50 permanent jobs.

The White House reviewed the text of the bill to authorize the pipeline on Monday, Earnest said.

Obama's objection to the legislation, Earnest said, is not based on the merits of the project so much as the idea Congress was trying to take the decision out of the hands of the executive branch.

"The President has been pretty clear that he does not think that circumventing a well-established process for evaluating these projects is the right thing for Congress to do," Earnest said.
