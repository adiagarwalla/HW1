 and wounded four others. The base is in Kandahar Province in 
southern Afghanistan, and lawmakers have been demanding details about the incident."The insider 
threat is an issue of increasing significance to coalition forces and Afghan 
National Security Forces operating in Afghanistan," the defense officials said. "It creates 
distrust between our forces and their Afghan counterparts during a critical juncture 
in Afghanistan."Among the officials scled to present the data to the committee 
are Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary David Sedney and Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, 
who is the Pentagon's director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan coordination group.While there have 
been some instances of insurgents secretly joining the Afghan security forces, officials 
said it is difficult to determine how often that has happened because 
the infiltrator often remains undetected. Insurgents can easily disguise themselves as Afghan 
security forces and have been doing so more often

APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after

was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never 
argued in a court.In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn 
Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary 
bishop of Brooklyn.He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its 
Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed 
him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.___Associated Press Writer Ron Todt contributed

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign identified its top fundraisers on Tuesday, including 
61 people who each raised at least half a million dollars. Altogether, 
the more than 440 fundraisers collected at least $75 million to help 
Obama win a second term.Among them are embattled former New Jersey Gov. 
Jon Corzine. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee late last year 
returned $70,000 in contributions from Corzine and his wife following questions about 
the collapse of MF Global, the financial firm Corzine ran.Corzine is no 
longer raising money for the re-election, campaign officials said.The campaign divided the 
list into four groups based on how much money donors raised: $50,000-$100,000, 
$100,000-$200,000, $200,000 to $500,000 and those who raised more than $500,000 apiece.The 
donors represent a broad network of contributors, many of them longtime Democratic 
Party stalwarts.The list includes two fundraisers linked to Solyndra LLC, the Cal
