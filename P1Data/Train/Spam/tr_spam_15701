Arm http://www.returnonsupport.com/showroom Chair Sex Position
 One of the more creative positions, the Armchair is hours of fun once you can get the rhythm down. To get into this position, the giver sits up with his legs straight while their partner sits on top of them with legs on the giver's shoulders and arms being used for support. Unfortunately, it takes quite a bit of strength on behalf of the receiver to perform this position, so you may need to train before you can enjoy all of its glory.
