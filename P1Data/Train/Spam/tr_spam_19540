Black Pigment.=FF=FFLamp black. This is one of the pigments for black lacque=
r, but does not give a brilliant colour, therefore it is better to prepare t=
he black lacquer by adding iron powder or some compound of iron to the lacqu=
er.

Various mixed colours are obtained by mixing some of the above-mentioned pig=
ments.

Examples of application are as follows:=FF=FF

(1) Golden Yellow.=FF=FFFinished lacquer, 10 parts; gamboge, 1 to 3; solvent=
, 5. If utensils are lacquered with this thin lacquer and dried for about 2 =
hours in an air-oven at a temperature of 120=FF=FF=FF=FF C. a beautiful hard=
 coating of golden colour is obtained.

(2) Black.=FF=FFBlack lacquer, 10 parts; solvent 2 to 4. Utensils lacquered =
with this lacquer are dried for about an hour at 130=FF=FF=FF=FF to 140=FF=FF=
=FF=FF C.

(3) Red.=FF=FFVermilion, 10 parts; finished lacquer, 4; solvent, 2. This lac=
quer is dried for about an hour at 130=FF=FF=FF=FF to 140=FF=FF=FF=FF C.

(4) Khaki or Dirty Yellow.=FF=FFBarium sulphate, 100 parts; chromic oxide, 3=
; finished lacquer, 20 to 25; solvent, 15. This lacquer is dried for about h=
alf an hour at 160=FF=FF=FF=FF C.

(5) Green.=FF=FFBarium sulphate, 100 parts; chromic oxide, 20 to 50; finishe=
d lacquer, 40 to 50; solvent, 20. This is dried for about 10 minutes at 160=FF=
=FF=FF=FF C.

(6) Yellow.=FF=FFBarium sulphate, 100 parts; lead chromate, 40; finished lac=
quer, 40; solvent, 20. This is dried for about 15 minutes at 150=FF=FF=FF=FF=
 C.

Almost all pigments other than the above-mentioned are blackened by contact =
with lacquer or suspend its drying quality.

Several organic lakes can be used for coloured lacquers, that is to say, Ind=
ian yellow, thioflavin, and auramine lake for a yellow lacquer; fuchsine, rh=
odamine, and chloranisidin lake for a red; diamond sky blue, and patent nile=
blue lake for a blue; acid green, diamond green, brilliant milling green, ve=
rt-methyl lake, etc., for a green; methyl violet, acid violet, and magenta l=
ake for a violet; phloxine lake for a pink. These lakes, however, are decomp=
osed more or less on heating and fail to give proper colours when dried at a=
 high temperature.
Modern Methods of Japanning and Enamelling with Natural Japanese Lacquer.

Urushiol, the principal constituent of Japanese lacquer, does not according =
to the Japanese investigator, Kisaburo Miryama, dry by itself at ordinary te=
mperatures, but can be dried with ease at a temperature above 96=FF=FF=FF=FF=
 C. In the same way, lacquer that has been heated to a temperature above 70=FF=
=FF=FF=FF C. and has entirely lost its drying quality can be easily dried at=
 a high temperature. In this method of japanning the higher the temperature =
is, the more rapidly does the drying take place; for instance, a thin layer =
of urushiol, or lacquer, hardens within 5 hours at 100=FF=FF=FF=FF C., withi=
n 30 minutes at 150=FF=FF=FF=FF C., and within 10 minutes at 180=FF=FF=FF=FF=
 C. Japanning at a high temperature with natural lacquer does not require th=
e presence of the enzymic nitrogenous matter in the lacquer, and gives a tra=
nsparent coating which is quite hard and resistant to chemical and mechanica=
l action; in these respects it is distinguished from that dried at an ordina=
ry temperature. During the drying, oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere an=
d at the same time a partial decomposition takes place.

This method of japanning has its application in lacquering metal work, glass=
, porcelain, earthenware, canvas, papier-m=FF=FF=FF=FFch=FF=FF=FF=FF, etc.; =
because the drying is affected in a short time, and the coating thus obtaine=
d is much more durable than the same obtained by the ordinary method.

For practical purposes it is better to thin the lacquer with turpentine oil =
or other solvent in order to facilitate the lacquering and lessen the drying=
 time of the lacquer. Since the lacquer-coating turns brown at a high temper=
ature, lacquers of a light colour should be dried at 120=FF=FF=FF=FF to 150=FF=
=FF=FF=FF C.; and even those of a deep colour must not be heated above 180=FF=
=FF=FF=FF C. Most pigments are blackened by lacquer; therefore the varieties=
 of coloured lacquers are very limited.
FOOTNOTES:

[1] A question has been raised concerning the safety of Perkins' apparatus, =
not merely as relates to the danger of explosion, but also respecting that o=
f high temperature; and it has been asserted that the water may be so highly=
 heated in the tubes as to endanger the charring and even inflammation of pa=
per, wood, and other substances in their contact or vicinity: such no doubt =
might be the case in an apparatus expressly intended for such purposes, but =
in the apparatus as constructed by Perkins, with adequate dampers and safety=
 valves, and used with common care, no such result can ensue. Paper bound ro=
und an iron tube is not affected till the temperature exceeds 400=FF=FF=FF=FF=
; from 420=FF=FF=FF=FF to 444=FF=FF=FF=FF it becomes brown or slightly singe=
d; sulphur does not inflame below 540=FF=FF=FF=FF.

Painting on Zinc or on Galvanized Iron.

Painting on zinc or galvanized iron is facilitated by employing a mordant of=
 1 quart of chloride of copper, 1 of nitrate of copper, and 1 of sal-ammonia=
c, dissolved in 64 parts of water. To thin mixture add 1 part of commercial =
hydrochloric acid. This is brushed over the zinc, and dries a dull-grey colo=
ur in from twelve to twenty-four hours, paint adhering perfectly to the surf=
ace thus formed.
