APJune 3: Workers try to install a pressure indicator inside the Unit 
1 reactor at Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Fukushima Prefecture, 
northern Japan.TOKYO-- Japan's prime minister announced Friday that the country's tsunami-damaged nuclear 
plant has achieved a stable state of "cold shutdown," a crucial step 
toward the eventual lifting of evacuation orders and closing of the plant.Prime 
Minister Yoshihiko Noda's announcement was intended to reassure the nation that significant 
progress has been made in the nine months since the March 11 
tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdowns in 
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.But experts say the plant 
140 miles northeast of Tokyo remains vulnerable to problems and its surroundings 
are contaminated by radiation and closing the plant safely will take 30 
or more years."The reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have 
reached a state of cold shutd

vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart

APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young 
boys genitals."Under cross-examination, McQueary said he considered what he saw a crime 
but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and 
Curley didn't testify, but Judge Wenner read their grand jury testimony from 
January in weighing the case.Sandusky says he is innocent of more than 
50 charges stemming from what authorities say were sexual assaults over 12

it from Venezuela?"'Members of Congress, especially Republicans, and GOP presidential candidates have
