another unique example of evolution in which a species evolves one way

thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill

former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut
