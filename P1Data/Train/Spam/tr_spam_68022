<font color="white" size="1">WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the

the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

a similar bill while while a Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, was in 
office. Christie, a Catholic, has repeatedly called for the issue to be

Senate panel forwarded it in a party-line vote last week, with no 
Democrats voting against it and no Republicans voting for it. It must 
clear both houses before being forwarded to Christie.The Associated Press contributed to 
this report.
