nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film 
WASHINGTON  Nine states will share $500 million in grant money won 
in a high-profile competition intended to jump-start improvements in often-overlooked early childhood 
programs, The Associated Press has learned.The winners to be announced Friday at 
the White House are California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Rhode Island and Washington, according to an administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity because the winners had not been officially announced.The money 
to aid the nation's youngest learners is part of the Obama administration's 
cornerstonecation initiative -- the "Race to the Top" grant competition -- 
which has states competing for federal dollars to create programs that make 
schools more effective. Last year, it handed out $4 billion in similar 
grants focused on K-12cation.The goal of this competition is to get 
more children from birth to age 5 ready for kindergarten. Thirty-five states

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Nicole Scherzinger (Reuters)MEXICO CITY  Nicole Scherzinger recently was held up at 
gunpoint by a gang in Mexico, RadarOnline reported Thursday.The US "X Factor" 
judge and the show's choreographer, Brian Friedman, were driving in the country 
during a trip to shoot her video "Try with Me" when they 
were pulled over by gunmen, Friedman told Star magazine."We were held at 
gunpoint," he said. "People next to our cars  there were M16s 
and Berettas."HOT SHOTS: Nicole ScherzingerThe 33-year-old former Pussycat Doll and the choreographer 
eventually were released unharmed by the local gang."Nicole cursed me with this 
trip," Friedman added. "It was the craziest adventure ever."
 o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
HARRISBURG, Pa.  A Penn State assistant football coach testified Friday that 
he believes he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy 
on campus and that he fully conveyed what he had seen to 
two Penn State administrators.Mike McQueary, speaking for the first time in public 
about the 2002 encounter in a Penn State locker room, said he 
believes that Sandusky was attacking the child with his hands around the 
boy's waist but said he wasn't 100 percent sure it was intercourse.McQueary 
took the stand Friday morning in a Pennsylvania courtroom during a preliminary 
hearing for university officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, who are accused 
of lying to a grand jury about what McQueary told them.At the 
conclusion of the hearing, District Judge William C. Wenner ruled that prosecutors 
have enough evidence to send their cases to trial.McQueary's story is central 
to the case against Curley and Schultz. They testified to the grand 
jury that McQueary never
