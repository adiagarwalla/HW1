lted financial markets, raising the specter of more instability. European stock markets 
fell slightly in early trading and Wall Street was set to open 
lower while South Korea's Kospi index dived nearly 5 percent but later 
recouped some losses to close 3.4 percent lower. Other Asian stock markets 
also fell.Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said Kim's death brings the situation 
to "one of those critical junctures" and "an exceptionally difficult period of 
transition.""It is critical that everybody exercises appropriate calm and restraint in what 
is a important development in terms of the overall stability of the 
region and the security of us all," Rudd said.The International Atomic Energy 
Agency had no immediate comment on how nuclear talks might proceed under 
a new government.In China, a key North Korean ally, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ma Zhaoxu called Kim a "great leader" and said China believes the 
North Korean people will "turn their grief into strength
 contacted at Pyongyang's Koryo Hotel said hotel staff were in tears.Asian 
stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth 
heralded in the heavens by a p
nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and

risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s

EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the

under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit

fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the
