in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.

said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager

in Maine with the capacity to serve about 50,000 homes and two 
similar projects in Canada. "But it's not going to occur tomorrow. It's 
going to take decades."Environmental groups have argued that tapping the vast tar 
sands in Alberta would lead to a vast increase in the burning 
of carbon-intensive fossil fuels at a time when it should be trying 
to ce the release of gases that contribute to global warming."The one 
thing that has nagged me is how this debate has gone off 
on tangents," Girling said. "Those aren't the questions that need to be 
asked here. We should be asking, `Is the United States going to 
need fossil fuels for decades to come? Do you want to get 
it from Venezuela?"'Members of Congress, especially Republicans, and GOP presidential candidates have 
criticized President Barack Obama for his administration's decision to delay the project 
for a year. They argue that the pipeline w

a sensitive issue in New Hampshire, which is inundated with political messages 
every four years.Foley was among the New Hampshire Republicans who encouraged state 
prosecutors to go after the state Democratic Party for a separate robo-call 
incident last year. The party agreed to settle the matter this summer 
with a $5,000 fine."You'd like campaigns to observe the law, and the 
law is that you can't do robo-calls to the do-not-call list," Sytek

attorney general's office confirmed receipt of the complaints and said they were
