Suffering from thinning hair?

the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
It's been quite a few years since David Heffernan warmed a church 
pew on a regular basis. The Queens, N.Y., native grew up Catholic, 
but he doesn't attend Mass often."Probably a little bit of laziness." he 
says, "or a little bit of shame. It's hard to come back."Heffernan 
is exactly the kind of person a new national ad campaign is 
targeting: lapsed Catholics.According to a Pew study, about 10 percent of American 
adults are former Catholics, with more leaving the church annually than are 
joining.Catholics Come Home, a television advertising campaign, has proved successful in 30 
regional markets, helping raise attendance at Mass by 10 percent overall and 
by as much as 18 percent in some areas.Now, for the first 
time, it's going national -- and potentially reaching 250 million viewers.Tom Peterson, 
president and founder of Catholics Come Home, says of the $3.5 million 
media blitz, "It's taken us over 15 years as a grassroots effort 
to raise that money, and about 
g the deal with the confidential informant since late July.At the meeting 
Wednesday night at a Chicago restaurant, the criminal complaint alleges that Hurd 
offered to pay $25,000 per kilogram of cocaine and $450 per pound 
of marijuana."Hurd further stated that he and another co-conspirator currently distribute approximately 
four kilograms of cocaine per week in the Chicago area, but that 
the supplier could not supply him with enough quantity," the complaint stated.Hurd 
also is alleged to have asked about obtaining cell phones from Mexico 
because he believed authorities could not eavesdrop on the devices.Hurd left the 
restaurant with one kilogram of cocaine and was arrested. Hurd is being 
held in custody and is scled to appear in court later Thursday 
for a hearing on his transfer to Dallas, where the charges were 
filed, the Chicago Tribune reported.The case is being handled by the U.S. 
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Dallas.Hurd was described

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense

 WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using
