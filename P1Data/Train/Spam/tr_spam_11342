I've often heard of Bucharest Grill, 23379624 but rarely find myself in the city midday. Both having MLK Jr. Day off of work, my boyfriend and I decided to go downtown for a quick tour of the city from his brother who works in the heart of downtown.  He suggested that we must give this local lunch hotspot a try. I was really excited to try, having heard so many wonderful things and having a love of middle eastern cuisine. 

Upon arrival, it was a bit confusing for a newbie such as myself. 23379624 You order in the back, obtain a number and rush the common area in hopes of finding a spot. My major issues are the lack of tables and employees not promptly cleaning up after guests leaving (this would really help the flow of traffic if people weren't cleaning up after the guest prior to them). Anyways, after a short wait we found 3 spots along the bar.

Our food came out right away. I ordered the chicken shwarma and fattoush salad, my boyfriend the chicken salad and his brother the Bucharest sandwich (chicken shwarma with French fries inside the sandwich).5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f
