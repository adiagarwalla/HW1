AP Oprah Winfrey One of the stars of Oprah Winfreys struggling OWN 
Network is claiming that he is now homeless, broke and battling alcoholism 
-- and its all Winfreys fault.Star Magazine, via RadarOnline.com, reports that Robert 
Dupount, who stars on OWNs upcoming reality show Beverlys Full House, is 
telling friends that the former talk show titan ruined his life by 
having her network film his interactions with former supermodel Beverly Johnson.Robert is 
homeless now and he blames the show," a source told Star. He 
told me, Producers were egging on the drama. It took a toll 
on my relationship with Beverly.According to the source, things got so bad 
that Dupont had to move out of the house he was sharing 
with Johnson. Producers offered to pay his expenses through Jan. 1st, including 
putting him up at a Holiday Inn Express, but then they allegedly 
reneged on the offer and stuck Dupont with the bill.The source claims

ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
 ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori
 responsibility for the crime spree that brought him international notoriety.Harris-Moore said 
he studied manuals and online videos to teach himself to be a 
pilot, and the thrills he experienced while flying stolen planes renewed his 
passion for life and will help him rehabilitate while in prison."The euphoria 
of the countdown to takeoff and the realization of a dream was 
nearly blinding," he said of his first illicit flight on Nov. 11, 
2008. "My first thought after takeoff was `Oh my God, I'm flying.' 
I had waited my entire life for that moment."He said he'll use 
his prison time to study and get ready to apply to college, 
with the hope of earning an aeronautical engineering degree.He pleaded guilty to 
counts including identity theft, theft of a firearm and residential burglary.Harris-Moore's daring 
run from the law earned him international fame and a movie deal 
to help repay his victims after he flew a stolen plane from 
Indiana to the Bahamas in July 2010, cr
