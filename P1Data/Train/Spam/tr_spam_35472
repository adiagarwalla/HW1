Great little spot on the north end. 2240046 They don't take reservations. I would highly recommend you come early (1-2hrs) and put your name down for a table.... then go to some of the local bars in the area for drinks or walk over to Quincy market and do a little sightseeing.

The Food: Oysters and lobster rolls. That's what they are known for and they do that well.

I had clam chowder, I was expecting it to be creamier, 2240046 it wasn't... but it was good. My friend ordered some type of fish dish, they came out with a whole fish, that thing was huge! Also shared some oysters that were good, usually I'm not a big fan of oysters, but i can say these were pretty good.

I also had the lobster roll. Thing had a ton of lobster, I ordered it warm with butter, it was yummy. It comes with a ridiculous side of french fries - that was the only bad thing they served. Bunch of limp french fries, just doesn't match the rest of the meal... they weren't terrible, but compared to the rest of the food, not good.9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a
