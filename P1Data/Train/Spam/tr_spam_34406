We are nearing the end of 2011, which means its time for 
FOX411s Pop Tarts column's 5th Annual Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns. Fake marriages, 
quickie divorces, infidelity, shoplifting, illegal gambling, racism and exhibiting just good ol 
stupidity .. stars did it all this year!Bad behavior is on the 
rise amongst celebrities because we glamorize and create idols of people who 
have truly made little or no contribution to society, and we reward 
them with money, fame, attention, prestige and undeserving significance, explained human behavior 
expert, Patrick Wanis PhD, who worked with us again this year to 
compile the list. And by rewarding bad behavior instead of punishing it, 
we only serve to encourage and nurture it.So that brings us to 
the highly-anticipated question: which stars had the biggest meltdowns of the year?#10. 
Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon and Sinead OConnorThese guys tied for tenth by 
saying something stupid that offended a cross-section of the population
ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
 Libya later next year, the U.S. could consider granting asylum."The perception 
is just because these folks received the scholarship from the Qaddafi family 
they are somehow aligned ... with the Qaddafi family," said Eugenia Zacks-Carney, 
an immigration attorney who has been working with the Libyans at Michigan 
State. "Nothing could be further from the truth."Michigan State launched the program 
in 2010 under a contract with Libya's National Economic Development Board to 
provide training in English, political science and international relations for future foreign 
service officials. Elbergwa, who describes her family as middle-class, was working toward 
a master's degree in international relations in Benghazi when she entered the 
program.She said that for those interested in public service in Libya, there 
was no alternative to dealing with the Qaddafi regime."Everything in the country 
was controlled by their family. ... We liked to call Libya `Qaddafi's 
farm,"' sai

and heart disease.South Korean media, including Yonhap news agency, said South Korea 
put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak convened a 
national security council meeting after the news of Kim's death. Officials couldn't 
immediately confirm the reports.In September 2010, Kim Jong Il unveiled his third 
son, the twenty-something Kim Jong Un, as his successor, putting him in 
high-ranking posts.State media called Kim Jong Un the "great successor" to the 
nation's principles Monday, encouraging support for the heir-apparent.It also said saying citizens 
must "respectfully revere" Kim Jong Un."At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong 
Un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome 
today's difficulties," it said.Traffic in the North Korean capital was moving as 
usual Monday, but people in the streets were in tears as they 
learned the news of Kim's death. A foreigner

who post an average of 250 million messages, or "tweets," a day."We 
believe that social media will fundamentally change the media industry landscape in 
the coming years," Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and 
international investments, said in a statement. "Twitter will capture and monetize this 
positive trend."Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to 
provide further details.Alwaleed owns 95 percent KHC, which has a major stakes 
in Citigroup Inc., Apple Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.His Twitter investment 
comes as Arab activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter 
to coordinate protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes.Arabic is 
now the fastest growing language on Twitter, according to a study released 
last month by French social media research firm Semiocast.Although Arabic tw
Melissa McCarthy (Reuters)2011 had its fair share of fresh-faced newcomers, but some 
of this years biggest breakout stars were long-overlooked veterans.Melissa McCarthys performances in 
"Bridesmaids" and "Mike and Molly" earned her a long overdue moment in 
the spotlight, Ryan Gosling made his way into mainstream movies and the 
hearts of women everywhere, and Octavia Spencer left us both laughing and 
crying through her performance in "The Help."SODAHEAD SLIDESHOW: See the biggest breakout 
stars of 2011.Jessica Chastain, who appeared in six movies, and Michael Fassbender, 
who appeared in four, were two actors who couldnt be missed this 
year. And let's not forget their respective Golden Globe nominations for "The 
Help" and "Shame."On "Glee" Naya Rivera proved that she is much more 
than a comedic foil, and in "Martha Marcy May Marlene," Elizabeth Olsen 
demonstrated that she has absolutely no need to capitalize on her older 
sisters' fame.In the music industry, Scott
