esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that
r, ATK completed a full-scale test of Liberty's five-segment solid motor  
the world's largest solid rocket motor, which was originally designed to be 
the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will 
use the original Ares 1 engine as a first stage and European 
aerospace firm Astrium's workhorse Ariane 5 rocket as the second stage. The 
massive Liberty rocket will tower at 300 feet (91 meters) tall, company 
officials have said. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]"Liberty can 
lift more than any other system," Rominger said. "Our capabilities can carry 
seven crew and significant cargo, which I think is unique. We really 
are a launch system designed for the 21st century to bring better 
reliability and safety."With NASA's space shuttle fleetretired (the last shuttle missions flew

 A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
