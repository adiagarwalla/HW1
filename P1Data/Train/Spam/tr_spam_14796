1.—Oyster Loaf.

Take a loaf of bread, cut off the crusts, dig out the centre, making a box of it, brush it all over with melted butter and put into the oven to brown. Fill with creamed oysters, cover the top with fried bread crumbs, put into the oven for a minute and serve. Garnish with parsley.
2.—Broiled Sweetbreads.

For these use veal sweetbreads. Wash and parboil them and cut in half lengthwise. When cold, season with salt and pepper, and pour over them a little melted butter. Broil over a clear fire about 5 minutes. Serve with melted butter and chopped parsley poured over them.
3.—Liver and Onions.

Take 1 lb. of liver, cover it with boiling[Pg 15] water and let it stand for five minutes, then cut it into dice. Into a frying pan put 3 slices of fat bacon and fry. When the fat is fried out add the liver and 4 onions, sliced thin; cook until done. Add a tablespoonful of flour, salt, and pepper. Mix well and serve.
4.—Broiled Beef and Mushroom Sauce.

Stew ½ a can of mushrooms in 1 oz. of butter, salt, and cayenne pepper. Have ready mashed potatoes. Put them in a mound in the centre of a hot dish; make a hole in the centre, pour in the mushrooms, lay against the outside of the mound slices of cold roast beef.
5.—Kornlet Omelet.

Melt 1 tablespoonful of butter; cook in this 1 tablespoonful of flour, ¼ of a tablespoonful each of salt and pepper, then add gradually ½ a cup of kornlet. When the mixture boils, remove from the fire and stir in the yolks of three eggs beaten until thick, then fold in the whites of the eggs beaten dry. Turn into an omelet pan, in which two tablespoonfuls of butter have been[Pg 16] melted. Spread evenly in the pan and let cook until "set" on the bottom, then put into the oven. When a knife cut down into the omelet comes out clean, score across the top at right angles to the handle of the pan. Fold and turn onto a heated dish.—Janet M. Hill, in "Boston Cooking School Magazine."
6.—Liver Rolls.

Have ½ a lb. of calf's liver cut in thin slices, parboil for 5 minutes, wipe each piece dry, lay a thin slice of bacon on each slice of liver, season with salt and pepper, roll up and fasten with a wooden toothpick, dredge with flour and fry until done in bacon fat or drippings. When done take out the rolls and thicken the gravy with a little brown flour. If there is not gravy enough add a little boiling water. A teaspoonful of mushroom catsup added to the gravy is an improvement or a squeeze of onion juice.
