iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

Todd Akin, R-Mo"The president has repealed `don't ask, don't tell' and is 
using the military as props to promote his gay agenda," said Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is running for Senate.The committee, on a vote 
of 37-24, backed an amendment that barred same-sex marriages or "marriage-like" ceremonies 
on military installations. The panel also endorsed an Akin amendment that said 
the services should accommodate the rights of conscience of members of the 
services and chaplains who are morally or religiously opposed to expressions of 
human sexuality.In an odd exchange, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., questioned what would 
happen if a service member literally interpreted the Old Testament's Leviticus, which 
considers homosexuality an abomination. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., disputed her contention that 
was part of the Bible, saying it was the Old Testament.House committee 
members did not specifically m

was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could

"The vehicle is designed to be very, very simple, and inherently more 
safe and reliable. We really believe the whole system is designed for 
success." [Photos: ATK's Liberty Rocket and Capsule]Introducing the Liberty systemThe spacecraft will 
be able to carry seven passengers, or various combinations of crew and 
cargo. ATK also hopes to provide launch services for U.S. government satellites 
eventually, Rominger said.The composite crew module was built by ATK at its 
Iuka, Miss., facility as part of an earlier NASA program headed by 
the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. from 2007 to 2010. 
The program aimed to assess whether composite materials were a viable alternative 
to aluminum lithium on NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is being 
built for future manned exploration flights to deep space."For Liberty, it made 
a huge amount of sense since composites were one o

f our competencies," Rominger said. "We wanted to pull in all the 
supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe
