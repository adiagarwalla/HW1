<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster

a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos
