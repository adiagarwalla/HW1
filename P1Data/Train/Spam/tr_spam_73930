who believe the U.S. government has gone too far in seeking to 
punish Manning.
Nov. 14: Director Clint Eastwood (R) and his wife Dina Ruiz Eastwood 
arrive at the Museum of Tolerance International Film Festival gala awards presentation 
in his honor in Los Angeles. (Reuters)Is Clint Eastwood going the way 
of the Kardashians? Apparently so, as his wife and two of his 
daughters are currently shooting a family reality show intended to air on 
the E! network, TMZ has learned.Sources connected to the production tell TMZ 
that the show will explore what it's like to live in a 
family of "Hollywood royalty."It will focus on the relationship between Clint's wife 
Dina Eastwood, their daughter Morgan and Clint's 18-year-old daughter Francesca, an aspiring 
actress.Were told 81-year-old Clint has agreed to make a couple of cameos 
-- but will not be a main character on the show.The show 
is being produced by reality powerhouse Bunim/Murray -- the same people who 
produce all of the Kardashian reality shows, along with "The Real World" 
and "Bad Girls Club."S

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Christmas season is upon us and the star that sits atop 
the Billboard 200 tree is none other than Michael Bubl, whose holiday 
album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number 
5 on the Billboard 200.As Winehouse's album gives fans an opportunity to 
reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they 
"have some major touring plans for 2012."Another artist who will be taking

deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi
