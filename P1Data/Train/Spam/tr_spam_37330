t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then 
er members were upset with the union spending dues on non-union concerns."We're 
not happy," she said on Fox News. "When you pay dues, you 
think you're paying for a better work environment."SEUIs political action committee reported 
$70.4 billion in expenditures for the 2008 Obama campaign, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. And the union, which has 2.1 million members 
and is the fastest-growing union in North America, endorsed Obamas re-election campaign 
back in November 2011.SEIU will reportedly pay the rent for six months 
so Occupy protesters can plan demonstrations, workshops and continue to advocate for 
the 99 percent (of Americans) to have a say in returning the 
country to a just political and economic system.The union did not return 
a call to verify it is paying the rent.Occupy DC was essentially 
evicted in February from McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, 
for continuing to camp overnight on federal land. District officials ha
ff the dinner with a contest in which supporters can register to 
win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop 
singer who is now a Broadway star. The fundraiser is for Obamas 
dedicated gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender coalition. Its hard to ask people 
to fork over $30,000 while simultaneously expl

"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting

work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of
