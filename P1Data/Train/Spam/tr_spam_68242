nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i
exas with a wife and daughter," said wide receiver Roy Williams, who 
previously played with Hurd in Dallas."It's sad for him," said linebacker Brian 
Urlacher. "I'm not sure what's going on, but you never want to 
hear about one of your teammates, something like this happening to them. 
He's a good teammate. That's what I know of him. He comes 
to work every day and works hard. Outside of here, I don't 
know him very well."Hurd, a native of San Antonio who played in 
college at Northern Illinois, has eight catches for 109 yards this season 
as a backup receiver.The NewsCore contributed to this report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">aqi government would not let the United States take Daqduq out of 
the country for trial, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said."We have sought 
and received assurances that he will be tried for his crimes," Vietor 
said Friday.It was not immediately clear what charges he could face. The 
U.S. has said he was part of a brazen raid in which 
four American soldiers were abducted and killed in the Iraqi holy city 
of Karbala in 2007.Iraq has had a shoddy record on detainee security. 
Last year, just a week after the U.S. turned more than 1,000 
detainees at its Camp Cropper prison over to Iraqi control, four al-Qaida-linked 
detainees escaped. An investigation showed that the detainees had inside help.That had 
lawmakers worried that Daqduq would return to Hezbollah soon after his transfer. 
Shortly before the White House announcement, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was gathering 
signatures on a letter to Obama."Daqduq's Iranian paymasters would like nothing more 
than to see him
  to $141 billion, or 10 percent of its portfolio in 2006, 
and $244 billion, or 14 percent, by 2008.In a May 2007 speech 
in New York, he said Freddie had "basically no subprime exposure," according 
to the suit."Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives told the world that 
their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was," said Robert 
Khuzami, SEC's enforcement director."These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute 
investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the 
market about the amount of risk."Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about 
half of U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million loans.The Bush administration seized 
control of the mortgage giants in September 2008.So far, the companies have 
cost taxpayers almost $150 billion -- the largest bailout of the financial 
crisis. They could cost up to $259 billion, according to its government 
regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Administration.The o
e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.
