<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Came with with a party of 11 and got the private room which was 9815980 perfect because my group of people are rowdy and they will get extra rowdy when there is alcohol involved. 

1) Lobster Salad with Chestnut Mousse, 9815980 Persimmon, Pomegranate and Honey-Vanilla Vinaigrette - This is so good. I can't believe how big the portion was. I was expecting just a bite of lobster but I got a whole tail and a claw. Very fresh, almost everyone at the table ordered this to start with.

2) Glazed Oysters with Osetra Caviar, Zucchini Pearls and Lettuce Cream - For oyster lovers, get this! Its not a lot to eat, but the oysters and caviar went so well together in this creamy broth stuff, I wanted a whole lot more.

3) Seared Sea Scallops with Zucchini-Basil Pur??e, 54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4 Beech Mushrooms, Melted Leeks and Sauce Mar??chal - 2 large pieces of scallop pan-fried to perfection. What more can I say? If you're a seafood lover like I am, this is pretty damn good.

4) Guinea Hen Breast with Roasted Baby Beets, 9815980 Goat Cheese Mousse and Champagne Braised Savoy Cabbage - I needed some heavy protein for the night so I went with the guinea hen. Good stuff, very large portions and filled me up. The meat was moist and came with beets and cheese on a tiny little pie crust on the side. So cute!

5) Strawberry Souffl?? with Strawberry 9815980 Sauce and Strawberry Sorbet - NEVER IN MY LIFE HAVE I HAD SUCH DELICIOUS SOUFFLE!!!! OH MY GOD, YOU CAN'T GO WRONG WITH ORDERING A SOUFFLE AT GARY DANKO FOR DESSERT! Whether it be the chocolate souffle or the strawberry one, you have to order either one! I have never had strawberry souffle before so I went with something I have never tried. It was damn good with warm strawberry sauce poured into the middle with an ooey gooey center, and topped with strawberry sorbet. My favorite part of this entire meal.

The service was extraordinary. 9815980 ll our meals came out all at the same time with 4 waiters serving us so nobody had to wait awkwardly for their friend's plate to arrive. They cleaned us up well after each plate and refilled drinks whenever necessary. I loved it.

Whole meal came with a complimentary pastry wrapped in gold foil and ribbon for breakfast tomorrow! What!!!! Oh Gary Danko, you're so thoughtful and sweet!54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4
