ey light their homes."Upton said he was not opposed to the more 
efficient -- and expensive-- curlicue fluorescents that have become increasingly familiar in 
recent years. But he said government should not penalize those who prefer 
traditional, incandescent bulbs."New lighting options are great news for the public, but 
the lesson is that markets and consumer demand are the best drivers 
of innovation and new choices," Upton said.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the move would have little 
practical consequence, since it does not affect a 2007 law that requires 
manufacturers to produce or import more efficient bulbs. The five largest light 
bulb manufacturers have already switched to making and selling the more efficient 
bulbs, Bingaman said, so the enforcement delay only serves to confuse the 
public."Blocking funds to enforce minimum standards works against our nation getting the 
full benefits of energy efficien
WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP Oprah Winfrey One of the stars of Oprah Winfreys struggling OWN 
Network is claiming that he is now homeless, broke and battling alcoholism 
-- and its all Winfreys fault.Star Magazine, via RadarOnline.com, reports that Robert 
Dupount, who stars on OWNs upcoming reality show Beverlys Full House, is 
telling friends that the former talk show titan ruined his life by 
having her network film his interactions with former supermodel Beverly Johnson.Robert is 
homeless now and he blames the show," a source told Star. He 
told me, Producers were egging on the drama. It took a toll 
on my relationship with Beverly.According to the source, things got so bad 
that Dupont had to move out of the house he was sharing 
with Johnson. Producers offered to pay his expenses through Jan. 1st, including 
putting him up at a Holiday Inn Express, but then they allegedly 
reneged on the offer and stuck Dupont with the bill.The source claims 
that Dupont, a recovering drug addict and alcohol

after it ran out of fuel.He made his way to Oregon in 
a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first to leave 
$100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Wash. From Oregon, authorities said, 
Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from the parking 
lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane and made 
for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles away, where authorities finally caught 
him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.Fox bought the movie rights 
in a deal that could be worth $1.3 million, and Dustin Lance 
Black, who won an Academy Award for writing the movie "Milk," about 
the gay rights activist Harvey Milk, is working on the screenplay. He's 
met with Harris-Moore several times at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, 
according to Lance Rosen, Harris-Moore's entertainment lawyer.Harris-Moore doesn't get to keep any

has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula, 
Mont., a man spent more than $1,200 to pay down the balances 
of six customers whose layaway orders were about to be returned to 
a Kmart store's inventory because of late payments.Store employees reached one benefici
