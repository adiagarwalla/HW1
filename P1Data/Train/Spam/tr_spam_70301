First up the sweet tea was great as they bring out 23417781 unsweetened tea and with it they give you a small glass of sweet water to sweeten it by. The turkey sandwich was a big sandwich with special seasonings and flavor to add a special taste to it.  The truffle fries were one of a kind as they taste like no other place I know of.  The ketchup they bring you is house made and not store bought. The ketchup had a sweet taste to it which I liked. 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I was not thrilled about going to Canoe. Looking at their menu, I thought it would be the same old stuff as I would get at South City Kitchen, 23417781 Empire State South, or Common Quarter. 

Sure, 10 years ago, maybe Canoe would've been the bomb. But many farm-to-table, new-American restaurants popped up since then. So I thought I would be jaded by Canoe. 

Boy, I was wrong. Canoe is similar 23417781 to those restaurants, but Canoe takes it a step higher. It is definitely a fancy-smacy, high-end restaurant. The service and food are high-class. I was pleasantly surprised. 

We ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e What's cool about these appetizers, since we were sharing them, are that they made them into little courses. If you come with 2 people, you can probably order all the appetizers and have a 10-11 course meal. In fact, that is one option I recommend. 

Before the appetizers came, the bread lady came with several kinds of breads. We tried them all. All of the breads tasted good. I liked the cranberry bread the best.

For my appetizers, I tried their Hickory 23417781 Smoked Duck Pastrami and their Oysters on the Half Shell. The Duck Pastrami was amazing. I loved everything that came with it. The Radish, Blood Orange, Beets, and Rye matched well with the duck. 

The Oysters were delicious as well. They tasted fresh and loved whatever stuff they put on it. 

For the entree, I tried the Slow Roasted 23417781 Georgia Rabbit. It was a very good rabbit. The rabbit meat melted apart. The candied garlic sauce and the juice from the rabbit gave it a great flavor. It comes with Goat Cheese Tortellini, but I got it with bucatini because of the lactose in the Goat Cheese. I thought the bucatini was overcooked, however. Maybe changing the dish messed with the chefs. 

Canoe is sensitive to whatever food allergies 23417781 you might have. So if you need to change a dish, they will do it with no problem. So I was happy they changed the tortellini. 

I also tried the trout. I wasn't a fan. But it was done well. The skin was nice and crispy and seemed like a great dish. I just didn't find it appealing for some reason. 

I loved my rabbit, drinks, and the appetizers. Our server seemed very knowledgeable about a lot of stuff on their menu. Don't be afraid to ask a lot of questions like we did! The food wasn't perfect. I give it about 4.5 stars.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
