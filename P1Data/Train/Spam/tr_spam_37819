e two-month tax cut is estimated to be worth about $165 for 
someone making $50,000 a year.While lawmakers will say that the mortgage fee 
hike means the payroll tax cut is fully paid for, the timetables 
for the tax cut itself and the revenue from the fee are 
very different.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that while the tax cut lasts 
two months, it will take 10 years for the associated fee hike 
to drum up an estimated $35.7 billion and replenish the lost revenue. 
That rhetorical tactic is common on Capitol Hill -- lawmakers frequently say 
bills are "paid for" when in fact it takes a decade for 
that to be the case.Fox News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.

a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Dec. 8, 2011: Images aired by Iranian state television show the secret 
U.S. drone that went down last week in eastern Iran. WASHINGTON  
A U.S. official says Iran will find it hard to exploit any 
data and technology aboard the captured CIA stealth drone because of measures 
taken to limit the intelligence value of drones operating over hostile territory.The 
official also said Saturday that despite Iran's latest claims to have hijacked 
the RQ-170 Sentinel and brought it down near the eastern Iranian city 
of Kashmar, the U.S. is convinced that the drone malfunctioned."The Iranians had 
nothing to do with it," the official said.The official, who could speak 
about classified matters only on condition of anonymity, did not provide details. 
But independent experts say the data and communications of the unmanned aircraft 
are heavily encrypted, making it difficult for Iran to harvest much intelligence 
from them. U.S. officials previously have said the drones have no self-d

ristmas," Pelosi said."We are witnessing a pattern of Speaker Boehner walking away 
from bipartisan compromises to kowtow to his extreme Tea Party wing of 
his caucus," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus. "This is the latest example of the Tea Party Republicans sacrificing 
the good of the country on the alter of extreme ideology."But Republican 
Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan, said the short-term extension only ensures "more 
uncertainty.""How irresponsible for the U.S. Senate to pass only a two-month extension 
and then adjourn, essentially saying since they want to go home for 
Christmas the U.S. House must either take it or leave it?" she 
asked.
