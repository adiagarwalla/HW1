 as one of the top few drug dealers in Chicago, according 
to local radio station 670 The Score, which cited a "drug enforcement 
officer working on the case." The station also reported that authorities have 
a list in "the double digits," of NFL players who had bought 
drugs from Hurd.Hurd, who played for the Cowboys from 2006-10, signed a 
three-year contract worth up to $5 million with the Bears in the 
summer. He received a $1.35 million signing bonus and was being paid 
$685,000 this season."We are aware of Sam's arrest and are continuing to 
gather details surrounding it. We are disappointed whenever these circumstances arise. We 
will deal with them appropriately once we have all the information," the 
Bears said in a statement.His Bears teammates expressed surprise about the situation 
Thursday."It's a situation I don't want anyone to be in, especially a 
close friend, a teammate that I have been playing with now for 
four or five years now, especially a guy from T
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai
hreatened by the widespread tendency to have recourse exclusively to the criteria 
of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl
 iece of material data about loans held by Fannie Mae was known 
to the United States government to the investing public," Mudd said. "The 
SEC is wrong, and I look forward to a court where fairness 
and reason -- not politics -- is the standard for justice."Syron's lawyer 
couldn't be immediately reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Fannie told investors 
in 2007 that it had roughly $4.8 billion worth of subprime loans 
on its books, or just 0.2 percent of its portfolio. The SEC 
says that Fannie actually had about $43 billion worth of products targeted 
to borrowers with weak credit, or 11 percent of its holdings.Mudd told 
a congressional panel in March 2007 that Fannie's subprime business represented less 
than "2 percent of our book." He also said the company held 
subprime mortgages "very carefully."Freddie told investors in 2006 that it held between 
$2 billion and $6 billion of subprime mortgages on its books. The 
SEC says its holdings were actually closer
 focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.
