 Cream the butter, add sugar and chocolate, then the unbeaten eggs and vanilla, and beat together until very smooth. Sift the baking powder with one-half a cup of the flour, and use first; then alternate the milk and the remaining flour, and make the mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon. Beat until very smooth and bake in loaf in moderate oven. For tests see Cocoa Cake recipe on page 25.
CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM

    1 quart of milk,
    Pinch of salt,
    3 squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    3 level tablespoonfuls of flour,
    1 can of sweetened condensed milk,
    3 eggs,
    6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    3 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.

Put milk, salt and chocolate in double-boiler, and when milk is hot and chocolate has melted, stir in the flour, previously mixed in a little cold milk. Cook ten minutes, then pour this over the condensed milk, eggs and sugar mixed together; cook again for four minutes, stirring. Strain, and when cool add vanilla, and freeze.
CHOCOLATE WHIP

    1 cup of milk,
    1 ¬Ω squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    Pinch of salt,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch,
    2 eggs (yolks),
    6 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla,
    5 eggs (whites).

Put milk, chocolate and salt in double-boiler; mix cornstarch in a small quantity of cold milk, and stir into the hot milk when the chocolate has been melted; stir until smooth, then cook twelve minutes. Mix together the yolks of the eggs and sugar, then pour the hot mixture over it; cook again one or two minutes, stirring. When very cold, just before serving, add the vanilla and fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pile lightly in a glass dish and serve with lady fingers. A meringue can be made of the whites of the eggs and sugar, then folded in the chocolate mixture, but it does not stand as long.
COCOA MARBLE CAKE

    6 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    1 cup of granulated sugar,
    3 eggs,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    ¬æ a cup of milk.

Three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, about one and three-quarter cups of sifted flour, or flour enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon. Mix in the order given. Reserve one-third of this mixture and add to it four level tablespoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa and to the other one cup of shredded cocoanut. Bake thirty-five or forty minutes according to size and shape of pan.
CHOCOLATE MARBLE CAKE

This is the same as the Cocoa Marble Cake. Add to one-third of the mixture one and one-half squares of Baker's Chocolate in place of the cocoa, and one cup of chopped walnuts to the other part in place of the shredded cocoanut.
CHOCOLATE JELLY

    1 pint of boiling water,
    1/3 a package of gelatine,
    2 pinches of salt,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    1 ¬Ω squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put the water, salt and chocolate in a saucepan. Cook, stirring until the chocolate melts, then let it boil for three or five minutes. Soften the gelatine in a little cold water and pour the boiling mixture over it. Stir until dissolved, then add sugar and vanilla. Pour into a mould and set aside to harden, serve with cream and powdered sugar or sweetened whipped cream.
COTTAGE PUDDING

    4 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    2 eggs,
    1 cup of sugar,
    ¬æ a cup of milk.

Two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one and three-quarter cups of sifted flour or enough to make mixture stiff enough to drop from the spoon. Bake in buttered gem pans in moderately hot oven twenty-three or twenty-five minutes. If the cake springs back after pressing a finger on the top, it shows that it is baked enough. To make a cocoa cottage pudding add to the above rule six level tablespoonfuls of cocoa. Serve with a vanilla sauce.
VANILLA SAUCE

    2 level tablespoonfuls of butter,
    1 cup of boiling water,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,
    4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,

    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0A Point, as here it is defined, is not naturall and to bee perceived by sense; Because sense onely perceiveth that which is a body; And if there be any thing lesse then other to be perceived by sense, that is called a Point. Wherefore a Point is no Magnitude: But it is onely that which in a Magnitude is conceived and imagined to bee undivisible. And although it be voide of all bignesse or Magnitude, yet is it the beginning of all magnitudes, the beginning I meane potentiâ, in powre.

8. Magnitudes commensurable, are those which one and the same measure doth measure: Contrariwise, Magnitudes incommensurable are those, which the same measure cannot measure. 1, 2. d. X.

Magnitudes compared betweene themselves in respect of numbers have Symmetry or commensurability, and [10]Reason or rationality: Of themselves, Congruity and Adscription. But the measure of a magnitude is onely by supposition, and at the discretion of the Geometer, to take as pleaseth him, whether an ynch, an hand breadth, foote, or any other thing whatsoever, for a measure. Therefore two magnitudes, the one a foote long, the other two foote long, are commensurable; because the magnitude of one foote doth measure them both, the first once, the second twice. But some magnitudes there are which have no common measure, as the Diagony of a quadrate and his side, 116. p. X. actu, in deede, are Asymmetra, incommensurable: And yet they are potentiâ, by power, symmetra, commensurable, to witt by their quadrates: For the quadrate of the diagony is double to the quadrate of the side.

9. Rationall Magnitudes are those whose reason may bee expressed by a number of the measure given. Contrariwise they are irrationalls. 5. d. X.

Ratio, Reason, Rate, or Rationality, what it is our Authour (and likewise Salignacus) have taught us in the first Chapter of the second booke of their Arithmetickes: Thither therefore I referre thee.

Data mensura, a Measure given or assigned, is of Euclide called Rhetè, that is spoken, (or which may be uttered) definite, certaine, to witt which may bee expressed by some number, which is no other then that, which as we said, was called mensura famosa, a knowne or famous measure.
