nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and
. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
stake in a Saudi media company that produces the influential Arabic language 
newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The 
redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, 
as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.The company earlier this 
year raised $400 million

the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah

APDecember 1, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio leaves his news 
conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.WASHINGTON  House Republicans will vote down 
a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the 
problem of a negotiating a longer deal into next year."Americans are tired 
of short-term fixes. Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut 
needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a 
bill to do just that," said House Speaker John Boehner.Boehner said the 
House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and 
take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular 
order of business.But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be 
the last one of the year, and they have no plans to
