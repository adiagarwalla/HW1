        Hola!

        Gracias por participar! La palabra "feijoada" viene de "feij=FF=FFo"=
 (poroto, "beans").

        El plato existe en Portugal y Brasil. Fue creada por los esclavos qu=
e cocinaban las partes del cerdo que no eran comidas por sus due=FF=FFos (me=
 revolta la palabra due=FF=FFo en
 este sentido).

        Bom apetite!

        I hate to say that - this well-known English expression, how would i=

        I know Brazilian dubbed movies have it as "Detesto ter de dizer isso=
..." ou "Detesto admitir isso..." but this is not real Portuguese, only a l=
iteral translation from=20
English.
        I was wondering whether there is an equivalent expression to it in B=
razil.

        My guesses:

        "Infelizmente" (a poor one, I admit)
        "=FF=FF uma pena, mas"

        Gostava de poder ajudar melhor, mas porque n=FF=FFo tentar "Que =FF=FF=

        Hi, Fara=FF=FF

        I was thinking about your contribution "Que =FF=FFdio" - I am not su=
re about it, I must admit. I believe the expression "I hate to say that" as =
in "I hate to say that but I
=FF=FFm afraid I won't drink this beer", for example, does not have this fee=
ling
 of hatred, anyway. I think it is a way of expressing politeness when saying=
 something (that is true) in a more direct way.

        But I'm not sure about that, I hate to say it...

        Sorry, Car_linha, but 'Lamento ter que diz=FF=FF-lo, mas eu n=FF=FFo=
 vou beber esta cerveja' doesn't sound natural anyway. I would use something=
 like: "Desculpa, mas n=FF=FFo vou tom

        Hola!

        Gracias por participar! La palabra "feijoada" viene de "feij=FF=FFo"=
 (poroto, "beans").

        El plato existe en Portugal y Brasil. Fue creada por los esclavos qu=
e cocinaban las partes del cerdo que no eran comidas por sus due=FF=FFos (me=
 revolta la palabra due=FF=FFo en
 este sentido).

        Bom apetite!

    Default "Detesto dizer isso?......."

        I hate to say that - this well-known English expression, how would i=
t translate to Brazilian Portuguese?

        I know Brazilian dubbed movies have it as "Detesto ter de dizer isso=
..." ou "Detesto admitir isso..." but this is not real Portuguese, only a l=
iteral translation from=20
English.
        I was wondering whether there is an equivalent expression to it in B=
razil.

        My guesses:

        "Infelizmente" (a poor one, I admit)
        "=FF=FF uma pena, mas"

        Qu=FF=FF se yo

        "Detesto (ter de) dizer isso" =FF=FF portugu=FF=FFs, pelo menos para=
 mim, mesmo que seja tradu=FF=FF=FF=FFo literal.
        Gostava de poder ajudar melhor, mas porque n=FF=FFo tentar "Que =FF=FF=
