okeswoman said the U.S. does not discuss "specific security posture, but commanders 
continually assess the current force protection status and make adjustments as needed."Obama 
spoke with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak overnight Monday, according to the 
White House, to reaffirm "the United States' strong commitment to the stability 
of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally."National security 
officials will stay in close coordination as the situation develops, the White 
House said. In a separate statement, Press Secretary Jay Carney said the 
U.S. is also staying in touch with Japan.According to a "special broadcast" 
by state media in Pyongyang late Sunday, Kim died Saturday of a 
heart ailment while on a train due to "great mental and physical 
strain" during a "high intensity field inspection." North Korea will hold a 
national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's funeral will be held on 
Dec. 28, the report said.But in a demonstration of son

September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
IOWA CITY, Iowa  Republican Party officials in Iowa are taking new 
steps to secure their vote counting systems after an anonymous threat suggested 
computer hackers could attempt to disrupt next month's presidential nominating caucuses.A video 
uploaded to YouTube features a computer-generated voice denouncing a corrupt political system 
and calls on supporters to "peacefully shut down" the Jan. 3 caucuses.The 
video claims to be from Anonymous, a loosely organized group of hackers 
who have successfully conducted past computer attacks.Investigators aren't sure whether the video 
is authentic, but party officials have instructed precinct caucuses to use paper 
ballots as a backup system and taken other steps to protect the 
database and website that displays caucus results.The party fears such a delay 
could disrupt the traditional influence of the Iowa caucuses. Candidates who do 
well tend to gain momentum in the presidential race, while those finishing

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">sings.Globally, the San Francisco-based company has more than 100 million active users 
who post an average of 250 million messages, or "tweets," a day."We 
believe that social media will fundamentally change the media industry landscape in 
the coming years," Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and 
international investments, said in a statement. "Twitter will capture and monetize this 
positive trend."Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to 
provide further details.Alwaleed owns 95 percent KHC, which has a major stakes 
in Citigroup Inc., Apple Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.His Twitter investment 
comes as Arab activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter 
to coordinate protests and voice their opposition to long-ruling autocratic regimes.Arabic is 
now the fastest growing language on Twitter, according to a study released 
last month by French social media research firm Semiocast.Although Arabic tw
 n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability 
ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
