"font-size: xx-small;">I heard that white kidney beans extract helps to del=
ay digestion and absorption of carbohydrates which result in loosing weight=
. In my opinion, in general beans are fillers which make you feeling full y=
et it has very high calories. I think it is some brilliant entrepreneur ide=
as to making it rich on weight loss. In any case, I prefer the real thing w=
ithout replacing or substitute with chemicals etc. The only time I use whit=
e kidney beans is making a Chinese pork rib stew with some preserved mustar=
d green and you guessed right, nobody wanted to eat it. Then I don&#39;t co=
ok anymore white or red kidney beans because of its high protein content, h=
igh calories and also time consuming. We still have the red kidney beans so=
up as dessert, end of Chinese dinner in the restaurant, or some asian cakes=
 (Chinese and Japanese cakes like mochi, chi chi (sesame ball) baked bread =
and buns) with red kidney beans paste. One thing proven is by eating red or=
 white kidney beans in paste, soup but not extract, during pregnancy, will =
give the baby a very good skin and smooth complexion which my children can =
showcase and vouch for itUltimately, The way I understand low carb diets to=
 work so well at losing fat is this: When carbs are not used through exerci=
se or normal body functions, they convert to fat. Also carbs like simple su=
gars spike insulin levels which just converts everything to fat. So what de=
creasing your carb intake significantly does is one, make sure that your no=
t taking in excess fat. And more importantly 2, forces your body to use fat=
 and possibly protein as primary energy sources. So by having to use fat, i=
t increases oxidation of fats in your body, and therefore, burns straight u=
p fat. But be aware that your body does need some level of carbs to keep wo=
rking. Also much of the weight you lose while on a low carb diet can be eas=
ily gained back after you start eating carbs again. So the best plan is to =
decrease your carb intake when possible, make a diet you can LIVE with, not=
 just something to lose a few pounds only to gain them backI&#39;ve heard t=
hat it helps you to lose weight faster, but the problem is then keeping the=
 weight off. At least 45 from carbs, making a low-carb diet really unhealthy, and once you begin to=
 eat carbs again it becomes really hard to keep the weight off because it a=
lters your metabolism.You are so smart my friend, so smart that you want ot=
hers to believe what you think. There are many like you on earth and you wi=
ll certainly have company in Hell someday when the likes of you are gone. W=
ithout God, only evil will exist and you are one of its product. A pity rea=
lly because you are using your God given intellect to urge others to join t=
he Legions of others like you. Why look so bad at Religion when it teaches =
only goodness and love to all. Would you rather have a world that offers no=
thing but hate towards your fellowmen ?Are you a person who do not have fri=
ends around you everyday? Do you hate people when they do not show their lo=
ve to you. You are not so smart then my friend&quot;, try and greet all wit=
h a smile and maybe a hug...then you will be rewarded with joy and gladness=
 wherever you go. Although this may not sound all that bad, a high-protein,=
 low-carb diet also comes with a lot of health risks. When you cut out carb=
s and take in a lot of protein, you put your body at risk for things like o=
steoporosis, high cholesterol, and ketosis. Ketosis is a dangerous metaboli=
c state that mimics diabetes in a sense, and can cause organs to fail and r=
esult in gout, kidney stones and even kidney failure. You need to consume a=
t least 100 grams of carbs a day to prevent Ketosis.it can help, but the on=
ly reason it works is because you are cutting calories by doing this, if yo=
u cut any other food group out and didnt replace it, you would also loose w=
eight.There are theories that carbs can make you gain weight but its only i=
f you consume too much of them. Many carbs are made from refined foods such=
 as white bread, crisps, white pasta, cakes, scones etc which will all rais=
e your blood sugar very quickly, then have it plummet very quickly, this wi=
ll make you feel hungry as it drops. So you eat more- and its this eating m=
ore that will make you put on weight.You CAN eat carbs and loose weight, bu=
t it would be more helpful for you to eat non refined stuff such as brown r=
ice, multigrain bread (not brown bread, brown bread is just white bread whi=
ch has been dyed), whole grain pasta and staying away from sugary stuff. Th=
is will mean your blood sugar isnt rising as quickly, your body has more wo=
rk to do, and you are less likely to have a massive sugar drop 20 mins late=
r.Protein can also help- eat it with the carbs, it will help your body rege=
sted it has eaten, if you do this, then when the carbs have been used up, t=
he body then detects its had protein and it wont give off hunger signals.Go=
od quality fats (non saturates) can also help, they will help your body rea=
lise its been fed but at hours later rahter then straight away as the carbs=
