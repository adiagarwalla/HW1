WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call
 across western Iowa.The leaders of the pack, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls 
in the Palmett
ther executives charged were Fannie's Enrico Dallavecchia, 50, a former chief risk 
officer, and Thomas Lund, 53, a former executive vice president; and Freddie's 
Patricia Cook, 58, a former executive vice president and chief business officer, 
and Donald Bisenius, 53, a former senior vice president.Lund's lawyer, Thomas Levy, 
said in a statement that Lund "did not mislead anyone." Lawyers for 
the other defendants declined to comment Friday morning.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">into bins marked for boy and girls by age group. Obama noted 
more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you, 
how can you go wrong?"The charity's challenge this year, though, is rising 
 BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
aid.Deetman said abuse continued in part because the Catholic church in the 
Netherlands was splintered, so bishops and religious orders sometimes worked autonomously to 
deal with abuse and "did not hang out their dirty laundry."However, he 
said the commission concluded that "it is wrong to talk of a 
culture of silence" by the church as a whole.Bert Smeets, an abuse 
victim who attended the presentation of the report, said it did not 
go far enough in investigating and outlining in precise detail exactly what 
happened."What was happening was sexual abuse, violence, spiritual terror, and that should 
have been investigated," Smeets told The Associated Press. "It remains vague. All 
sorts of things happened, but nobody knows exactly what or by whom. 
This way they avoid responsibility."Archbishop Eijk said victims would be compensated by 
a commission the Dutch church set up last month and which has 
a scale starting at euro5,000 ($6,500) and rising to a maximum of 
euro
