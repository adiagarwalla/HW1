ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said. 
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
 a stellar start to the year, with many markets recovering a 
large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent 
to 20,333.37. Mainland China's main index in Shanghai also fell 1.2 percent 
to 2,268.08.The improved mood over the global economy helped oil prices track 
higher   benchmark oil for March delivery gained 53 cents to 
$99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
