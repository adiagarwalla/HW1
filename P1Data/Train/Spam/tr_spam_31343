Alright I did try it. Did the croutons up this afternoon and they came out p=
retty good. Then this evening I did the chicken. Naturally I did wing it a l=
ittle bit but basically
 followed the recipe as stated. Cut the amounts in half...I baked the chick
en breasts in a pair of nice Corning boats that we have so we each had our o=
wn portions.

Results: Not bad at all. My wife was not quite as enthusiastic as I was but =
she did like it. I think maybe I should have added a touch more lemon and go=
ne a little heavier on=20
the spices and garlic but all in all I was very pleased. The chicken was ve
ry moist and tender, not dried out at all and I was particularly happy about=
 that part. Forty minutes was right on the money timewise. If I do it again =
I would probably hit th
e top under the broiler for a minute of two to encourage a touch more brown
ing.

Thanks again Munky! :-)

"The chicken is cooked perfectly"
Munky I made this recipe tonight and everyone really loved it! I used bread =
crumbs as I did not have croutons (or bread to make any with). And I subbed =
Herbs de Province (rose
mary, fennel, thyme, savory, basil, tarragon, dill, oregano, lavender, cher
vil, marjoram) for the parsley...I know, quite the sub for parsley but I jus=
t didn't have it and I wanted to use something that wouldn't be too overpowe=
ring in any direction.=20
Otherwise, I followed it and it turned out great!

It worked perfectly for a quick supper with family and I served it with mash=
ed potatoes and coleslaw.

Thanks for this, I'll be making it again!

Jeni, I would have used the Herbes de Provence on purpose!

Just seeing this thread for the first time, and this recipe does sound VERY =
good.

ne a little heavier on=20
the spices and garlic but all in all I was very pleased. The chicken was ve
ry moist and tender, not dried out at all and I was particularly happy about=
 that part. Forty minutes was right on the money timewise. If I do it again =
I would probably hit th
e top under the broiler for a minute of two to encourage a touch more brown
ing.

Thanks again Munky! :-)

"The chicken is cooked perfectly"
Munky I made this recipe tonight and everyone really loved it! I used bread =
crumbs as I did not have croutons (or bread to make any with). And I subbed =
Herbs de Province (rose
mary, fennel, thyme, savory, basil, tarragon, dill, oregano, lavender, cher
vil, marjoram) for the parsley...I know, quite the sub for parsley but I jus=
t didn't have it and I wanted to use something that wouldn't be too overpowe=
ring in any direction.=20
Otherwise, I followed it and it turned out great!

It worked perfectly for a quick supper with family and I served it with mash=
ed potatoes and coleslaw.

Thanks for this, I'll be making it again!

Jeni, I would have used the Herbes de Provence on purpose!

Just seeing this thread for the first time, and this recipe does sound VERY =
good.
