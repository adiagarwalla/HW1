beyond existing agreements.Planned Parenthood said it had set up a Breast Health 
Emergency Fund to offset the support that 19 of its local programs 
are expected to lose from the Komen Foundation. But the organization on 
Tuesday did not disguise its disdain for anti-abortion groups that they blame 
for threatening the foundation for its partnership."We are alarmed and saddened that 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed 
to political pressure. Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this 
policy and recommit to the partnership on which so many women count," 
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a 
statement released by the federation.Planned Parenthood has been a continuous target of 
protests, boycotts and funding cutoffs because it is the largest provider of 
abortions in the nation. With almost 800 health centers in the U.S., 
the federation provides other services such as birth control, 
U.S. and other key nations will ease pressure on Tehran.Richard Grenell, a 
former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under the George W. Bush 
administration, told Fox News the Saudi ambassador plot was an attempt by 
Iran to "intimidate the international community." He said sustained sanctions against the 
regime are "clearly not working," and speculated that military action would be 
needed to curb the country's nuclear ambitions.While declining to hazard a guess 
on what Iran's ultimate decision will be pertaining to its nuclear program, 
Clapper said a "key indicator" would be if Iran starts to enrich 
uranium to 90 percent. He said Iran is "well capable" of producing 
highly enriched uranium for a weapon if it chooses to.Lt. Gen. Ronald 
Burgess Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also said that the 
Iranians "have the capability, we assess, to temporarily close" the Strait of 
Hormuz. Iranian officials recently have threatened to close the key oil pa
rriage as a priority issue after failing two yearsa ago to pass 
a similar bill while while a Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, was in 
office. Christie, a Catholic, has repeatedly called for the issue to be 
decided by popular vote.An Assembly panel will consider the bill Thursday. A 
Senate panel forwarded it in a party-line vote last week, with no 
Democrats voting against it and no Republicans voting for it. It must 
clear both houses before being forwarded to Christie.The Associated Press contributed to 
this report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be 
abl
  (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme
et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser
