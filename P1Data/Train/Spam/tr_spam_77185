Japanning, as it is generally understood in Great Britain, is the art of cov=
ering paper, wood, or metal with a more or less thick coating of brilliant v=
arnish, and hardening the same by baking it in an oven at a suitable heat. I=
t originated in Japan=FF=FFhence its name=FF=FFwhere the natives use a natur=
al varnish or lacquer which flows from a certain kind of tree, and which on =
its issuing from the plant is of a creamy tint, but becomes black on exposur=
e to the air. It is mainly with the application of "japan" to metallic surfa=
ces that we are concerned in these pages. Japanning may be said to occupy a =
position midway between painting and porcelain enamelling, and a japanned su=
rface differs from an ordinary painted surface in being far more brilliant, =
smoother, harder, and more durable, and also in retaining its gloss permanen=
tly, in not being easily injured by hot water or by being placed near a fire=
; while real good japanning is characterised by great lustre and adhesivenes=
s to the metal to which it has been applied, and its non-liability to chippi=
ng=FF=FFa fault which, as a rule, stamps the common article.

If the English process of japanning be more simple and produces a less durab=
le, a less costly coating than the Japanese method, yet its practice is not =
so injurious to the health. Indeed, it is a moot point in how far the Japane=
se themselves now utilize their classical process, as the coat of natural ja=
pan on all the articles exhibited at the recent Vienna exhibition as being c=
oated with the natural lacquer, when recovered after six months' immersion i=
n sea water through the sinking of the ship, was destroyed, although it stoo=
d perfectly well on the articles of some age. In the English method, where n=
ecessary, a priming or undercoat is employed. It is customary to fill up any=
 uneven surface, any minute holes or pores, and to render the surface to be =
japanned uniformly smooth. But such an undercoat or priming is not always ap=
plied, the coloured varnish or a proper japan ground being applied directly =
on the surface to be japanned. Formerly this surface usually, if not always,=
 received a priming coat, and it does so still where the surface is coarse, =
uneven, rough, and porous. But where the surface is impervious and smooth, a=
s in the case of metallic surfaces, a priming coat is not applied. It is als=
o unnecessary to apply such a coat in the case of smooth, compact, grained w=
ood. The reason for using this coating is that it effects a considerable sav=
ing in the quantity of varnish used, and because the matter of which the pri=
ming is composed renders the surface of the body to be varnished uniform, an=
d fills up all pores, cracks, and other inequalities, and by its use it is e=
asy after rubbing and water polishing to produce an even surface on which to=
 apply the varnish. The previous application of this undercoat was thus an a=
dvantage in the case of coarse, uneven surfaces that it formed a first and s=
ort of obligatory initial stage in the process of japanning. This initial co=
ating is still applied in many instances. But it has its drawbacks, and thes=
e drawbacks are incidental to the nature of the priming coat which consists =
of size and whiting. The coats or layers of japan proper, that is of varnish=
 and pigment applied over such a priming coat, will be continually liable to=
 crack or peel off with any violent shock, and will not last nearly so long =
as articles japanned with the same materials and altogether in the same way =
but without the undercoat. This defect may be readily perceived by comparing=
 goods that have been in use for some time in the japanning of which an unde=
rcoat has been applied with similar goods in which no such previous coat has=
 been given. Provided a good japan varnish and appropriate pigments have bee=
n used and the japanning well executed, the coats of japan applied without a=
 priming never peel or crack or are in any way damaged except by violence or=
 shock, or that caused by continual ordinary wear and tear caused by such co=
nstant rubbing as will wear away the surface of the japan. But japan coats a=
pplied with a priming coat crack and fly off in flakes at the slightest conc=
ussion, at any knock or fall, more especially at the edges. Those Birmingham=
 manufacturers who were the first to practise japanning only on metals on wh=
ich there was no need for a priming coat did not of course adopt such a prac=
tice. Moreover, they found it equally unnecessary in the case of papier-m=FF=
=FF=FF=FFch=FF=FF=FF=FF and some other goods. Hence Birmingham japanned good=
s wear better than those goods which receive a priming previous to japanning=
.
