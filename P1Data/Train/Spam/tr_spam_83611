small;">Your lowest level is when it&#39;s interfering with your body&#39;s=
 ability to absorb nutrients. Your mid level is excess fluid collecting in =
places it shouldn&#39;t be, like your lungs, you also have problems with yo=
ur organs and brain. Your highest level is Water Poisoning, which is really=
 what all these other problems have been but usually doesn&#39;t get mentio=
ned until you are hospitalized. At the very highest level you could have an=
 organ burst, go into a coma, or just have all your organs (sudden death) o=
r brain (brain dead) fail.Both an excess or intolerance of something tends =
to have the &quot;poisoning&quot; tag. If you have too much C you have some=
 type of Poisoning, if you have too much sun you have Sun Poisoning, if you=
 have too much water you have Water Poisoning.This has been a serious probl=
em in recent years as chugging water, water bottles, and water diets have b=
ecome popular. There have been a rise in deaths and serious complications f=
rom Water Poisoning.. it shot up a few years ago. The reason it&#39;s becom=
ing more well known, unfortunately, isn&#39;t fo the average person damagin=
g themself but for those deaths from contest. One in particular was when a =
Radio Station held a contest, they laughed off the warnings instead of taki=
ng them seriously and having contestants clearly read and understand them. =
The contest was a Pee Holding contest where they had contestants drink what=
 they were told was more water then a human could consume in a day. The win=
ner was a struggling single mother who wanted the latest game system for he=
r kids. She was functioning normally for a couple hours and then was hit wi=
th sudden death. I think her type of Water Poisoning involved excess water =
building up in the brain.It&#39;s probably common at this point for a perso=
n in the US to drink too much water. I would like to note that when the air=
heads came up with recommended water in a day, that included fluid gained f=
rom foods like juicy meats, fruits, veggies, cheese, milk, and dessert. A c=
up is also 8 ounces, which most people are not aware. This means if you are=
 an average height man they think you should get atleast 64 ounces of fluid=
s a day.. but remember... even cookies contain some fluid. If you have a hi=
gh fluid diet, you need to balance it out with things like salt or else it =
will flush nutrients out and seep into places it doesn&#39;t belong. It als=
o will thin your blood, making you more prone to illness and take longer to=
 recover from injury. </span></span></p>=0D
