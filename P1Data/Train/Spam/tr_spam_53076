The district attorney of New York's Suffolk County is disputing the theory 
held by police that one killer is responsible for the murders of 
10 victims whose remains were dumped on Long Island.Suffolk County District Attorney 
Thomas Spota said Thursday he doesn't believe one killer is behind the 
murders, LongIslandPress.com reports.Spota, who said he believes at least one more killer 
is responsible, made the remarks during testimony before the Suffolk legislature's public 
safety committee on Thursday, according to the website.Authorities initially believed several people 
could be involved, but Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said recently 
that investigators believe one serial killer is to blame for the deaths 
-- which include eight women, a man and a toddler found dumped 
along a deserted stretch of Ocean Parkway. Five of the victims have 
been identified as sex workers who advertised their services on Craigslist.Spota said 
he disagrees with the o
BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t
ld Italians that the economic crisis is severe and that they will 
have to tighten their belts.The incident followed a series of parcel-bombing scares 
claimed by the Italian far-left group Federazione Anarchia Informale (Informal Anarchist Federation) 
this month.On Monday, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno also received a letter with 
two bullets and a threatening note signed by the Red Brigades, a 
left-wing terrorist organization responsible for a string of violent acts in the 
1970s and 1980s.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
 Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film 
Several Democratic lawmakers and Jewish advocacy groups are calling on Republican Rep. 
Allen West to apologize after he invoked Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels in 
his criticism of Democrats.The Florida lawmaker cited the infamous Nazi leader when 
asked about a poll that showed Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats 
for gridlock in Washington."If Joseph Goebbels was around, he'd be very proud 
of the Democrat Party, because they have an incredible propaganda machine," West 
was quoted in Politico as saying.Though West is not backing down, the 
remark was quickly condemned by several advocacy groups, including the National Jewish 
Democratic Council.NJDC President David Harris urged West to apologize "immediately.""As we have 
said repeatedly, invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never 
acceptable and should be condemned by all for the sake of the 
memory of those who were lost," Harris said in a statement.Rep. Steve
