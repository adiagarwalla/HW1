I am Mrs. Wand Smith an aging widow suffering from long time illness. I have some funds I inherited from my late husband, the sum of US$18,400,000.00 and I needed a very honest and God fearing Christian that will use the fund for God's work, I found your profile from the internet here, and i decided to contact you. 

Please if you would be able to use the funds for the Lord's work, kindly reply back immediately for further details.


Yours in the Lord,
Mrs. Wand Smith.
