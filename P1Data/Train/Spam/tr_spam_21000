This major scandal has been recently released to the public.
 
It is about a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest corporations in the American food industry.
 
This story is so controversial, Fox News banned it from being aired... they also fired the two covering reporters.
 
If you support the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH Obama after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down?

The Knox-Henderson strip provides a lot of great 4878687 options for drinkers and eaters. The Porch could definitely be one of those options...I caught a glimpse of that greatness today at lunch, but I wish I could have seen more. 
The restaurant itself is right next to Tei Tei Robata 4878687 along the constantly busy street and sidewalk. It shares the big lot with Tei Tei in the back that offers valet (I never understood the valet thing in a parking lot that's right next to the building). When we entered, the place was packed, so we grabbed a tall table with stools in the bar area so we didn't have to wait. We waited for a few moments, not too long, and a manager came by and asked if we had been helped yet. She quickly left and got someone and he came to take our order. We started off with the calamari and shrimp appetizer, and I ordered the crab cake salad for my main course.
The app came out real fast...almost suspiciously too fast. Immediately we both looked at each other while we chewed the rubber like substance that was our calamari. Way overcooked! The shrimp was decent, and the dipping sauce was ok. Just not very well executed. I've read in other reviews that this dish was enjoyable, so it probably was just a one time thing.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
