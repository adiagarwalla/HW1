hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he

resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to

the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration

 APMay 2, 2007: Shown here is Fannie Mae's building in Washington.WASHINGTON -- 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought civil fraud charges against six 
former top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying they misled 
the government and taxpayers about risky subprime mortgages the mortgage giants held 
during the housing bust.Those charged include the agencies' two former CEOs, Fannie's 
Daniel Mudd and Freddie's Richard Syron. They are the highest-profile individuals to 
be charged in connection with the 2008 financial crisis.Mudd, 53, and Syron, 
68, led the mortgage giants when the housing bubble burst in late 
2006 and 2007. The four other top executives also worked for the 
companies during that time.The case was filed in federal court in New 
York City.In a statement released through his attorney, Mudd said the lawsuit 
"should never have been brought" and said the government reviewed and approved 
all of the company's financial disclosures."Every p

the elderly to the polls have served to boost the military's image 
as guardians of the country.
