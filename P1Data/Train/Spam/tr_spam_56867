. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece intended to make prodigies of the little=
 children; it never was ourobject to teach them things that were only fit f=
or men and women: thefact must never be lost sight of that they are infants=
, and that asinfants they must be treated.It is very easy for any one to th=
eorise, and form schemes for thcation of children, and to introduce cha=
nges which may appearbeneficial. Fancy is very prolific, and a number of bo=
oks may easilybe read, and yet the right knowledge not be gained. The chief=
 bookto be studied is the infant mind itself, considered as a great andwond=
erful work of the Creator, with a sincere desire to know allits faculties a=
nd powers, and the various simple laws by which itsoperations are governed.=
 The teacher ought also to turn his thoughtswithin himself, to study his ow=
n mind, especially in his recollectionsof very early childhood, and the mod=
es by which knowledge is graduallyacquired. These things, carefully and dil=
ligently done, will give moreinformation on the proper method ofcating =
and developing the youngmind than the perusal of a hundred volumes. This I =
have endeavouredall my life to do, and have had to deal with many thousands=
 ofchildren who have been to me a book for constant study. From thisextensi=
ve observation and experience, all my plans have been formed,and my opinion=
s derived. If any one has done the same, or more, to himI will gladly conce=
de; but I am not aware that any one individual, noteven Pestalozzi, has run=
 a similar career.CHAPTER VIII.HINTS FOR CONDUCTING AN INFANT SCHOOL._Class=
ification--Getting the children into order--Language--Lessonson objects--Ru=
les to be observed by parents--Daily routine ofinstruction--Opening prayer =
and hymn--Object or developinglessons--Synopsis of a week's instruction--Cl=
