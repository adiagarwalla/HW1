providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears. 
Youll truly feel like youre on top of the Buri Khalifa with 
Cruise.Hope youre not afraid of

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent

from bipartisan compromises to kowtow to his extreme Tea Party wing of 
his caucus," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus. "This is the latest example of the Tea Party Republicans sacrificing 
the good of the country on the alter of extreme ideology."But Republican 
Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan, said the short-term extension only ensures "more 
uncertainty.""How irresponsible for the U.S. Senate to pass only a two-month extension 
and then adjourn, essentially saying since they want to go home for 
Christmas the U.S. House must either take it or leave it?" she 
asked.
 CAIRO  Egypt's Health Ministry says at least three more protesters have 
been killed in clashes with army soldiers in central Cairo, bringing the 
four-day death toll to at least 14.A doctor at a field hospital 
in Cairo's Tahrir Square puts the toll from Monday's violence at six. 
Ahmed Saad says all of them were killed by gunshots.The discrepancy could 
not be immediately reconciled.The clashes have been raging since Friday in and 
around Tahrir, which served as the epicenter of the popular uprising that 
toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.The heavy handed crackdown on protesters 
demanding the ruling military council to step down and hand power to 
a civilian government is unprecedented.The ruling generals described the clashes as part 
of a "conspiracy" against Egypt.Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at

in the United States.The experts say they found the legal authority for 
EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera
