Ashley Tisdale and Scott Speer (X17Online)LOS ANGELES  Disney star Ashley Tisdale 
has split with her boyfriend Scott Speer after more than two years 
of dating, People magazine reported Thursday.Tisdale, who played prima donna Sharpay Evans 
in the "High School Musical" franchise, had been in a relationship with 
Speer, a 29-year-old music video director, since the spring of 2009.HOT SHOTS: 
Ashley TisdaleOver the summer, rumors surfaced that she was dating her former 
"High School Musical" co-star Zac Efron after photos of the two getting 
cozy hit the web.But Tisdale, 26, shot down the reports, insisting she 
and Efron were just friends.
 police. It was unclear how many protesters remain in military police 
custody.On his Twitter account, leading reform figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner 
Mohamed ElBaradei condemned the violence."If the sit-in broke the law, isn't the 
cruelty and brutality used to break it up a greater violation of 
all human rights laws? This is not how nations are managed," he 
wrote.The military took over after longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 
a popular revolt in February. Rights groups and activists charge that the 
military is carrying on the practices of the old regime, including arresting 
and beating dissidents.Protesters at the Cabinet building said the clashes began Thursday 
evening after soldiers severely beat a young man who was taking part 
in the sit-in.Hundreds of people rushed to join the protest after online 
video and photos showed people carrying the wounded man. The pictures showed 
his face and eyes bruised and swollen, his head wrapped in gauze 
and 
ld Italians that the economic crisis is severe and that they will 
have to tighten their belts.The incident followed a series of parcel-bombing scares 
claimed by the Italian far-left group Federazione Anarchia Informale (Informal Anarchist Federation) 
this month.On Monday, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno also received a letter with 
two bullets and a threatening note signed by the Red Brigades, a 
left-wing terrorist organization responsible for a string of violent acts in the 
1970s and 1980s.

the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog.

on unemployment shifted upward -- from 40 percent in October to 45 
percent in the latest poll -- as the jobless rate fell to 
8.6 percent last month, its lowest level since March 2009.But Obama's approval 
rating on his handling of the economy overall remains stagnant: 39 percent 
approve and 60 percent disapprove.Heading into his re-election campaign, the president faces 
a conflicted public that does not support his steering of the economy, 
the most dominant issue for Americans, or his reforms to health care, 
one of his signature accomplishments. Yet they are grappling with whether to 
replace him with Republican contenders Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich."I think he's
