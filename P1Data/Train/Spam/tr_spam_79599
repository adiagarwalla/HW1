largely over continued Israeli settlement construction. With Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze, 
a recent round of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Jordan 
has yielded no breakthroughs.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is under intense international pressure 
to stay at the negotiating table. A final decision is expected after 
Abbas consults with Arab League officials over the weekend. The Palestine Liberation
