 get the mental health treatment he needs."Key to this case is 
that the psychiatrist hired by Connecticut found that my client could not 
conform his actions to the law," attorney Richard Brown told reporters after 
the verdict was read.Daniel Jinich, the victim's father, did not comment on 
the verdict but, in a statement, expressed thanks to the prosecutors, Wesleyan 
University and others for their support and sympathy. Wesleyan students and staff 
who attended the trial declined to comment.During the trial, Madelon Baranoski, a 
forensic psychologist and Yale University professor, testified that Morgan suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia. She said he has delusional thoughts that include prison guards reading 
his mind, video of his thoughts being shown to his family, and 
fellow inmates monitoring him from strategic locations.She said Morgan's mental illness wouldn't 
be immediately apparent to others.Morgan apparently met Justin-Jinich at New York University 
in the
training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
test detective can find the clue to salvage the franchise.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The House has passed a $1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill 
paying for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments and averting a government 
shutdown, while Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut and jobless 
benefits reached a critical phase.The 296-121 vote to approve the spending measure 
represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in a polarized Capitol. The Senate's 
top Republican, meanwhile, raised the stakes in the showdown over the payroll 
tax cut, insisting he won't back a compromise extension unless the bill 
includes language aimed at forcing construction of a Canada-to-Texas pipeline.As negotiations on 
the payroll tax bill proceeded Friday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
said, "I will not be able to support the package that doesn't 
include the pipeline."The GOP's pipeline demands added uncertainty to efforts by McConnell 
and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to quickly reach a deal 
on a bill renewing payroll tax 
 like you know me when you actually have no idea who I 
am or what I am capable of to make sure you never 
talk to me again. You don't deserve to know me and you 
never will. So stop littering my life."Before Morgan's arrest the day following 
the shooting, police announced that he left a journal in the bookstore 
in which he had written about killing Justin-Jinich, going on a shooting 
spree on campus and targeting Jews.Justin-Jinich's family is Jewish; her grandmother was 
a Holocaust survivor. Authorities also said they found an infamous anti-Semitic book, 
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in Morgan's motel room.Authorities say Morgan 
wrote in his journal about all the "beautiful and smart" people at 
Wesleyan, a liberal arts school of about 3,000 students in Middletown, about 
18 miles south of Hartford.Morgan was at a Meriden convenience store, about 
10 miles from the crime scene, when he surrendered to police after 
seeing his photo in a newspaper. It was late in 
t to the U.S. Senate in 2012. But Democratic leaders had hoped 
to run at least a mildly competitive candidate to force Republicans to 
spend money on the Senate race.The Texas Democratic Party had no immediate 
comment Friday evening.
