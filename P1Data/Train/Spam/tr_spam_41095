I like gastropubs because each one is different and unique. This one in particular is quaint. 13376828 I like that the bar is almost a 360 bar and there's a lot of standing space. 

Came in when it opened and there was even a couple of people in there before they officially opened. haha. 13376828 Looked at the menu and drinks. They have a very extensive list of whiskeys, which is really nice. They have craft beers and few interesting cocktails. I ordered the Spiked Cider (perfect getaway from the cold). Though my friend and I had to wait awhile for the cider to warm up, which is understandable since they technically just opened. From a small food menu, deciding what to eat was hard. First, we ordered the Boudin Style Meatball Skillet, which was flavorful and delicious. I really like the sauce that it was in too. Then, we both decided and ordered burgers except my friend added with bacon jam. The whole burger was delicious. Moist, juicy, flavorful. MMMM..... Really good.

So the Bacon Jam needs a paragraph d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec by itself because it was HEAVENLY. The alcohol may have gone to my head at the time, but how could you go wrong with bacon? The bacon jam is sweet and salty and quite addicting. So, after finishing our burger, and just finishing up our drinks. I was thinking what would be good with this bacon jam. So, someone came up to the bar and ordered fries (extra cripsy, which I didn't know that was a thing). And a light bulb lit up. YES, fries. So I asked the bartender if it was possible to do fries with bacon jam, and she's like I don't see why not. Yaay!! :D 

GET FRIES WITH BACON JAM. 

We also asked the bartender to recommend 13376828 a whiskey because we're not too familiar with whiskeys and the type. Of course, with any alcohol, it's a personal choice of what you like. So, she asked if we like smokey, dry, spicy types of flavors. We said a nice smokey one would be good. Then she said the campfire, which we took her recommendation. It was good and smooth. 

Our visit here was very pleasant and relaxing. Great staff. I would love to come here for brunch one day, but I am hardly in the Upper East Side. 

Side note: They're tv's are hidden behind the chalkboards, which I thought was really neat. Only have them on Sundays, I believe.d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec
