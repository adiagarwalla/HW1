		 fantastic full tuna taste and texture at first.  Then 12269250 spices kick in a little more slowly, intensifying in flavor throughout 12269250 bite, with a real nice spicy punch in there at some point as well.  Wow this was an awesome piece of tuna. Somehow we got out of here for under $100 a person despite ordering entrees, appetizers, cocktails and wine.  Good times! Looks like I'm 12269250 minority reviewer with a lower rating here... but it just wasn't anything special (for 12269250 price). We came here for lunch, so I really do not know about dinner.  Here is 12269250 rundown: First off... 12269250 menu is very limited.  I really expected more of a selection.  Points off there.  For 12269250 app, we had 12269250 queso which was really good.  Great mixture of cheeses.  There were not enough of 12269250 blue corn chips though.  Come on Bobby... for another penny or two throw a few more of those on 12269250 plate!  For lunch, 12269250 pork tenderloin sandwich was very good.  12269250 panini style sandwich was crispy, and 12269250 spices were perfect and 12269250 pork was tender.  12269250 only real downside was 12269250 size... not too much filling 12269250 sandwich.  12269250 southwestern fries that came with it were not very good at all... more points off.  Some were soggy and/or oily, and 12269250 seasoning was just meh.  Points could have been added if a good dipping sauce came with it.  I stole my buddies horseradish mustard to use. Service was very good overall with a few flaws.  We did not get 12269250 basket of bread until half way through our meal, and they were a bit slow on 12269250 response when we needed something.  Otherwise our waiter did a good job and was attentive. 12269250 major points off here are for 12269250 price.  It simply was not worth 12269250 money.  For 2 burgers, 1 pork sandwich, 1 app and regular drinks... 12269250 bill was very close to $100 with tax and tip.  My good was decent with flaws, and 12269250 burger was nothing special either (although good).  Do yourself a favor...if you want selection and a decent cost, try somewhere else. So yes, we did have to have a reservation because if we didn't we would be amongst 12269250 many hungry smoke stenched patrons waiting to be seated. But it was worth it!! For starters, we had cocktails at 12269250 bar. 12269250 bar menu didn't list all their beers, just 12269250 imported foo-foo ones which had my husband scratching his head until 12269250 bartender told him 12269250 domestic beers weren't listed but they do serve them. I started off with their hot-pink cactus-pear margarita...it was fresh, tangy and just mouth-watering! Could I say, THEE best margarita I've ever tasted? I proceeded to throw back
