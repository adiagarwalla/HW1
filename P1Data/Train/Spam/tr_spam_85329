Mental distraction


If your guy's having trouble holding himself back in bed, you can take it as a 
compliment! 

 You're obviously getting him hot - fast. An easy way to apply the brakes is 
simply to give him a moment to distract himself.

 When he's thinking about your sexy bod and how great you're making him feel, 
he's bound to get a little over-excited.

 "Turning your thoughts to something unsexual can take your mind off the task 
at hand," explains Annabelle. This gives you both a bit of a boost in the lasting 
longer stakes.
