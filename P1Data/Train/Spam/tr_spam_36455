 MOSCOW  Russian agents have foiled terror attack plans on the Black 
Sea resort of Sochi, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, and seized 
a large amount of weapons and ammunition, authorities said Thursday.Russia's secret service 
agency FSB discovered ten caches of arms and ammunition on May 4 
and May 5 in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the country's National 
Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The region is very close to Sochi.The arms seized 
included portable surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, grenades, rifles and explosives

caches for them.Umarov has previously claimed responsibility for the 2011 deadly bombing

Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal 
and "actively rebuilds the military within the constrained resources available to us."Smith 
said he was pleased that the bill includes new conditions on providing 
aid to Pakistan. "It is imperative that Pakistan support our counterterrorism efforts," 
he said.Election-year maneuvering over the size of the Pentagon budget is unf
