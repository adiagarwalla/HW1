did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or 
punch a small video camera Bale was carrying."What I really wanted to 
do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what 
an inspiration he is," Bale was quoted as saying by CNN.Journalists and 
scores of Chinese human rights activists have soug
 awmakers were shard at work trying to come up with a compromise 
on the payroll tax cut. But with the usual partisan acrimony giving 
way to flashes of cooperation Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 
stressed that he wanted to give negotiators room to talk without trying 
to "prejudge" their proposal.Gone was the kind of definitive language President Obama 
used last week when he declared "I will reject" any attempt to 
tie the Keystone pipeline issue to his proposed payroll tax cut."I'm not 
going to get ahead of the process," Carney said Friday, when asked 
whether Obama could accept a package that extends the payroll tax cut 
but also includes Keystone pipeline language.Republicans want Congress to preserve the provision, 
which would speed up the process for the Keystone XL pipeline. The 
Obama administration recently put the project, which would run 1,700 miles from 
Canada to Texas, on hold so it could be further studied. Republicans,

provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided
