LoLo magazine editor and model Lauren Scruggs interviewing Kellan Lutz (LoLo/Vimeo)A Texas 
model who suffered horrific injuries when she accidentally walked into an airplane 
propeller was recovering Thursday from a surgery to remove her left eye.Lauren 
Scruggs, 23, suffered multiple injuries earlier this month after walking directly into 
the propeller of a small plane following a flight to see an 
aerial view of Christmas lights with a friend. The blades sliced the 
left side of her face, including her eye and cranial nerve, and 
severed her left hand.Her family said in a blog post on their 
CaringBridge page that they had been "praying for a miracle" as they 
waited for Scruggs' left eye to heal. But the model ultimately needed 
to have her eye removed and replaced with a prosthesis.Her family wrote 
that Wednesday's operation at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas went "unbelievably well," 
though they asked for continued support."Along with the pain she was already 
exp
er when they discovered the first of what would become 10 homicide 
victims.Searchers found the latest set of bones at around 9:15 a.m. on 
Tuesday in a dense wetland thicket, about a half mile from where 
Gilbert disappeared after meeting a client for an early-morning sexual encounter.The remains 
were found by homicide detectives about a quarter mile from where authorities 
found the young woman's pants, shoes, pocketbook with ID and other personal 
items.Dormer suggested that Gilbert had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which 
he called a "tough, desolate, tangled mess." He said police think Gilbert 
likely drowned accidentally after fleeing the client's home for an unclear reason 
and that her case is not connected to the serial killings.Authorities have 
not yet positively identified the latest set of skeletal remains. An autopsy 
is expected to take weeks, a police source told FoxNews.com.FoxNews.com's Cristina Corbin 
and the Associated Press contributed to 
o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
 It's been quite a few years since David Heffernan warmed a church 
pew on a regular basis. The Queens, N.Y., native grew up Catholic, 
but he doesn't attend Mass often."Probably a little bit of laziness." he 
says, "or a little bit of shame. It's hard to come back."Heffernan 
is exactly the kind of person a new national ad campaign is 
targeting: lapsed Catholics.According to a Pew study, about 10 percent of American 
adults are former Catholics, with more leaving the church annually than are 
joining.Catholics Come Home, a television advertising campaign, has proved successful in 30 
regional markets, helping raise attendance at Mass by 10 percent overall and 
by as much as 18 percent in some areas.Now, for the first 
time, it's going national -- and potentially reaching 250 million viewers.Tom Peterson, 
president and founder of Catholics Come Home, says of the $3.5 million 
media blitz, "It's taken us over 15 years as a grassroots effort 
to raise that money, and about 
f economic development, hailed the deal and said Russia is ready to 
help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to 
monitor all trade be
