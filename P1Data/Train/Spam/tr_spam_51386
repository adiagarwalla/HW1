o ease the lines by clearing pilots in advance. Some airports have 
a test program and waive us through (Baltimore has this in some 
terminals for example), but others are still struggling to implement it. For 
now, we must go through the same charades as passengers except it 
really is pointless for us.Do you ever hear qualms from passengers about 
your young age?Occasionally, we will hear people commenting that we look like 
kids. But, its really all relative and a matter of perspective. What 
we hear most often is people exclaiming how small the plane is 
or their reference to it as a puddle jumper. This, too, is 
relative and most often heard by infrequent flyers. Seasoned travelers know that 
as many as half of domestic flights today (if not more) are 
operated by regional jets. The flight decks on these aircraft are just 
as modern as mainline aircraft. In fact, most regional jets are fairly 
new from the past decade or so, and they can fly distances 
of more than 
DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's.

 irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency

WASHINGTON  U.S. factories grew in January at the fastest pace in 
seven months, boosted by a rise in new orders. The report bolsters 
other data showing the U.S. economy started the year strong.The Institute for 
Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, says its manufacturing index 
rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 
indicate expansion.Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more 
machinery and other equipment. That has driven factory output. The sector has 
expanded for 29 straight months, according to the index.A measure of hiring 
dipped, indicating factories are still adding jobs but at a slower pace 
than in December. Export orders also rose, a sign that U.S. manufacturers 
haven't yet been affected by Europe's slowing economy.Manufacturing output has jumped in 
recent months. Auto sales have rebounded from the spring, when Japan's earthquake 
disrupted supply chains and fewer cars were availa
