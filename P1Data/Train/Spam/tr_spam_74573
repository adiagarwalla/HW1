NEW YORK  U.S. stock futures are getting a boost from solid 
manufacturing data from around the world as attention turns toward the state 
of the U.S. economy in the run-up to a crucial jobs report.Dow 
futures are up 94 points at 12,671, while the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 futures are up 10 points at 1,318. The Nasdaq composite 
is up 14 points at 2,478.Figures released Wednesday show that China's manufacturing 
sector is growing steadily and Europe's is performing better than forecast. That 
gives investors hope that U.S. manufacturing figures will show the world's largest 
economy continues its recovery.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due 
to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory 
output likely grew at a faster rate in January after businesses spent 
more on industrial machinery, airplanes and other equipment.Investors will also focus on 
the monthly hiring figures from private payrolls agency ADP, which 
nside Pakistan, an acknowledgement of U.S. policy.At Tuesday's White House press briefing, 
reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to 
discuss broadly or specifically supposed covert programs."A senior defense official who spoke 
to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the 
president was careful not to mention the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in 
the program."He came close to crossing a line," this official said, "but 
he didn't say who conducts these missions."The CIA has never acknowledged publicly 
that they in fact carry out the strikes, but officials speaking on 
background have done so repeatedly. The U.S. military has long said it 
has no drone operation over Pakistan.Although Pakistan's government has complained these strikes 
violate its sovereignty, Obama claimed thi
ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial 
in Baghdad.The Iraqi Interior M

executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and

 (AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection
