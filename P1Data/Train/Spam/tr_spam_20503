Govt Push to Stabilize Housing. 2.839http://gohere.regularvalue.click


We did the tasting menu along with one order 4477112 of the wine pairing for the two of us to try. The tasting menu is actually pretty affordable compared to other restaurants so GET IT!!! Also I 4477112 highly recommend the wine pairing as well. They provide a high quality selection of wine that complements each dish oh so well. Everything was OMG FREAKING GOOD except for the Bastilla. I felt like I was eating a dessert course with eggs in it. My absolute favorite dish was the California Sea Bass followed by a super close second of the shrimp.f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb

I've been waiting to try this restaurant ever since it opened up. 4477112 My mom is there way too often and last weekend I finally had an opportunity to join her and check it out! Since then I've gone once more, and I know I'll be back again and again.

My mom and I arrived right at the dinner rush, and of course we didn't have a reservation. I would definitely recommend one - it is ALWAYS busy! At least we were able to order a glass of prosseco to sip on while waiting in the crowded entrance. The place was bustling and energetic - f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb quite loud actually - so not somewhere I would go on a date but rather after work cocktails and dinner. We were seated and immediately ordered a bottle of wine and some oysters. Our waitress was a super cute, bubbly thing who knew my mom by name (and even remembered mine when I returned the second time) and she was fantastic! After the delicious oysters, we decided to split the mussels and the salmon entree, with a side of risotto. Everything was SO yummy, especially the risotto! Since it's on the menu as "Chef's Risotto", 4477112 I'm guessing it changes often and I will definitely be back to have that again. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food for the both of us, but we left STUFFED! It was pricey, but with the wine and oysters (plus the fantastic service!), it was definitely worth it.

I returned last Friday for drinks with a friend, once again the place was packed. We managed to grab a table right by the door, which wasn't my favorite, but we made due. Starting off with cocktails, 4477112 I ordered the "European Love Affair" - sweet and simply delicious! We split an order of the potato rolls, which were lovingly dubbed "crack" by the server, for good reason. These little things are tassssty!!! Must be why it looked like EVERYONE in the restaurant had ordered them as well. Of course, I had to order the mussels again - they are undoubtedly the best mussels I've ever had! The spicy Thai coconut broth is absolutely amazing, and dipping the bread/fries in it afterwards was heavenly. I plan on returning weekly for that delicious dish - I'm afraid I've started what could become a serious addiction for me...

The food, service, and atmosphere exceeded all of my expectations for Notable. I am in LOVE! The only downside is parking in the area sucks, but we could all stand a walk every now and then, amiright? Cant wait to return for lunch (when there is hopefully less of a wait)!f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb
