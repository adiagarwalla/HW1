quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. Oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly. With my heart set on 8179494 spicy chicken & sweet potato hash w/ poached eggs, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it would be good. Two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice 8179494 pattern?) set before my eyes as I wiped a little bit of drool off my face. I can't recall any other time I've experience such explosive flavors all at once. This dish is a bit on 8179494 heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on 8179494 ol' belt loop. 8179494 jumbo lump crab cake isn't on 8179494 regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off 8179494 lunch prix fixe.
