<p style="font-size:xx-small;">A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the

Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican

of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states

Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian
