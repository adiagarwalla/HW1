<font color="white" size="1">keptical about the handling of the accident and the investigation.The Cabinet statement 
cited "serious design flaws and major safety risks" and what it said 
were a string of errors in equipment procurement and management. It also 
criticized the Railways Ministry's rescue efforts.The report affirmed earlier government statements that 
a lightning strike caused one bullet train to stall and then a 
sensor failure and missteps by train controllers allowed a second train to 
keep moving on the same track and slam into it.Those singled out 
for blame included former Minister of Railways Liu Zhijun, a bullet train 
booster who was detained in February amid a graft investigation. Also criticized 
was the general manager of the company that manufactured the signal, who 
died of a heart attack while talking to investigators in August.The decision

<font color="white" size="1">nd drones to stop ships from sailing through the narrow waterway.Iran's navy 
claims it has sonar-evading submarines designed for shallow waters of the Persian 
Gulf, enabling it to hit passing enemy vessels.A closure of the strait 
could temporarily cut off some oil supplies and force shippers to take 
longer, more expensive routes that would drive oil prices higher. It also 
potentially opens the door for a military confrontation that would further rattle 
global oil markets.Iran claimed a victory this month when it captured an 
American surveillance drone almost intact. It went public with its possession of 
the RQ-170 Sentinel to trumpet the downing as a feat of Iran's 
military in a complicated technological and intelligence battle with the U.S.American officials 
have said that U.S. intelligence assessments indicate the drone malfunctioned.
