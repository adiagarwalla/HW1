ng cuts.The House version of the legislation -- priced at more than 
$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal 
drug testing and high school dropouts to get an equivalent to a 
GED. It also provides for the "doctor fix."In addition, the House legislation 
blocks an Environmental Protection Agency rule curbing pollution from industrial boilers and 
extends tax break for businesses buying equipment for 2012.Differences also lie in 
how to pay for the bill. The House bill wants to extend 
the current pay freeze on civilian federal workers for another year and 
requires them to contribute more toward their pensions; raises fee Fannie Mae

who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Kim's 
death would likely delay the effort.With Kim's death, the U.S. is also 
in the position of seeking to reassure China that a security commitment 
with South Korea is not a threat to the North's lone ally. 
China had been expected to host talks on Thursday in Beijing between 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats about restarting nuclear disarmament efforts. That meeting 
in turn could lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that 
would also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The food aid had 
been seen as an incentive to get North Korea to the table,

police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every
