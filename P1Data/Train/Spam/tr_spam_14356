Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. 14261590 The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.

Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - 14261590 This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.

Desserts:
Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert

Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies.  There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
