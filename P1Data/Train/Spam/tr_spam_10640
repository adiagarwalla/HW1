aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions

President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday,

themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops

cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N.

angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated
