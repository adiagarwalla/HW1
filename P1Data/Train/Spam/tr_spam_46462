 FORMULA FOR MAKING THREE GALLONS OF BREAKFAST COCOA

    ¬Ω a pound of Walter Baker & Co.'s Cocoa,
    1 ¬Ω gallons of water, hot,
    1 ¬Ω gallons of milk, hot.

This should not be allowed to boil. Either make it in a large double-boiler, or a large saucepan or kettle over water. Mix the cocoa with enough cold water to make a paste, and be sure it is free from lumps. Heat together the milk and water, and pour in the cocoa; then cook at least an hour, stirring occasionally.
CRACKED COCOA

To one-third a cup of Baker's Cracked Cocoa (sometimes called "Cocoa Nibs") use three cups of cold water; cook slowly at least one hour‚Äîthe longer the better. Then strain the liquid and add one cup (or more if desired) of milk, and serve very hot. Do not allow the mixture to boil after milk has been added.
VANILLA CHOCOLATE WITH WHIPPED CREAM

    One cake (¬Ω a pound) of Walter Baker & Co.'s Vanilla Sweet Chocolate,
    4 cups of boiling water,
    Pinch of salt,
    4 cups of hot milk.

This must be made in a double-boiler. Put the chocolate, boiling water and salt in upper part of the double-boiler. Stir and beat with a wooden spoon until the chocolate is dissolved and smooth. Add the milk and when thoroughly hot, strain, and serve with unsweetened whipped cream. More cooking will improve it.
CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE

Line a pie plate with rich pie crust, putting on an extra edge of crust the same as for custard pie. Fill with the chocolate filling made after the following recipe. Bake in a hot oven until crust is done; remove, and when cool, cover with a meringue and brown very slowly in moderate oven.
CHOCOLATE FILLING

    1 cup of milk,
    Pinch of salt,
    1 ¬Ω squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    2 level tablespoonfuls of flour,
    2 eggs (yolks),
    5 tablespoonfuls of sugar (level),
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Put milk, salt and chocolate in upper part of the double-boiler, and when hot and smooth, stir in the flour, which has been mixed with enough cold milk to be thin enough to pour into the hot milk. Cook, stirring constantly, until it thickens; then let it cook eight or ten minutes. Mix the eggs and sugar together and pour the hot mixture over them, stirring well; put back in double-boiler and cook, stirring constantly one minute. Remove, and when cool add one teaspoonful of vanilla.
MERINGUE

    2 eggs (whites),
    Pinch of salt,
    4 level tablespoonfuls of sugar,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Add salt to eggs and beat in a large shallow dish with fork or egg-whip until stiff and flaky and dish can be turned upside down. Beat in the sugar slowly, then the vanilla, and beat until the dish can be turned upside down.
COCOA STICKS

    6 tablespoonfuls of butter,
    ¬æ cup of sugar (scant),
    1 egg,
    1 tablespoonful of milk,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla or pinch of cinnamon,
    5 teaspoonfuls of Baker's Cocoa,
    1/8 teaspoonful of baking powder,
    1 ¬º to 1 ¬Ω cups of sifted pastry flour.

Cream the butter until soft; add the sugar gradually and beat well; add the beaten egg, milk and vanilla; mix thoroughly. Sift cocoa, baking powder, and a pinch of salt with about one-half cup of the flour; stir this into the mixture first, then use the remainder of the flour, and more if necessary, to make a firm dough that will not stick to the fingers. Set on the ice to harden. Sprinkle the board with cocoa and a very little sugar. Use small pieces of the dough at a time, toss it over the board to prevent sticking, roll out thin, cut in strips about one-half inch wide and three inches long. Place closely in pan and bake in moderately hot oven three or four minutes. Great care should be taken in the baking to prevent burning.

It is advisable to gather the scraps after each rolling, if soft, and set away to harden, for fear of getting in too much cocoa, thus making them bitter.

The colder and harder the dough is, the better it can be handled; therefore it can be made the day before using.

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0Of all other therefore our English foote commeth neerest unto that used by the Greekes: And the learned Master Ro. Hues, was not much amisse, who in his booke or Treatise De Globis, thus writeth of it Pedem nostrum Angli cum Græcorum pedi æqualem invenimus, comparatione facta [7]cum Græcorum pede, quem Agricola & alij ex antiquis monumentis tradiderunt.

Now by any one of these knowne and compared with ours, to all English men well knowne the rest may easily be proportioned out.

2. The thing proposed to bee measured is a Magnitude.

Magnitudo, a Magnitude or Bignesse is the subject about which Geometry is busied. For every Art hath a proper subject about which it doth employ al his rules and precepts: And by this especially they doe differ one from another. So the subject of Grammar was speech; of Logicke, reason; of Arithmeticke, numbers; and so now of Geometry it is a magnitude, all whose kindes, differences and affections, are hereafter to be declared.

3. A Magnitude is a continuall quantity.

A Magnitude is quantitas continua, a continued, or continuall quantity. A number is quantitas discreta, a disjoined quantity: As one, two, three, foure; doe consist of one, two, three, foure unities, which are disjoyned and severed parts: whereas the parts of a Line, Surface, and Body are contained and continued without any manner of disjunction, separation, or distinction at all, as by and by shall better and more plainely appeare. Therefore a Magnitude is here understood to be that whereby every thing to be measured is said to bee great: As a Line from hence is said to be long, a Surface broade, a Body solid: Wherefore Length, Breadth, and solidity are Magnitudes.

4. That is continuum, continuall, whose parts are contained or held together by some common bound.

This definition of it selfe is somewhat obscure, and to be [8]understand onely in a geometricall sense: And it dependeth especially of the common bounde. For the parts (which here are so called) are nothing in the whole, but in a potentia or powre: Neither indeede may the whole magnitude bee conceived, but as it is compact of his parts, which notwithstanding wee may in all places assume or take as conteined and continued with a common bound, which Aristotle nameth a Common limit; but Euclide a Common section, as in a line, is a Point, in a surface, a Line: in a body, a Surface.

5. A bound is the outmost of a Magnitude.
