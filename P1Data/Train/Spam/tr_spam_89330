I've heard this place was hard to get reservations for, 6310020 but I made them for a Wednesday at 630pm for my birthday the night before. I think I lucked out and someone must have canceled because I searched for the next available date and it was like 5 days out.

Anyways, I was 15/20 minutes late 6310020 but my family was able to sit down and order appetizers. I hate when restaurants don't let your party sit because they're not all there.

For appetizers we had the lamb tartare 6310020 which was beautifully made. It was mixed with cucumber so you didn't taste the usual gameyness. Also tried the pork belly which just melted in your mouth. 

Entrees we had the porkchop, the seafood stew, pasta, and the halibut. The seafood stew was by far my favorite. Awesome and garlicky. The porkchop was extremely decadent and rich. The halibut was alright.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
