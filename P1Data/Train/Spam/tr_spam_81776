... but my view is that marriage itself is between a man 
and a woman, and that's my own preference."The Republican Party also reiterated 
its opposition to gay marriage after Obama's statement."While President Obama has played 
politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt 
Romney have been clear. We support maintaining marriage between one man and 
one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that," Republican National 
Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said.Obama said Wednesday that he's tried to stay 
"sensitive" to the fact that for many people "the word marriage was 
something that evokes a very powerful tradition."He also reportedly said he still 
thinks states should be able to decide the issue.Obama actually expressed support 
for same-sex marriages during a 1996 race for Illinois state Senate. He 
later backed off that support, stating during th
he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could
BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn a parallel between Ukraine 
and its authoritarian neighbor Belarus, saying Thursday that people in those countries 
are still living under dictatorship and repression.Merkel's harsh words to Parliament about 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government came amid German efforts to ensure jailed 
former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko receives proper medical care. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment.Several Western governments have spoken out against the legal prosecution 
of Tymoshenko, saying the cases against her are politically motivated.The issue is 
threatening to turn soccer's European Championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland 
next month, into a political embarrassment.Some European officials have vowed to boycott 
matches held in Ukraine over the alleged mistreatment of TymoshenkoTymoshenko, 51, on

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam
 A list of major suicide bombings and large-scale explosions during Syria's 14-month 
uprising:  Dec. 23, 2011    Two car bombers blow 
themselves up near intelligence agency compounds in the capital Damascus, killing 44 
people in the first suicide attacks since the uprising began in March. 
 Jan. 6, 2012    Two weeks later, another suicide 
explosion rips through a busy intersection and a police bus in the 
capital's Midan neighborhood, killing 26 people.  Feb. 10, 2012   
 Two suicide car bombers strike in the northern city of Aleppo, 
Syria's largest, killing 28 people near a military intelligence building and the 
barracks of security forces.  March 3, 2012    A 
suicide car bomb explodes at a roundabout in Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising, killing at least two people in the first suicide attack 
in an opposition stronghold.  March 17, 2012    Three 
suicide bombings in Damascus kill at least 27 people, two of them

President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
