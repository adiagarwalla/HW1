going to have Christmas after all!'" store manager Josine Murrin said.A Kmart 
in Plainfield Township, Mich., called Roberta Carter last week to let her 
know a man had paid all but 40 cents of her $60

upon hearing the news. She and her family have been struggling as 
she seeks a full-time job."My kids will have clothes for Christmas," she 
said.Angie Torres, a stay-at-home mother of four children under the age of 
8, was in the Indianapolis Kmart on Tuesday to make a payment 
on her layaway bill when she learned the woman next to her 
was paying off her account."I started to cry. I couldn't believe it," 
said Torres, who doubted she would have been able to pay off 
the balance. "I was in disbelief. I hugged her and gave her

BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
killed for struggling to win the land for the villagers. We all 
cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac 
failure.Problems in Wukan erupted in violence in September, when hund

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">tend a payroll tax cut through 2012, with major disagreements remaining over 
how to finance the package.The spending bill advanced after Democrats blocked a 
series of GOP assaults on Environmental Protection Agency regulations, though the agency's 
budget absorbed a cut of more than 3 percent.GOP leaders did succeed 
in delays in regulations of coal dust and eliminating federal funding of 
needle exchange programs.War costs would be $115 billion, a $43 billion cut 
from the previous year.
 training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
minated to keep a 2008 campaign pledge. To appease possible dissenters, the 
government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.
