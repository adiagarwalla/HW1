 that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his 
late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said 
at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic."He made 
a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights 
and run several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, 
my day is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement 
after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work 
that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the 
second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn 
and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted 
Bevilacqua's leadership.Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the 
priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took 
orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is sched
nside Pakistan, an acknowledgement of U.S. policy.At Tuesday's White House press briefing, 
reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to 
discuss broadly or specifically supposed covert programs."A senior defense official who spoke 
to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the 
president was careful not to mention the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in 
the program."He came close to crossing a line," this official said, "but 
he didn't say who conducts these missions."The CIA has never acknowledged publicly 
that they in fact carry out the strikes, but officials speaking on 
background have done so repeatedly. The U.S. military has long said it 
has no drone operation over Pakistan.Although Pakistan's government has complained these strikes 
violate its sovereignty, Obama claimed thi
use their training is paid for; school is the biggest expense for 
non-military pilots. It is a double whammy to have loans to pay 
for school and survive on such little pay. But, we love what 
we do so much that we deal with it.Do you get paid 
more if you trained with the military versus at a flight school?No, 
we all start at the same pay at my airline although it 
depends if youre hired as a first officer or captain.Do you ever 
find yourself being treated differently by more experienced pilots because you are 
so young?On the flight deck, it depends. Most pilots respect each other 
and their decisions although occasionally advice and recommendations for how to do 
things are shared. However, there are a few more senior pilots that 
were furloughed from major airlines that now find themselves flying regional jets. 
They feel like they are superior to those who are just starting 
out and often seem a bit condescending. It is all part of 
the learning experience though

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
 CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
APFeb. 1: Israel's President Shimon Peres, left, and United Nations Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon are seen reflected in a door's mirror as they speak 
at a Jerusalem hotel.JERUSALEM  The U.N. chief has told Israel the 
international standoff over Iran's suspect nuclear program must be resolved peacefully.Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon delivered his message at a time of growing concerns that Israel 
could be planning an attack on Iran. Israel, like the West, believes 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons and says no option, including force, can 
be ruled out in stopping it. Iran insists its nuclear program is 
peacefulAt a news conference with Israel's prime minister, Ban urged the Iranians 
to prove their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked whether 
he fears an Israeli attack, he said "there is no alternative to 
a peaceful resolution of these issues."U.N. nuclear inspectors said Wednesday they would 
soon return to Tehran after a "good trip" to the Iranian
