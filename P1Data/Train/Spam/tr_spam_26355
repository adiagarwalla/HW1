 was overloaded and all police helicopter pilots were on vacation at 
the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were
AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">OKLAHOMA CITY  An Oklahoma prosecutor said Friday he "fully expects" more 
young victims to emerge in the case of a former third-grade teacher 
accused of making child pornography involving her students and sharing it online 
with a retired college professor in Pennsylvania.Former McLoud school teacher Kimberly Ann 
Crain, 48, and retired Pennsylvania professor of early childhood development Gary Doby, 
65, were charged Thursday in the case in which prosecutors allege Crain 
took photographs of as many as 14 young girls while they were 
changing in her classroom and at her home and shared them with 
Doby. Crain also is accused of setting up video chats on her 
school computer between her students and a man named "Uncle G," who 
authorities say was Doby."Any person who has a child that's been a 
student of Mrs. Crain has been on pins and needles wondering if 
their child is a victim," said Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon.

federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration
