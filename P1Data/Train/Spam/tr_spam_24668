."Never before has the government forced individuals and organizations to go out 
into the marketplace and buy a product that violates their conscience," Dolan 
said in a web video that takes the battle online. "This shouldn't 
happen in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in 
the Bill of Rights. How about letting our elected leaders know that 
we want religious liberty and rights of consciences restored and the administration's 
mandate rescinded? We can't afford to strike out on this one."Pressed on 
the matter at his daily briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney repeated several times the administration believes it struck an "appropriate balance" 
in crafting the policy."The administration believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate 
balance between respecting religious beliefs and increasing access to important preventive services," 
said Carney. "We will continue to work closely with religious groups during

APJan. 29, 2012: Debris and wreckage lie along the highway after a 
multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near 
Gainesville, Fla. Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup 
on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At 
least five cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into 
flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office

Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki

has been building over Iran's nuclear program. The West is imposing new 
sanctions, charging that Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran denies that and

  false analogy.""It is time for the international community to put aside 
our own differences and send a clear message of support to the 
people of Syria," Clinton said.Russia has stood by Assad as he tries 
to crush an uprising that began last March. In October, Moscow vetoed 
the first Security Council attempt to condemn Syria's crackdown and has shown 
little sign of budging in its rejection of the new measure.The latest 
resolution would demand Assad carry out an Arab League peace plan by 
which he would hand his powers to the vice president and allow 
formation of a unity government to pave the way for elections.On Wednesday, 
shelling and machine gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, 
a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus near 
the Lebanese border, according to online video posted by activists.The valley leads 
to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has 
been under the control of rebel soldiers and pro

percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
