tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">erm, citing Harris-Moore's bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an 
alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out 
the details of his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with 
the court.Harris-Moore's first conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession 
of stolen property, and according to the reports, his first experience with 
burglary came when he broke into the homes of his classmates to 
steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income 
on beer and cigarettes -- something she has denied.Over the next three 
years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among 
other crimes. At one point he was arrested when a detective posed 
as a pizza-delivery driver.In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years 
in a juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in 
Island County. But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and 
was soon back to
 010, after stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second 
time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I
 "It is stressful for my clients that there is yet another extension," 
Borgstrom told AP by telephone."I assume that the Supreme Court will rule 
that Assange should be extradited according to the European Arrest warrant. If 
not, you can scrap it," he said.In a hearing in London in 
February, Judge Howard Riddle had ruled that Assange can be extradited to 
Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he 
would not receive a fair trial there.Assange appealed to the High Court, 
and will now take his legal battle to the country's highest legal 
authority, the Supreme Court. The hearing will be his last avenue in 
Britain to avoid extradition, though lawyers have said they could consider a 
further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
