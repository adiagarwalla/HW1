entrees were prepared well, however the price is not worth it.  In my opinion I would skip over this place and go off the strip to a non tourist trap that is much better food, and much nicer environment.  The decor of this place is that of a TGI Fridays with a slightly more classy twist.  I have dined in a lot of find dining establishments and this did not meet my expectations in the least.  The $13 margaritas on the rocks tasted like it came from mix not made from scratch.   Also to make a reservation for a Saturday night party of 5 took 2 managers to approve and an act of congress. love the Food Network & Bobby Flay, so we tried Mesa on a busy Sunday night at Caesar's after an Aretha Franklin concert let out, at around 10pm. Called for reservation and they had a last minute cancellation, so we got in. Previous reviews are accurate- seating is damn cozy and you can def hear conversations next to you-
