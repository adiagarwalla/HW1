Acrobat Sex Position
 An extreme form of the Rodeo position, the Acrobat is a very intimate transition from its more common cousin. http://www.211web.ru/gallowses The easiest way to get into the Acrobat position is to have the giver lie down on their back then have their partner lie down backwards from the rodeo position. One side note; unlike the Rodeo position, the Acrobat requires the giver to take over stroking duties.
