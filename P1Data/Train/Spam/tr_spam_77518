rriage as a priority issue after failing two yearsa ago to pass 
a similar bill while while a Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, was in 
office. Christie, a Catholic, has repeatedly called for the issue to be 
decided by popular vote.An Assembly panel will consider the bill Thursday. A 
Senate panel forwarded it in a party-line vote last week, with no 
Democrats voting against it and no Republicans voting for it. It must 
clear both houses before being forwarded to Christie.The Associated Press contributed to 
this report.
ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the 
While President Obama will deliver another speech on the economy Wednesday in 
Northern Virginia to keep the focus on jobs, Catholic leaders across the 
country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come 
November.Catholics are fired up over new rules implementing Obama's health care reform 
law forcing Catholic universities, hospitals, and charities to provide insurance for their 
employees covering contraception -- even though that violates church teachings."When you push 
people of faith and you tell them the government is going to 
knock down the wall of separation of church and state and overreach 
like the Obama administration, you've got a war on your hands," Bill 
Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News.In an extraordinary move 
this past weekend, New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan and other archbishops throughout 
the nation had their priests read letters denouncing the Obama administration policy 
from the pulpit at Sunday Mass

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APThe logo for Susan G. Komen's Race for the Cure to raise 
awareness for the fight against breast cancerThe Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure Foundation, a leading charity for breast cancer, announced Tuesday that it 
is ceasing its partnership with Planned Parenthood in prevention screenings andcation 
at the health centers across the nation.Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun told The 
Associated Press that the cutoff results from the charity's newly adopted criteria 
barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or 
federal authorities. Aun said this applies to Planned Parenthood because it's the 
focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants

those responsible for implementing plots, including bombmakers, financiers and facilitators, remain and 
could advance plots," he said.Clapper also said the threat from homegrown extremists 
in the near term will mostly come from "lone actors" and small 
groups inspired by, but not formally affiliated with, Al Qaeda ideology.

A Connecticut man accused of hacking a homeless man to death and 
eating part of his brain was due to be arraigned Wednesday on 
a murder charge, the Connecticut Post reported.Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, is accused 
of killing Angel "Tun Tun" Gonzalez with an ax last December and 
removing the man's eyeballs and part of his brain.Smith, of Ansonia, is 
said to have consumed the dismembered organs in a local cemetery at 
the site of his cousin's grave.Gonzalez's mutilated body lay undiscovered until January, 
when it was found inside a vacant apartment in Bridgeport, Conn., 65 
miles northeast of New York City.Smith was arrested last month in Lynn 
Haven, Fla., where he was held on $1 million bond, until police 
escorted him back to Bridgeport on Tuesday.The suspected cannibal, who is believed 
to have a history of mental health problems, faces up to 60 
years in jail if convicted in Bridgeport Superior Court on Wednesday morning.Smith 
had warned his cousin, Nicole Rabb, tha
