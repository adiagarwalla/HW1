He probably got out a little over his skis, but out of 
generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation
 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

g the slope as trees in its path were stripped bare.Family members, 
many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very
