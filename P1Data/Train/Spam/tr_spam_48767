"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting

May 9, 2012: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Defense Minister Anatoly 
Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s

tears who said they were in the nearby Qazaz First Elementary School 
when the blast occurred. An hour after the blast, the school's gates 
were closed and no one was inside.The explosions left two craters at 
the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 
feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go 
to hospitals to donate blood."The house shook like it was an earthquake," 
housewife Maha Hijazi said as she stood outside her house across the 
street from the targeted compound, which is headquarters for a military intelligence 
department known as the Palestine Branch.The latest major explosion in the capital 
occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt 
near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and 
wounding 26.The previous deadliest att
 n't tell" policy on gays in the military pressed two measures.- Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo"The president has repealed `don't ask, don't tell' and is 
using the military as props to promote his gay agenda," said Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is running for Senate.The committee, on a vote 
of 37-24, backed an amendment that barred same-sex marriages or "marriage-like" ceremonies 
on military installations. The panel also endorsed an Akin amendment that said 
the services should accommodate the rights of conscience of members of the 
services and chaplains who are morally or religiously opposed to expressions of 
human sexuality.In an odd exchange, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., questioned what would 
happen if a service member literally interpreted the Old Testament's Leviticus, which 
considers homosexuality an abomination. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., disputed her contention that 
was part of the Bible, saying it was the Old Testament.House committee

Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
