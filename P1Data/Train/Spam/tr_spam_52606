esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
the 45 people on board the plane Wednesday were potential buyers and 
journalists, said Sunaryo from PT Trimarga Rekatama, the company that helped organize 
the event.The others were Russians, all from Sukhoi companies, an American consultant 
with a local airline and a Frenchman with aircraft engine-maker Snecma.Sign up

OKLAHOMA CITY  Mitt Romney says he believes marriage should be restricted 
to one man and one woman and that he's held that view 
"since running for office."Romney on Wednesday called same sex-marriage "a very tender 
and sensitive topic" as he contrasted his position with President Barack Obama's 
unequivocal declaration of support Wednesday for allowing same-sex couples to marry.Obama is 
the first president in history to support gay marriage. Polls show the 
country is evenly divided on the issue.Romney did not go so far 
as to accuse Obama of changing his position on the issue. Questioned 
by reporters, the presumptive Republican nominee for president said news reports indicate 
Obama has shifted his stance.Romney says states should be able to decide 
whether to grant certain legal benefits to same-sex couples.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions 
in the union-led effort to unseat Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker helps Republicans
 e at least December 2009. That grand jury is examining the investigative 
work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.
