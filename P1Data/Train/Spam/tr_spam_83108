WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t
t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">May 9, 2012: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Defense Minister Anatoly 
Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s
 a ever had on the issue. While officials said Obama was not 
angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated 
on the issue within his own administration. "He,
 for women and children."The attack occurred a day after a roadside 
bomb hit a Syrian military truck shortly after Mood rode by in 
a convoy traveling to the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising.The relentless violence in the country has brought a cease-fire plan 
brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan to the brink of collapse. The 
U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. 
Hundreds more have died since as the conflict has become increasingly militarized, 
with protesters taking up arms or joining forces with army defectors to 
fight a brutal crackdown by regime forces.On Thursday, Annan appealed for calm 
and an end to bloodshed."The Syrian people have already suffered too much," 
Annan said in a statement.Thursday's explosions began about 7:50 a.m. as the 
area was crowded with people going to work or doing morning errands. 
Witnesses said the first explosion attracted curious passers-by, then seconds later, a 
far larger explosi
