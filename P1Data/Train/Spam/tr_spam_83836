. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece

to state and local agencies.What is sustainability in the first place? That 
is a question the study ducks, noting that it is only advising 
EPA on how to bring it within the agencys canon.The experts take 
their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in 
sweeping fashion as the ability to create and maintain conditions, under which 
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the 
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.The study specifically 
notes that although addressing economic issues is not a core part of 
EPAs mission, it is explicitly part of the definition of sustainability.The experience 
of the European Union is deemed particularly relevant to achieving the sustainability 
goal.That Europea

stock markets moved lower amid the news, which raises the possibility of 
increased instability on the divided Korean peninsula.South Korea's Kospi index was down 
3.9 percent at 1,767.89 and Japan's Nikkei 225 index fell 0.8 percent 
to 8,331.00. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 2 percent to 17,929.66 and 
the Shanghai Composite Index dropped 2 percent to 2,178.75.Kim ruled North Korea 
with an iron fist for 17 years. He succeeded his father, revered 
North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, after the elder Kim's death in 
1994. The nation remains one of the last remnants of the Cold 
War era, and is heavily isolated.Kim maintained absolute control of his country 
and kept the world on edge with erratic decisions regarding the country's 
nuclear weapons program.North Korean legend has it that Kim was born on 
Mount Paektu, one of Korea's most cherished sites, in 1942, a birth

millionaires and with the inclusion of provisions regarding Keystone XL pipeline. The 
legislation passed 89-10, but House Republicans say they oppose the plan because 
they want the tax cut to last 12 months and be paid 
for.Romney said he doesn't want to criticize everything the president has done, 
but his economic policies have made it "more difficult for this economy 
to reboot."He added that while the president gets the credit for killing 
Usama bin Laden and claims to have stopped another Great Depression, most 
of his rhetoric is "hollow.""With regards to Usama bin Laden, we're delighted 
that he gave the order," Romney said. "Any president would have done 
that."As for Newt Gingrich, Romney's chief rival in the GOP primary process, 
the candidate said that the point of the campaign is to point 
out differences, and his biggest differences relate to Gingrich's opposition to Medicare

With Iowans incredibly undecided, most candidates are redoubling efforts before voters largely 
tune out the race for the week between Christmas and New Year.Gingrich, 
who faces the toughest criticism on the airwaves, had a conference call 
with reporters and planned to appear on CBS' "Face the Nation" on 
Sunday.As the Iowa vote neared, his decision to take the weekend off 
from campaigning raised eyebrows given his rivals' busy scles.Gingrich has prided himself 
on a nontraditional campaign, but his advantages in the polls could shift 
if the only exposure to Gingrich comes through rivals' negative ads.Paul last 
week released an ad accusing Gingrich of "serial hypocrisy" and Bachmann opened 
her bus tour on Friday suggesting that he was arrogant during this
