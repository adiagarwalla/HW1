seph County Prosecuting Attorney Mike Dvorak into allegations that numerous signatures and 
names on Democratic Party petitions that put then-candidates Barack Obama and Hillary 
Clinton on the primary ballot were forged.Voters have told Fox News that 
their signatures and personal information were fraudulent, and that they never signed 
the petitions that were certified by the St. Joseph County Voter Registration 
Board.U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana David A. Capp has 
previously declined to investigate the allegations, citing a lack of federal jurisdiction."The 
U.S. attorney does not investigate allegations of fraud in the submission of 
petitions by political parties for the placement of the names of candidates 
on the ballot for federal primary elections," Dvorak said in a statement 
in October after discussions with Capp."They do, however, investigate fraud in voter 
registration, the actual voting process, and in the tabulation of ballots."The alle

President Barack Obama and defending their own records in separate TV interviews. 
It was a shift from recent weeks where the two have attacked 
each other, trading accusations about each other's' records and the money each 
has made.In a rare appearance on a Sunday news program, meanwhile, Romney 
portrayed himself as the GOP candidate who is best able to defeat 
Obama next year. Romney defended his years making millions in private business, 
claiming he'll be able to handle attacks from Democrats who are already 
trying to paint him as wealthy and out-of-touch. And he argued that 
his tax proposal is kinder to the middle class and less generous 
to the rich than the flat tax proposals his rivals -- including 
Gingrich -- are backing."The president's going to go after me," Romney said 
on Fox News Sunday. "I'll go after him."Taken together, the pair has

toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing

the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
