emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary

which took the unusual step of going early in huge-screen cinemas to 
build buzz for the general release."The plan was always to put the 
movie out into the best presentation theaters in North America," Harris said. 
"We hoped that people would recognize how good the movie was and 
how special it was being treated."Paramount's comic drama "Young Adult," starring Charlize 
Theron, had a weak expansion into wider release, finishing at No. 7 
with $3.7 million. The film had opened with big numbers a week
