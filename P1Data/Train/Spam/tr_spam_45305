Roost, you guys have impressed me. I was a little hesitant on trying this place because of a friend's previous lackluster experience, 13517433 but you must remember - they change their menu every five weeks- with the exception of the fried cauliflower and the coffee donut dessert. Everything else you ate today may not be there the next time you decide to go to Roost. It's a different experience every time! 

Came in on a Friday night with a friend and it was packed with the exception of a few tables. We were promptly seated and the waiter came to greet us with water and menu's right away. Since it was our first time, 13517433 he explained to us the restaurant's concept and gave us time to peruse the menu. We ordered the soup of the day - (Asparagus soup with creme fraiche), the bread service (you pick a choice of two spreads- we had a hard time deciding our waiter gave us all the spreads on the house.), and for me the pan roasted duck breast. My friend got the braised beef cheeks.  

Asparagus soup with creme fraiche - Creamy, fresh, and vibrant with that lemon zest added in. It tasted like Summer.  bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32 We could not get enough of this soup.
