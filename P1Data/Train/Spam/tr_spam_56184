"Small, simple GPS  jammers can be easily constructed and employed by

his name to Mark Zuckerberg in an attempt to avoid being sued 
by Facebook.According to tech blog ZDNet.com, last week's odd maneuver came after 
Facebook threatened Rotem Guez with a lawsuit over allegations that his company

the spotlight, Ryan Gosling made his way into mainstream movies and the

stars of 2011.Jessica Chastain, who appeared in six movies, and Michael Fassbender, 
who appeared in four, were two actors who couldnt be missed this 
year. And let's not forget their respective Golden Globe nominations for "The
