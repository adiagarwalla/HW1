 WASHINGTON  U.S. factories grew in January at the fastest pace in 
seven months, boosted by a rise in new orders. The report bolsters 
other data showing the U.S. economy started the year strong.The Institute for 
Supply Management, a trade group of purchasing managers, says its manufacturing index 
rose last month to 54.1 from 53.1 in December. Readings above 50 
indicate expansion.Consumers are buying more cars and trucks, while businesses ordered more 
machinery and other equipment. That has driven factory output. The sector has 
expanded for 29 straight months, according to the index.A measure of hiring 
dipped, indicating factories are still adding jobs but at a slower pace 
than in December. Export orders also rose, a sign that U.S. manufacturers 
haven't yet been affected by Europe's slowing economy.Manufacturing output has jumped in 
recent months. Auto sales have rebounded from the spring, when Japan's earthquake 
disrupted supply chains and fewer cars were availa
 Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
leave and five-day suspensions, according to an OSC statement."Because OSC found retaliation, 
it now seeks corrective action for the whistleblowers and disciplinary action against 
the agency officials who engaged in prohibited personnel practices," the statement read. 
"OSC is working with the Air Force to provide relief to these 
whistleblowers."The three officials who allegedly retaliated against the whistleblowers were not identified. 
One of the officials is an active duty military member while the 
other two are civilians.Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said she applauded the whistleblowers 
for their "courage" in coming forward."We expect the Air Force will now 
take appropriate steps to discipline the wrongdoers and deter future acts of 
retaliation," Lerner said in a statement.In a statement to FoxNews.com, Senate Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., called on the Air Force to 
respond quickly to the report."As an author of the Whistleblower Prot

 uled to start in March.The grand jury that charged Lynn last year 
said he "routinely and knowingly placed abusive priests in positions where they 
would have continued access to children" with Bevilacqua's knowledge and under his 
direction.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given 
his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized 
Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances 
before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004."With the passing of Cardinal 
Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes 
and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of 
those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, 
the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College 
in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., 
before being ordained a priest in 1949.He earned a doc

her Mercedes-Benz in an alley on Detroit's East Side, about eight miles 
from the upscale home she shared with her husband and children. A 
man walked into a Michigan police station Tuesday and claimed to be 
an accomplice in the murder of a Detroit marketing executive found strangled 
in the backseat of her car.Joseph Gentz, 48, allegedly said he had 
a direct role in the murder of Jane Bashara, who was found 
dead last Wednesday, and that the woman's husband was also involved in
