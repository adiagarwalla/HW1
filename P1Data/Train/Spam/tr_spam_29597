Many places you grab a hot dog and do it to get something quick 11730929 and predictable. Here you get a hot dog to experience La Dolce Doggie, The "sweet" spot of haut hot dog cuisine. Open for about two years, this spotless bit of the American Dream, has hot dog combos named after the local U's and the pro teams that are oversized, high flavor, FUN.  11730929 The owner goes over his menu with pride and passion, the driving forces in any excellent eatery. His mac and cheese is so waaay beyond good, topped with more cheese and bread croutons, that it is a meal in itself. It made the top ten of one of the local newspapers, and it's well deserved.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I pour a 40 to the memory of the Dominican spot that used to live here. 11730929 As inevitable as the continued hipster encroachment is/was to all things Wynwood, it's nevertheless, disappointing to see things that were of the area give way to yet another iteration of the same ol' thing. But, in this case, the same ol' thing is pretty decent.

One thing about Kush that doesn't and will never work is the size. A space this small is not meant for the crowds it draws. 11730929 When it finally dawned on me *where* Kush was, I wondered how it would work. I am still wondering. Being this crowded and hot is not fun no matter how cold the beer is. The space isn't meant for the number of people the venue regularly holds nor the menu it serves. As the chillrun say, 'you're doing too much.'

The first time I came here, 1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc we were four deep to the bar with no where to stand and drink a beer while pretending that the discomfort was a.) normal and b.) enjoyable. It wasn't. I left wondering why people would be so willfully disingenuous. The beer program is very well-curated (and without much competition in Miami) but it's hard to enjoy said beer when getting pushed, stepped on and pressed on all sides. Keep in mind, this happened on a Tuesday. 11730929 This wasn't my experience on a busy Friday/Saturday night. I found myself in the neighborhood a couple of weeks later and had a better experience. My group was able to fight for a table/seats (well, ottoman). Crouching so low to the ground in a crowded space whilst trying to eat... not the best situation but it is what it is at Kush. I had to deal with it. The farm-style chicken sandwich (with jack cheese, avocado, pickles, BBQ sauce, and arugula, served on wheat) is a savory alternative to beef. I forwent the fries in favor of slaw. It's a vinegar based slaw and quite delicious. I enjoyed it but missed the familiar comfort of fried potatoes to accompany my meal. 11730929 What I didn't miss was the awesomeness of the beer list. At the time of my visits, I was really into lambics and fruit beers and was pleased by the available offerings. So many fantastic drafts is the saving grace of Kush that makes the annoyance of its size and crowd tolerable.

On occasion.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc
