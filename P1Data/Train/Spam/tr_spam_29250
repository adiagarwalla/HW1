  keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's. 
Dont get caught by the paparazzi after just having tried St. Elmo 
Steak Houses famous shrimp cocktail. It is impossible not to make a

and Jenni "J-WOWW" Farley are not welcome in at least one New 
Jersey city.Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer said Tuesday on the city's website that 
a film permit request for a spinoff starring the two "Shore" guidettes 
had been denied.The decision was made "based on protecting public safety and 
quality of life concerns for Hoboken residents," Zimmer wrote.In a letter to 
Jim Bianco, one of the producers of the as-yet-untitled spinoff, she said 
he had a right to appeal the decision, but warned him against 
trying to film without permits as he had admitted to doing in 
another New Jersey town."I write to put you, 495 Productions, MTV and 
Viacom on formal notice that there will be zero tolerance for this 
kind of approach in the City of Hoboken," she said. "Any attempts 
to film in a manner that is not permitted without a permit 
will be dealt with immediately and aggressively."The ca
