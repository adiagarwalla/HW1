PHILADELPHIA  Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the retired head of the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia and an uncharged central figure in a child sex-abuse case that 
involves the alleged shuffling of predator priests to unwitting parishes, has died. 
He was 88.Bevilacqua died in his sleep Tuesday night   days 
after lawyers battled over his competence to testify at an upcoming trial 
   at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburb 
of Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon law, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese.In the days before his death, a 
Philadelphia judge had ruled him competent to testify if 
ful of non-binding contests this month, where the conservative yin and yang, 
Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or 
less and those with grad
APJan. 19: Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani waves at the Supreme 
Court in Islamabad.ISLAMABAD  A spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister says a 
packet containing anthrax was sent to the premier's office one year ago.Akram 
Shaheedi said Wednesday a female professor at a large university in Sindh 
province sent the substance to Yousuf Raza Gilani in January 2011.He says 
tests since confirmed it was anthrax.He says no one was hurt in 
the office.Earlier, a police officer said a toxic substance was sent to 
Gilani three weeks ago.The cause of the apparent inconsistency in the dates 
was unclear.Shaheedi didn't say why he was making the news public now.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
 et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser
to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
