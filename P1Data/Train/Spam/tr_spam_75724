to those disputed regions.
d, especially the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The company's global sales climbed 
22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam

in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
 APJan. 31, 2012: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper listens to a 
question while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.An emboldened Iran is "now 
more willing" to launch an attack inside the United States, America's top 
intelligence official told Congress Tuesday, adding that the global threat posed by 
Al Qaeda's central leadership has been diminished.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper 
outlined what he described as a "critical transition phase for the terrorist 
threat" in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. With Usama bin Laden 
and many of his former deputies dead, Clapper said the group's leadership 
is thinned, its capabilities "degraded" and its focus on "smaller, simpler plots.""Al 
Qaeda core's ability to perform has weakened significantly," he said.At the same 
time, Clapper described the threat from Iran as one on the upswing. 
In a lengthy document submitted to Congress, Clapper said last year's alleged 
Iran-backe
of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights and run 
several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, my day 
is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement after turning 
80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work that year. 
Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the second grand 
jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn and four 
others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted Bevilacqua's leadership.Prosecutors 
said last year that not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."Lynn was the first U.S. 
church official ever charged in the priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. 
His lawyers argue that he took orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is 
scled to start in March.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to
