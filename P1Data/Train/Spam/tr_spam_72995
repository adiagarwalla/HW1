<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
 If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not

or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country --

agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why

have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in
