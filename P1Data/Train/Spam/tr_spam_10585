a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau 
for Statistics, 29 percent of the Dutch population of 16 million identified 
themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the

without congressional action.That same day, a 27 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements 
to doctors would take effect unless lawmakers act, a ction that could 
convince some doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.Obama and congressional Democrats have 
proposed dropping next year's payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent, but an 
extension of this year's 4.2 percent rate seems likely to prevail. The 
payroll tax is the major source of financing for Social Security.Obama also 
wants to leave in place the current maximum of 99 weeks of 
benefits for the long-term unemployed. A payroll tax cut bill approved by 
the House ces that total by 20 weeks, which the administration says 
would cut off 3.3 million individuals. Democrats are hoping to soften if 
not reverse what's in the House version.Even without the Keystone pipeline dispute,

time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I

women's clothing -- was killed in a different manner than the other 
victims, the website reported.Dormer, meanwhile, has said he believes a single person 
is to blame for the bodies, most of them discovered within the 
last year, because all the victims found were linked in some way 
to sex trade. He also said the killer is someone from Suffolk 
or Nassau counties who is very familiar with the area."The sex workers 
dumped in the same place, the ages of the victims and even 
though we did have a male and a toddler's remains found, we 
believe that they may be connected to the sex business," Dormer said 
last month.Dormer announced his new theory just two weeks before authorities found 
another set of skeletal remains believed to be 24-year-old Shannan Gilbert.Gilbert, of 
Jersey City, N.J., was last seen shortly after 5 a.m. on May 
1, 2010, in Oak Beach. Police were searching for her last Decemb

Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a
