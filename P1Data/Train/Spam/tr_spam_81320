<p style="font-size:xx-small;">JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.
 ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15

in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
