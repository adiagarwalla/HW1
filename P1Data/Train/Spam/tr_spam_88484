The Christmas season is upon us and the star that sits atop 
the Billboard 200 tree is none other than Michael Bubl, whose holiday 
album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number 
5 on the Billboard 200.As Winehouse's album gives fans an opportunity to 
reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a 
baby. In a statement, the band says that they will be back 
on the road just as soon as Bud is ready to take 
a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they

the early part of the week in Iowa. He'll head to New 
Hampshire Wednesday, where Romney will already be part way through a four-day 
bus tour. Romney won't return to Iowa until after Christmas.His confidence increasing, 
Romney has stepped away from his aggressive attacks on Gingrich in recent

Sunday's interview, when Romney spoke emotionally about his wife's struggle with multiple 
sclerosis.He said the "toughest time" in his life was standing in the 
doctor's office waiting for her diagnosis. He said he feared she had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal degenerative 
nerve condition.The doctor "did these neurological tests, and then he -- and

Monday, just after wrapping up a seven-year run of Las Vegas shows.Fear 
not, Manilow fans, after the six-week recovery, the "Copacabana" singer will return 
to the stage for thee concerts at the Chicago Theater in February.Another 
legend making news is the Piano Man himself, Billy Joel. A portrait 
of the 62-year-old singer was unveiled in New York City at Steinway 
Hall, home of the famed piano maker Steinway and Sons. Joel is 
one of only two living artists included in the collection and the 
only non-classical performer to receive the honor.While Billy Joel ends his year

 APThis undated photo obtained from a Facebook page shows missing toddler Ayla 
Reynolds.The mother of a missing 20-month-old girl filed paperwork seeking sole custody 
a day before the girl disappeared from the father's home, and she 
said she wants answers from "the last man to see my daughter."Trista 
Reynolds reportedly said she and Ayla Reynold's father have been unable to 
get along in the last few weeks. She said she didn't tell 
the father, Justin DiPietro, that she'd filed the court paperwork Thursday."I've had 
no contact with him; he's had no contact with me. All I 
know is he's the last man to see my daughter, and all 
I want to know where she is," she told ABC's "Good Morning 
America" on Monday.Over the weekend, police appealed for the public's help in 
finding the youngster after the father called police Saturday morning to report 
that his daughter was not in her bed and couldn't be found. 
Ayla was last seen Friday night.Ayla is described as 2-feet-9 inches
WASHINGTON  The Senate on Saturday confirmed Michael McFaul, President Obama's top 
adviser on Russia, to be the next U.S. ambassador to Moscow.The voice 
vote to elevate McFaul to the ambassador's post came on the last 
day the Senate is meeting this year after several months of delay.McFaul 
is regarded as one of the nation's leading experts on U.S. relations 
with Russia, and has been involved in the Obama administration's efforts to 
restore shaky relations with the Moscow government.That includes the signing of the 
New START treaty that set a ceiling of 1,550 strategic warheads in 
each country's arsenal.McFaul, who taught at Stanford, was a campaign adviser to 
Obama on Russia and Eurasia before moving to the National Security Council 
to become the president's chief Russia adviser.Obama nominated McFaul to the post 
in September, but a Senate vote on his confirmation was held up 
by Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., over issues with U.S. policies toward Russia.Kirk
