 "I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li

paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores

GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o
