hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi
en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.
beyond existing agreements.Planned Parenthood said it had set up a Breast Health 
Emergency Fund to offset the support that 19 of its local programs 
are expected to lose from the Komen Foundation. But the organization on 
Tuesday did not disguise its disdain for anti-abortion groups that they blame 
for threatening the foundation for its partnership."We are alarmed and saddened that 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed 
to political pressure. Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this 
policy and recommit to the partnership on which so many women count," 
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a 
statement released by the federation.Planned Parenthood has been a continuous target of 
protests, boycotts and funding cutoffs because it is the largest provider of 
abortions in the nation. With almost 800 health centers in the U.S., 
the federation provides other services such as birth control,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index
 largest unauthorized outpost, set for next month would not be affected by 
the formation of the new committee, officials said.But the panel's makeup aroused 
suspicions it would legalize at least some of the more than 100 
outposts built without government authorization, including dozens Sasson says were erected on 
privately held Palestinian land.The committee's head, former Supreme Court chief justice Edmond 
Levy, spoke out against Israel's withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip 
in 2005. A second panel member, Alan Baker, has represented settlers hoping 
to legalize unauthorized outposts.The international community opposes all Jewish settlement activity in 
the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 
1967 Mideast war. But Israel distinguishes between the 121 settlements established in 
accordance with official prores and the more than 100 unauthorized "outposts" that 
skirted the process with the help of sympathetic authorities and are con
nizant of this."
