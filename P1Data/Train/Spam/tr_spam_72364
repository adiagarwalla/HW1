<p style="font-size:xx-small;">hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving 
heart for people. He was 
  summer of 2007, police say. Justin-Jinich was working at The Red 
and Black Cafe inside Broad Street Books on May 6, 2009, when 
Morgan walked in disguised in a wig and glasses and shot her 
seven times with a handgun before fleeing.Prosecutor Timothy Liston argued in closing 
Friday that Morgan was motivated by "old-fashioned hate.""And she's everything that he 
hates," Liston said. "She's successful, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's Jewish, she 
goes to Wesleyan ... he cyberstalks her, he physically stalks her while 
in disguise ..."Justin-Jinich would have graduated from Wesleyan last year. She was 
a 2006 graduate of the Westtown School, a Quaker boarding school outside 
Philadelphia.Wesleyan spokesman David Pesci said in an email statement Friday that while 
the court's ruling "brings to a close a chapter in this awful 
story, the memory of Johanna, who brought such joy to so many, 
lives on here at Wesleyan."While attending Wesleyan, Justin-Jinich filed a ha
 ary on her cellphone at Seattle Children's Hospital, where her son was 
being treated for an undisclosed illness."She was yelling at the nurses, 'We're 
going to have Christmas after all!'" store manager Josine Murrin said.A Kmart 
in Plainfield Township, Mich., called Roberta Carter last week to let her 
know a man had paid all but 40 cents of her $60 
layaway.Carter, a mother of eight from Grand Rapids, Mich., said she cried 
upon hearing the news. She and her family have been struggling as 
she seeks a full-time job."My kids will have clothes for Christmas," she 
said.Angie Torres, a stay-at-home mother of four children under the age of 
8, was in the Indianapolis Kmart on Tuesday to make a payment 
on her layaway bill when she learned the woman next to her 
was paying off her account."I started to cry. I couldn't believe it," 
said Torres, who doubted she would have been able to pay off 
the balance. "I was in disbelief. I hugged her and gave her 
a kiss."Click here f
