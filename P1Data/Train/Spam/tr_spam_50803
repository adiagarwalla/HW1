APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.
e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Two Wisconsin sisters have reportedly been charged with sexually assaulting a man 
with pliers and forced him to drink urine.Valerie Bartkey, 24, and Amanda 
Johnson, 17, of Somerset, Wis., have each been charged with a felony 
count of second-degree assault by force and misdemeanor counts of battery and 
criminal damage to property, TwinCities.com reports.According to court records, an 18-year-old man 
told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report

 will help shape expectations of Friday's official jobs data, non-farm payrolls.The focus 
on the U.S. will prove a welcome diversion for some traders from 
monitoring the daily developments in Europe's debt crisis.In Europe, the FTSE 100 
index of leading British shares was up 1.3 percent at 5,755 while 
Germany's DAX rose 2 percent to 6,587. The CAC-40 in France was 
1.6 percent higher at 3,350.There are signs that the crisis has eased, 
for now. EU leaders agreed this week to push ahead with a 
closer fiscal union and borrowing rates for Italy and Spain are down 
sharply from just a couple of months ago, suggesting increased investor confidence.Much 
hinges on Greece, where the outlook also appeared brighter. Hopes were growing 
that a debt-ction deal between the country and its private creditors will 
be concluded soon, alongside a second bailout from the eurozone and the 
International Monetary Fund.The sense of an easing in Europe's debt woes helped 
stocks enjoy
ies of standards, including public prominence as measured by polls and fundraising.
