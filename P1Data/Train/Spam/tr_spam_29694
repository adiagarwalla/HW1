the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee

uprising:  Dec. 23, 2011    Two car bombers blow 
themselves up near intelligence agency compounds in the capital Damascus, killing 44 
people in the first suicide attacks since the uprising began in March. 
 Jan. 6, 2012    Two weeks later, another suicide

capital's Midan neighborhood, killing 26 people.  Feb. 10, 2012   
 Two suicide car bombers strike in the northern city of Aleppo, 
Syria's largest, killing 28 people near a military intelligence building and the 
barracks of security forces.  March 3, 2012    A 
suicide car bomb explodes at a roundabout in Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising, killing at least two people in the first suicide attack 
in an opposition stronghold.  March 17, 2012    Three 
suicide bombings in Damascus kill at least 27 people, two of them

 MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He
