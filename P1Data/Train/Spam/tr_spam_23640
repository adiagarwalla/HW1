 and wounded four others. The base is in Kandahar Province in 
southern Afghanistan, and lawmakers have been demanding details about the incident."The insider 
threat is an issue of increasing significance to coalition forces and Afghan 
National Security Forces operating in Afghanistan," the defense officials said. "It creates 
distrust between our forces and their Afghan counterparts during a critical juncture 
in Afghanistan."Among the officials scled to present the data to the committee 
are Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary David Sedney and Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, 
who is the Pentagon's director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan coordination group.While there have 
been some instances of insurgents secretly joining the Afghan security forces, officials 
said it is difficult to determine how often that has happened because 
the infiltrator often remains undetected. Insurgents can easily disguise themselves as Afghan 
security forces and have been doing so more often
testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l
ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial 
in Baghdad.The Iraqi Interior M

claim, however, with liberal columnist E.J. Dionne ripping the policy in a 
Washington Post column. Dionne charged Monday that the president "utterly botched" the 
issue and "threw his progressive Catholic allies under the bus."A report last 
year from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization, found 
that 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used birth control 
despite the church's teachings. According to a Reuters report on the study, 
only 2 percent of Catholic women rely on natural family planning.Nevertheless, the 
bishops have noted in their lobbying campaign that contraceptive coverage would include 
the so-called "morning after pill," opening the door to even more controversy 
over abortion.Carney noted the administration still offers "strong support for existing conscience 
protections, including those relating to health care providers" an

weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have
