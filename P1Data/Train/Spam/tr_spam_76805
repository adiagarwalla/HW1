were accused of agreeing on targets, discussing materials and methods, and researching 
files "containing practical instruction for a terrorist attack."A handwritten target list found 
at one of the defendant's homes listed the names and addresses of 
London Mayor Boris Johnson, two rabbis, the American Embassy and the Stock 
Exchange.Mohammed Chowdhury, 21; Shah Rahman, 28; Gurukanth Desai, 30; and Abdul Miah, 
25, all admitted preparing for acts of terrorism by planning to plant 
an improvised explosive device in the toilets of the London Stock Exchange.The 
other five defendants admitted attending planning meetings, fundraising for terrorism or possessing 
copies of the al-Qaida magazine, Inspire.They will be sentenced next week.
"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
 a stellar start to the year, with many markets recovering a 
large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent 
to 20,333.37. Mainland China's main index in Shanghai also fell 1.2 percent 
to 2,268.08.The improved mood over the global economy helped oil prices track 
higher   benchmark oil for March delivery gained 53 cents to

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">uled to start in March.The grand jury that charged Lynn last year 
said he "routinely and knowingly placed abusive priests in positions where they 
would have continued access to children" with Bevilacqua's knowledge and under his 
direction.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given 
his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized 
Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances 
before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004."With the passing of Cardinal 
Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes 
and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of 
those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, 
the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College 
in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., 
before being ordained a priest in 1949.He earned a doc
  keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's. 
Dont get caught by the paparazzi after just having tried St. Elmo 
Steak Houses famous shrimp cocktail. It is impossible not to make a 
face, she cautioned, alluding to its spiciness.Indianapolis re
Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
