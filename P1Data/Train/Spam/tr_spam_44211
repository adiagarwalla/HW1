 for women and children."The attack occurred a day after a roadside 
bomb hit a Syrian military truck shortly after Mood rode by in 
a convoy traveling to the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising.The relentless violence in the country has brought a cease-fire plan 
brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan to the brink of collapse. The 
U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. 
Hundreds more have died since as the conflict has become increasingly militarized, 
with protesters taking up arms or joining forces with army defectors to 
fight a brutal crackdown by regime forces.On Thursday, Annan appealed for calm 
and an end to bloodshed."The Syrian people have already suffered too much," 
Annan said in a statement.Thursday's explosions began about 7:50 a.m. as the 
area was crowded with people going to work or doing morning errands. 
Witnesses said the first explosion attracted curious passers-by, then seconds later, a

racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led

is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his

that they wanted to try to save her leg, but at this

surgery and performed a high-hip amputation of her left leg. After surgery, 
Copeland suffered cardiac arrest, but the doctors were able to resuscitate her. 
It was at this point that the doctors told Copeland and his
