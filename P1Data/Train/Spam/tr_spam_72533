Ingredients are fresh, and, from local resources.  21705205 Seriously people, if you  are looking for a good damn sandwich this is your joint.  I have been impressed every time I have ordered one.  I like these guys so much I want to take them back to Austin with me when I go!

The staff here are super friendly.  21705205 I like to sit at the small four stool bar.  A lot of times that's not possible.  They have a good selection of classic American sandwiches which they have put their own twist on, and, it's working.  They also have a pretty good beer selection in the cooler.  They use fresh ingredients, not frozen.  Everything from the meats to the veggies to the potatoes to the ice cream is fresh to the bread, is fresh.  

I've had several of their sandwiches, 3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa and, have been more than satisfied each time.  They know what they're doing back there in that kitchen. Another thing I like about them is they will let you add and take away as long as they can accommodate.  I've yet to decide which is my favorite, but, that blackened fish is right up there.  No.  Wait it's the Cuban,  No, hold on, it's that grilled cheese.  Or maybe it's that succulent pulled pork on house slaw.  No!  It's gotta be that shaved ribeye sammich.  Oh man.  I can't flippin' decide.

As far as the burgers here go.  21705205 Definitely one of the best I've had in Dallas.  Seriously.  Their burger will have you licking your lips, and, sucking your fingers.  Uncle Uber's is definitely my favorite food stop in Deep Ellum.  I don't think it's possible to find something you DON'T like here.  I think they slip crack into the food!

Just writing this review has got my tummy screaming for one of their sammiches.  I don't know what they're doing in that kitchen, but, I do know that the food is fresh and delicious.  Come check this place out.  It is a definite winner for a good sandwich.  Don't forget to wipe your ass while you are there!  House rules!!3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa
