1,000 miles easily. That is a pretty large puddle!The airplane has a 
legacy carrier logo name on it; is that who you work for?No. 
While regional jets often bear the branding of a major legacy carrier, 
we are often a smaller independent airline that operates under the banner 
of the larger carrier to provide flight connections and additional frequencies to 
their system of flights. These smaller airlines operate as subcontractors and have 
different safety prores, training departments, and management teams than the larger airlines 
although, all of this is governed by the FAA to insure everything 
is up to par.George Hobica is a syndicated travel journalist and founder

FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents 
further erode support for the in
d the new rules do not change that.But Catholic leaders have noted 
that Catholic hospitals can only invoke the "conscience clause" -- and get 
an exemption on the new rules -- if they turn away patients 
of other faiths, something that is also anathema to the church."That means 
we can't say what we've been saying for 200 years, 'Are you 
hungry?'" retired Cardinal Theodore McCarrick told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. 
"We have to say, 'Are you Catholic?' We don't do that."Sen. Marco 
Rubio, R-Fla., a rising star in GOP circles who has been talked 
up as a potential vice presidential pick, jumped into the fray Tuesday 
by introducing legislation that would block the White House's move.Donohue said he's 
been contacted by Protestants, Mormons, Jews, and others who want to join 
forces with the Catholic League and the bishops to overturn the new 
rules."I've never seen anything like it," he said. "They are lining up 
single file. Quite frankly we are going to take the

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">uled to start in March.The grand jury that charged Lynn last year 
said he "routinely and knowingly placed abusive priests in positions where they 
would have continued access to children" with Bevilacqua's knowledge and under his 
direction.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to preserve his testimony, given 
his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers said he no longer recognized 
Lynn and could not remember much about his own 10 grueling appearances 
before the grand jury in 2003 and 2004."With the passing of Cardinal 
Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full truth about clergy sex crimes 
and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president of the Survivors Network of 
those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was born in 1923, in Brooklyn, 
the ninth of 11 children of Italian immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College 
in 1943, then attended Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y., 
before being ordained a priest in 1949.He earned a doc
 ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
APJan. 31, 2012: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses a Security Council 
meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice --
