Getting things started 


So revealing to your partner that you want to explore BDSM might have you a 
little worried, but don't worry there's no need to be! 

 There's always ways of approaching things to play to your advantage...

 Nichi says: "Springing some hardcore moves on someone is the easiest way to 
put them off BDSM for life, so either have a heart to heart explaining what it is 
exactly you'd like to try or just try taking the sex play in the BDSM direction next 
time you hook up. 

 'If you're the one that fancies dominating, arranging yourself physically on top is 
a good start, followed by a 'my turn to take the lead' remark or similar. 

 A protestation at this stage means a discussion is necessary before you venture 
further. If you get the green light, keep checking in with your partner with a 
series of erotic assertions - 'so it turns you on when I press my hand over your 
mouth?' for example."

 Now you've tested the waters with your http://www.csv.org.pl/guffaws guy it's time to get serious. If you want 
to really get to grips with dominating your guy, it's time to have a look at those 
tips...
