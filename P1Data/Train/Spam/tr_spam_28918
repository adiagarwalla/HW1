Under The Table is a local neighbourhood 12095314 restaurant located in Cabbagetown that serves comfort food along with a few Caribbean dishes. I have been meaning to try this restaurant to see if warranted all the great reviews on Yelp and a restaurant that serves  good comfort food and good Caribbean food in Cabbgetown, that really piqued my interest for some reason.

I got there on a Friday around 5 pm 12095314 and was seated by Kim and one of the first questions I had asked, was how they ended up offering a few Caribbean dishes that really got good reviews since the majority of the menu specialized in comfort foods. Kim told me the chef is Jamaican, so that answered my question why the Caribbean dishes got such good reviews and it assured me the Caribbean dishes were authentic.

I attended up ordering one of the specials of the day which was a steak cobb salad and my companion ordered the oxtail with rice and peas.5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f
