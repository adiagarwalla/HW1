ith the systems avowedly adopted, as theyappear very different in different=
 places. I will only mention furtheron this topic, that many schools are to=
o large. No Infant School, Iconceive, should exceed 200, nor should a Natio=
nal or British andForeign School exceed 400, when under the care of one mas=
ter.One half of these numbers would be much better than the whole, andtend =
greatly to the success of the schools; but funds are so difficultto raise, =
from the apathy shown by persons in general to theinstruction of the poor, =
and therefore the schools are so few innumber, that it is absolutely requis=
ite to place as great a number ofchildren as possible under one master, tha=
t expense may be saved. Whenwill this sad state of things be changed, and t=
he country at large seethat the noblest object it can ever attempt is, to r=
ear up its wholepopulation to intelligence, virtue, and piety?In conclusion=

 to me to be able to add, that since the aboveremarks were written, great i=
mprovements have been made in NationalSchools, a large portion of the publi=
c attention has been lately drawnto the subject, and it is almost universal=
ly admitted that the presentsystem is capable of considerable improvement. =
This must be gratifyingto those persons who have borne the heat and burthen=
 of the day. TheNational Society are taking measures to improve their syste=
ms, andalso by forming Diocesan Societies to establish Normal schools for t=
heinstruction of teachers on improved principles throughout the country.I w=

 fewer enemies, and could now have put on a bolder front.I trust in God tha=
t even now it is not too late, and thatcircumstances may transpire to rende=
r her efforts in this sacred causedoubly effective. She has lately made a n=
oble stand in defence ofprinciple; this will have its proper effect; but sh=

        intimately acquainted with the systems avowedly adopted, as theyapp=
ear very different in different places. I will only mention furtheron this =
topic, that many schools are too large. No Infant School, Iconceive, should=
 exceed 200, nor should a National or British andForeign School exceed 400,=
 when under the care of one master.One half of these numbers would be much =
better than the whole, andtend greatly to the success of the schools; but f=
unds are so difficultto raise, from the apathy shown by persons in general =
to theinstruction of the poor, and therefore the schools are so few innumbe=
r, that it is absolutely requisite to place as great a number ofchildren as=
 possible under one master, that expense may be saved. Whenwill this sad st=
ate of things be changed, and the country at large seethat the noblest obje=
ct it can ever attempt is, to rear up its wholepopulation to intelligence, =
virtue, and piety?In conclusion, I would observe, that as the foregoing rem=
arks havebeen kindly made, in such a manner, it is my hope, they will all b=
ereceived.It is most gratifying to me to be able to add, that since the abo=
veremarks were written, great improvements have been made in NationalSchool=
s, a large portion of the public attention has been lately drawnto the subj=
ect, and it is almost universally admitted that the presentsystem is capabl=
e of considerable improvement. This must be gratifyingto those persons who =
have borne the heat and burthen of the day. TheNational Society are taking =
measures to improve their systems, andalso by forming Diocesan Societies to=
 establish Normal schools for theinstruction of teachers on improved princi=
ples throughout the country.I would to God the Church of England had done t=
his long ago; she wouldhave had fewer enemies, and could now have put on a =
bolder front.I trust in God that even now it is not too late, and thatcircu=
mstances may transpire to render her efforts in this sacred causedoubly eff=
ective. She has lately made a noble stand in defence ofprinciple; this will=
 have its proper effect; but she must not stopthere, for the enemy is in th=
e field; and though he is quiet for atime, the many-headed dragon is not cr=
ushed. The utmost vigilancewill be necessary to counteract the wiliness of =
the serpent; realimprovements incation must be adopted; the books used =
