computers and digital cameras, authorities said.Officers who interviewed Doby at his home 
in Pennsylvania earlier this week said he admitted his relationship with Crain 
and that he communicated with her via Skype and received photos of 
young girls in their underwear, according to the affidavit.Crain and Doby apparently 
met when she was a student and he was a professor at 
Oklahoma Baptist University in Shawnee between 1985 and 1987, Smothermon said. Although 
Smothermon did not disclose the nature of their relationship, court records show 
investigators found evidence of numerous "sexual chats" between the two on Crain's 
computer."Our community is distressed by the alleged crimes," Marty O'Gwynn, assistant to 
the president at OBU said in a statement. "Our thoughts and prayers 
are with the victims and their families."George Wright, an attorney for the 
families of some of the alleged victims in the case, said both 
parents and the children are "traumatized.""They're h
igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration 
officers ba
The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">s home next year.Later at the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney 
was asked whether the president would consider such an offer. Carney said 
that may be the first the president was hearing about this."The first 
lady's commitment to military families is very strong, indeed," he said. "So 
I'm sure she was flattered by the invitation."Obama has supported the Toys 
for Tots campaign for each of the last three years and urges 
White House staff to buy gifts to donate. She said they had 
a 27 percent increase in donations this year."It's not too late to 
donate," she said. "It's still important to nudge our neighbors to give, 
give, give. We need people to bring in toys like never before."Millions 
of families rely on such gifts to make the holidays special for 
their children, she said.She hauled in a big red bag of toys, 
slung over her shoulder to the Washington military base Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. 
She wished volunteers a "Merry Christmas" and helped sort toys 
 Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos
rightest as Winslets heedless husband. Waltzs delivery is impeccable and his candor 
is the most entertaining. Winslet, too, shows a comically detestable side. Theres 
great pleasure in seeing the typically serious actress spiral down to grim 
stupidity. John C. Reilly is delightful, as usual, and provides the only 
realism in the film.Carnage is an inverted and contemporary Lord of the 
Flies, where the adults, not the kids, are stripped to their primal 
selves. When executed well, the story is a superb social experiment, but 
unfortunately Polanski gives us a bland and fizzling undertaking.Stick to the play.
