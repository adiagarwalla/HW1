Israel Antiquities AuthorityA portion of the oldest complete copy of the Ten 
Commandments, on display potentially for the final time in New York CIty's 
Times Square.Just in time for the holidays, the oldest complete copy of 
the Ten Commandments has gone on public display in New York City 
-- and possibly for the last time.The 18-inch long parchment, delicately stitched 
together and inscribed on animal skin, is 2,000 years old, and it 
is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the 
public to see it up close, antiquities experts say.It was added Thursday, 
Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a 
protective vault in Jerusalem."Each piece of the Scrolls is carefully monitored for 
its current condition," show curator Risa Levitt Kohn, a professor of religious 
studies at San Diego State University, told FoxNew
 his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food and 
sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic 
stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. 
Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.Waves 
of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his 
Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after 
stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second time, Harris-Moore 
left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under a running 
faucet.He took cash and a tray of croissants, and Ater's insuran
University of East AngliaThe Climatic Research Unit, a key climate science facility 
at the School of Environmental Sciences, a part of the University of 
East Anglia in the UK.Are your tax dollars helping hide global warming 
data from the public? Internal emails leaked as part of Climategate 2.0 
indicate the answer may be "Yes."The original Climategate emails -- correspondence stolen 
from servers at a research facility in the U.K. and released on 
the Internet in late 2009 -- shook up the field of climate 
research. Now a new batch posted in late November to a Russian 
server shows that scientists at the University of East Anglias Climatic Research 
Unit refused to share their U.S. government-funded data with anyone they thought 
would disagree with them.Making that case in 2009, the then-head of the 
Research Unit, Dr. Phil Jones, told colleagues repeatedly that the U.S. Department 
of Energy was funding his data collection -- and that officials there 
agreed that he

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.
 s request.When contacted by FoxNews.com, DoE spokesman Damien LaVera declined to comment.However, 
climate change researcher and blogger Steve McIntyre forwarded FoxNews.com an email exchange 
from 2005 in which climate scientist Warwick Hughes asked an official at 
a DOE lab if he could get the data that the government 
paid Jones to collect."I am asking you to provide me with the 
following data  DoE has been funding [the data] since the 1980s," 
Hughes noted in his request.But Tom Boden, of the DOE's Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, told Hughes at the time that the DOE itself did 
not have the data, and that "you will need to contact Phil 
[Jones] directly. I spoke today with the DOE program manager who indicated 
Phil was not obligated under the conditions of past or present DOE 
proposal awards to provide these items."McIntyre said he himself later had a 
similar exchange with the DOE, after which "I suggested that they amend 
this as a condition of further financing."
llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system
