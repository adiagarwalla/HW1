l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t

she was last seen Tuesday after a meeting at Detroit Edison's downtown 
headquarters.According to WJBK-TV, Gentz walked into the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department 
at about 4:30 a.m. local time Tuesday and told officers that the 
woman was murdered in her garage and that he helped dispose of 
her body.Police can hold Gentz for up to 72 hours without arresting 
him. A Wayne County prosecutor said Tuesday that no warrants were submitted 
for any arrests in the case.Bob Bashara failed a polygraph test administered 
Friday night, police said. The father of two hired well-known defense attorney 
David Griem, who spoke to reporters after Jane Bashara's funeral Tuesday morning.He 
described Gentz as "very questionable" and added that Bob Bashara identified Gentz 
as someone who may have had it in for the family -- 
and put him on a list of people that police should look 
at.Gentz' neighbors at the 
ria's Arab Spring," Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, said in 
a statement. "Instead of its increasingly futile effort to shield the doomed 
Assad regime, Russia would (do) better to prepare the dictator's Moscow asylum, 
something he will need sooner rather than later."Fox News' Wendell Goler contributed 
to this report.

executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and

important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at
