attorney for Doby and that an extradition hearing hadn't been scled.A not-guilty 
plea was entered on Crain's behalf during her arraignment Thursday in Pottawatomie 
County. Her attorney, Cregg Webb, did not return a phone message Friday 
left at his office in Shawnee.Smothermon said he's also discussing the possibility 
of federal charges, but that Oklahoma statutes carry lengthier sentences."We want to 
make sure we can get the maximum amount of time that we 
can," he said.The case first came to light in November when the 
parents of a 9-year-old girl contacted police after their daughter attended a 
pizza party at Crain's McLoud home. The girl told police Crain had 
several girls change into Christmas-themed bras and panties and then took pictures 
of them decorating a Christmas tree and made a video of them 
doing a cheer dance, according to a police affidavit.Police later uncovered more 
than 100 sexually explicit photographs of young girls from Crain's cellphone, 
WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call
BOWLING GREEN, Ky.  An Iraqi man who had claimed he was 
innocent of terrorism-related charges did an abrupt about-face Friday, pleading guilty to 
trying to funnel weapons and cash to Al Qaeda operatives in his 
home country.Waad Ramadan Alwan, 30, appeared in federal court in this south-central 
Kentucky college town and pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack American soldiers 
in Iraq and to use a weapon of mass destruction and to 
attempting to provide material support to terrorists.Alwan was arrested in May in 
Bowling Green and had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in a 
23-count indictment that also named fellow Iraqi Mohanad Shareef Hammadi.Alwan's attorney declined 
comment after the hearing."Today in open court, Waad Alwan admitted to engaging 
in terrorist activities both here in the United States and in Iraq," 
U.S. Attorney David J. Hale said in a statement. "He acknowledged he 
had built and placed numerous improvised explosive devices (IEDs) aimed at k

to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th

in New York City -- Times Square."What is amazing is how much 
this text has influenced Western secular culture in terms of laws and 
rights even today," Kohn told FoxNews.com.The scroll is expected to draw thousands 
of additional visitors, and long lines were already forming on its first 
day in the exhibit.While the Ten Commandments scroll will return to its 
vault after the New Year, the rest of the exhibit -- including 
500 artifacts and 10 other examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- 
will continue at the Discovery Times Square exhibit until April 15.

Sytek said they had received Gingrich pre-recorded political phone calls in recent 
days. Both are on the do-not-call list.Gingrich's campaign denied wrongdoing. But the 
issue highlights a larger challenge for Gingrich in New Hampshire and elsewhere.He 
had little organization in early voting states until very recently and scrambled 
to hire staff in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa after his 
poll numbers began to rise. Some staffers have been given great autonomy 
to run state-based campaigns, despite having little experience.Gingrich's New Hampshire director, for 
example, is 29-year-old tea party activist Andrew Hemmingway, who had never worked 
on a campaign before being asked to run Gingrich's operation in the 
state with the nation's first presidential primary on Jan. 10."I understand that 
the Gingrich staff is somewhat young and inexperienced, but the rules are 
the rules," said Foley, wh
