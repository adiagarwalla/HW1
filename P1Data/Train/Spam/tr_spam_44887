specific charges, somewhat like a grand jury does in the U.S. system.
ions on a yearlong package do not succeed.Boehner's office said even a 
two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration says it is willing to accept a 
tentative Senate deal to extend a Social Security tax cut and unemployment 
benefits, even though the extension is only for two months.A senior administration 
official also says that a provision requiring a swift decision on a 
Canada-to-Texas pipeline would almost certainly result in President Barack Obama denying the 
permit for the project.The official was not authorized to speak publicly about 
the deal.The official says Obama's top priority was avoiding a tax increase 
on 160 million workers when the payroll tax cut was scled to 
expire at the end of this year. The official said the deal 
met that test.

the store Tuesday evening, the Indianapolis woman in her mid-40s had paid 
the layaway orders for as many as 50 people. On the way 
out, she handed out $50 bills and paid for two carts of 
toys for a woman in line at the cash register."She was doing 
it in the memory of her husband who had just died, and 
she said she wasn't going to be able to spend it and 
wanted to make people happy with it," Deppe said. The woman did 
not identify herself and only asked people to "remember Ben," an apparent 
reference to her husband.Deepe, who said she's worked in retail for 40 
years, had never seen anything like it."It was like an angel fell 
out of the sky and appeared in our store," she said.Most of 
the donors have done their giving secretly.Dona Bremser, an Omaha nurse, was 
at work when a Kmart employee called to tell her that someone 
had paid off the $70 balance of her layaway account, wh

Mubarak was ousted in a popular revolt in February. On Friday, Egypt 
held its second round of parliamentary elections.The legislation restricts aid to Pakistan 
until the secretary can certify that Islamabad is cooperating on counterterrorism, including 
taking steps to prevent terrorist groups such as the Haqqani network from 
operating in the country. The amount was unspecified in the legislation as 
Congress gave the Obama administration flexibility to figure out the funds.A separate 
defense bill would freeze $700 million for Pakistan until the defense secretary 
provides Congress a report on how Islamabad is countering the threat of 
improvised explosive devices.The bill continues the same restrictions on aid to the 
Palestinian Authority, requiring the secretary to certify that it is committed to 
a peacef

to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a 
clear explanation to the international community and Gao's family for this new 
hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be
