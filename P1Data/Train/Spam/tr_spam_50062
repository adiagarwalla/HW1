previously played with Hurd in Dallas."It's sad for him," said linebacker Brian 
Urlacher. "I'm not sure what's going on, but you never want to 
hear about one of your teammates, something like this happening to them. 
He's a good teammate. That's what I know of him. He comes 
to work every day and works hard. Outside of here, I don't 
know him very well."Hurd, a native of San Antonio who played in

to shed light on his case."I will push for Gao Zhisheng being 
able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment

hideous detention," Fu said.He added that "silence was not a diplomatic option" 
and urged the United States and global community to tell Beijing the 
Gao case would hinder its interest in the world.While Gao may be

provides Congress a report on how Islamabad is countering the threat of 
improvised explosive devices.The bill continues the same restrictions on aid to the 
Palestinian Authority, requiring the secretary to certify that it is committed to

protests, the military retains widespread support among many Egyptians who see it 
as the only entity able to run the country until presidential elections 
scled for next year.Images of troops protecting polling centers and soldiers carrying 
the elderly to the polls have served to boost the military's image 
as guardians of the country.
