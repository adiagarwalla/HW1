, the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha
. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after 
midnig
A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the 
economy just at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy."-- 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican 
primary race came to the state four years ago.In 2008 exit polls, 
44 percent of Florida Republican primary voters who described themselves as very 
conservative, picked second-place finisher Mitt Romney -- more than double the share 
of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states 
Republican electorate back then, smaller than somewhat conservative

I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
Department should be taken at face value, Grassley suggested, especially since Holder 
initially denied "gunwalking" had occurred but has since admitted to the operation."Documents 
turned over late Friday night indicate (Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer) was 
still discussing plans to let guns cross the border with Mexican officials 
on the same day the department denied to me in writing that 
ATF would ever let guns walk," Grassley said."He stood mute as this 
administration fought tooth and nail to keep any of this information from 
coming out for a year.It will take a lot more than a 
knee-jerk defense from their political allies in Congress to restore public trust 
in the leadership of the Justice Department. The American people want to 
see those who failed to act be held accountable," he said.
