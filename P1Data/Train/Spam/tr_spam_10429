barry_t@fs.net, 

Consider this shocking fact:  Most of us forget 70-80
I'm  Dr. Steve Klayman.  I recently discovered a new method that's helping 
my patients stop and reverse up to 12 years of mental decline.

This incredible prevention technique will help bring about the end of age-related forgetfulness and hopefully Alzheimer's disease.

End your forgetfulness and memory loss forever, here: http://viewhere.resultsmemoryleft.click



To Your Memory,

Dr. Steve Klayman

My first time trying African food 16776908 and it was AMAZING! To be honest I was a bit hesitant to try African food and wasn't sure what to expect my first time. After trying the food here I can finally say it was not disappointing at all and I'm yearning to come back!

Came here with a friend and 16776908 we ordered the Sports Plate to share & Samusas. The Samusas was a great appetizer and had a nice crisp outer layering and really flavorful meat inside. As for the Sports Plate... IT WAS HUGE and definitely good for sharing. The Sports Plate came with so much food including 2 choices of meat, salad, & rice. I enjoyed every bite of this dish and the meat was just so juicy and well marinated! ALSO, be sure to ask for lots of green sauce because it is so addicting and tastes good with everything... including the Samusas!

If you haven't tried African food yet then you need to go try it here now! I am seriously in love and hope to come back soon! :)8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
