Hello Beneficiary

                                    Re: Your Package For Delivery

I am Mr.Williams G.  Emad, head of luggage/baggage storage facilities here =
at the Honolulu International Airport,Honolulu, HI 96819 USA. During my rec=
ent withheld package routine check at the Airport Storage Vault, I discover=
ed an abandoned shipment from a Diplomat from London and when scanned it re=
vealed an undisclosed sum of money in a metal trunk box. The consignment wa=
s abandoned because the Contents of the consignment was not properly declar=
ed by the consignee as =93MONEY=94 rather it was declared as personal effec=
t to avoid interrogation and also the inability of the diplomat to pay for =
the United States Non Inspection Charges which is $3,700USD. On my assumpti=
on the consignment is still left in our Storage House here at the Honolulu =
International Airport Honolulu till date. The details of the consignment in=
cluding your name, your email address in and the official documents from th=
e United Nations office in Geneva are tagged on the  Trunk box.

However, to enable me confirm if you are the actual recipient of this consi=
gnment as the assistant director of the Inspection Unit, I will advise you =
provide your current Phone Number and Full Address, to enable me cross chec=
k if it corresponds with the address on the official documents including th=
e name of nearest Airport around your city. Please note that this consignme=
nt is supposed to have been returned to the United States Treasury Departme=
nt as unclaimed delivery due to the delays in concluding the clearance proc=
esses so as a result of this, I will not be able to receive your details on=
 my official email account. So in order words to enable me cross check your=
 details, I will advise you send the required details to my private email a=
ddress for quick processing and response. Once I confirm you as the actual =
recipient of the trunk box, I can get everything concluded within 48hours u=
pon your acceptance and proceed to your address for delivery.

Lastly, be informed that the reason I have taken it upon myself to contact =
you personally about this abandoned consignment is because I want us to tra=
nsact this business and share the money 70e consignment has not yet been returned to the United States Treasury Depar=
tment after being abandoned by the diplomat so immediately the confirmation=
 is made, I will go ahead and pay for the United States Non Inspection Fee =
of $3,700 dollars and arrange for the box to be delivered to your doorstep =
Or I can bring it by myself to avoid any more trouble but you have to assur=
e me of my 30
I wait to hear from you urgently if you are still alive and I will apprecia=
te if we can keep this deal confidential. Please get back to me via my priv=
ate Email:(mrwilliamsemad1@yahoo.com) for further directives: You can call =
me on my telephone number or drop a message.


Thank you.
