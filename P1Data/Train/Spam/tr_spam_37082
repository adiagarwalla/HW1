 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
ul co-existence with Israel and is taking appropriate steps to combat terrorism. 
Economic assistance for the Palestinians is in jeopardy if they pursue statehood 
recognition in the United Nations over the objections of the United States 
and Israel, which wants to resume negotiation talks.The amount was not spelled 
out, again leaving it to the administration to sort out.The restrictions carry 
a waiver for national security.In a victory for the Democrats and the 
administration, the bill dropped a House-backed ban on federal money for international 
family planning groups that either offer abortions or provide abortion information, counseling 
or referrals.The policy has bounced in and out of law for the 
past quarter century since Republican President Ronald Reagan first adopted it 1984. 
Democrat Bill Clinton ended the ban in 1993, but Republican George W. 
Bush re-instituted it in 2001 as one of his first acts in 
office. Within days of his inauguration, Obama reverse

personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to

 In this film publicity image released by The Weinstein Company, Jean Dujardin 
portrays George Valentin, left, and Berenice Bejo portrays Peppy Miller in a 
scene from "The Artist." (AP)The best movie of the year, according to 
the Golden Globe nominations? One that went out of style more than 
80 years ago."The Artist," a silent, black-and-white movie about a declining male 
film star and a rising actress in the era when "talkies" were 
replacing soundless movies, earned a leading six Golden Globe nominations on Thursday.

near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish
