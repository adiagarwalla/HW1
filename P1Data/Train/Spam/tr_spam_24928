APDec. 16: Colton Harris-Moore, also known as the 'Barefoot Bandit' glances at 
the courtroom gallery as he walks to the defense table, in Island 
County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and 
distressed people ... They didn't know if they came back from vacation 
their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total 
of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, thef
own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> across western Iowa.The leaders of the pack, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls 
in the Palmett
 funding for Maricopa County.Arpaio has long denied the racial profiling allegations, saying 
people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they have 
committed crimes and that deputies later find many of them are illegal 
immigrants. He also said the decision by Homeland Security to sever ties 
will result in illegal immigrants being released from jail and large numbers.
urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv
