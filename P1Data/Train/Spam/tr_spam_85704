relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37, 

APDec. 16, 2011: Mitt Romney speaks during a rally at Missouri Valley 
Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa 
and beyond with visits to every pizza parlor and diner they can 
find.The second-tier candidates are making a big push. As Texas Gov. Rick 
Perry set out on a statewide Iowa bus tour, Minnesota Rep. Michele 
Bachmann followed an aggressive performance at Thursday night's debate with an aggressive 
scle of stops at restaurants and coffee shops
THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Thousands of children suffered sexual abuse in Dutch 
Catholic institutions, and church officials knew about the abuse but failed to 
adequately address it or help the victims, according to a long-awaited investigation 
released Friday.Archbishop of Utrecht Wim Eijk apologized to victims on behalf of 
the entire Dutch Catholic organization and said the report "fills us with 
shame and sorrow."The report said Catholic officials failed to tackle the widespread 
abuse, which ranged from "unwanted sexual advances" to serious sex abuse, in 
an attempt to prevent scandals.The investigation followed allegations of repeated incidents of 
abuse at one cloister that quickly spread to claims from Catholic institutions 
across the country, echoing similar church-related scandals around the world.The suspected number 
of abuse victims who spent some of their youth in church institutions 
likely lies somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, according to a summary of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">COUPEVILLE, Wash.  The 20-year-old "Barefoot Bandit" was sentenced Friday to more 
than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of charges.Colton 
Harris-Moore gained international notoriety while evading police across America in stolen planes, 
boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.Judge Vickie Churchill said "this 
case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of 
the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a 
"mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and 
contrite.Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington state counties. He 
has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be 
sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state 
and federal sentences at the same time.In a statement provided to Judge 
Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on 
his "darkest enemies."Still, he said he takes
 killed for struggling to win the land for the villagers. We all 
cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac 
failure.Problems in Wukan erupted in violence in September, when hund
n opposition Social Democrats' general secretary, Andrea Nahles, said the euro fund 
ballot showed that "the FDP's grass roots are deeply divided on the 
government's course.""The FDP's days of chaos are far from over," she predicted.
