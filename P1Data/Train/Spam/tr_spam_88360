BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t

a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau 
for Statistics, 29 percent of the Dutch population of 16 million identified 
themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the 
country.
awmakers were shard at work trying to come up with a compromise 
on the payroll tax cut. But with the usual partisan acrimony giving 
way to flashes of cooperation Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 
stressed that he wanted to give negotiators room to talk without trying 
to "prejudge" their proposal.Gone was the kind of definitive language President Obama 
used last week when he declared "I will reject" any attempt to 
tie the Keystone pipeline issue to his proposed payroll tax cut."I'm not 
going to get ahead of the process," Carney said Friday, when asked 
whether Obama could accept a package that extends the payroll tax cut 
but also includes Keystone pipeline language.Republicans want Congress to preserve the provision, 
which would speed up the process for the Keystone XL pipeline. The

 choose between two of the party's core constituencies: environmentalists who oppose Keystone 
and some unions who covet the jobs it would produce.But McConnell and 
other Republicans say the project would create thousands of jobs. The company's 
developer, TransCanada, says it could produce up to 20,000 jobs, while critics 
say the figure would be fewer than 3,500, including less than 1,000 
that would be permanent.After passing the catchall spending bill House leaders sent 
their members home until Monday or later, planning to return when the 
Senate produces a payroll tax cut measure for the House to vote 
on.The way was smoother for the compromise spending bill, which passed on 
a 296-121 vote. It would fund 10 Cabinet-level departments, such as the 
Pentagon and the Department of Education, and dozens of smaller agencies. It

is so fragile that this may be the last opportunity for the

Dec. 15, to the Discovery Times Square exhibit, The Dead Sea Scrolls: 
Life and Faith in Biblical Times," where it will be on display 
only until Jan. 2. After that, it will be returned to a
