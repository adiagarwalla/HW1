lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
 arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w

that the psychiatrist hired by Connecticut found that my client could not 
conform his actions to the law," attorney Richard Brown told reporters after 
the verdict was read.Daniel Jinich, the victim's father, did not comment on 
the verdict but, in a statement, expressed thanks to the prosecutors, Wesleyan 
University and others for their support and sympathy. Wesleyan students and staff 
who attended the trial declined to comment.During the trial, Madelon Baranoski, a 
forensic psychologist and Yale University professor, testified that Morgan suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia. She said he has delusional thoughts that include prison guards reading 
his mind, video of his thoughts being shown to his family, and 
fellow inmates monitoring him from strategic locations.She said Morgan's mental illness wouldn't 
be immediately apparent to others.Morgan apparently met Justin-Jinich at New York University

people started lining up hours in advance.The tradition was started 30 years 
ago -- with $10 bills -- by the late Msgr. Charles Bert 
Woodrich, who was known as Father Woody. He wanted to make sure 
homeless people got to celebrate Christmas too.Children in line will get McDonald's 
gift certificates.Click here for more good news stories.
 APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
e inmates are running the asylum or the Center for American Progress 
has made a decision to be anti-Israel."The CAP subsequently denounced the use 
of the term "Israel firsters."In a Dec. 9 blog, ThinkProgress National Security 
Editor Ben Armbruster said the organization does not "endorse the term."Zaid Jilani, 
the ThinkProgress reporter who used the term on Twitter, told Commentary magazine 
he was "unaware of all the connotations it carried." He apologized and 
deleted the tweets.The CAP has rejected any suggestion that it is anti-Semitic 
or anti-Israel, and it has fired back at Block and the Washington 
Post's Jennifer Rubin, who has written about the dispute. Armbruster called on 
the Post to retract Rubin's charge that some of the views espoused 
by CAP and Media Matters writers are anti-Semitic.The CAP also responded to 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center's statement, saying that, contrary to the center's suggestion,
