A new budget report released Tuesday predicts the U.S. government will run 
a $1.1 trillion deficit in the fiscal year that ends in September, 
the fourth year in a row over $1 trillion, though a slight 
dip from last year.The Congressional Budget Office report also says that annual 
deficits will remain in the $1 trillion range for the next several 
years if Bush-era tax cuts slated to expire in December are extended, 
as commonly assumed.The report is yet another reminder of the perilous fiscal 
situation the government is in, but it is commonly assumed that President 
Barack Obama and lawmakers in Congress that little will be accomplished on 
the deficit issue during an election year.The first wave of statements from 
lawmakers had a familiar ring as each party cast blame on the 
other."Four straight years of trillion-dollar deficits, no credible plan to lift the 
crushing burden of debt," said House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a 
Republican. "The president an
PHILADELPHIA  Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, the retired head of the Archdiocese of 
Philadelphia and an uncharged central figure in a child sex-abuse case that 
involves the alleged shuffling of predator priests to unwitting parishes, has died. 
He was 88.Bevilacqua died in his sleep Tuesday night   days 
after lawyers battled over his competence to testify at an upcoming trial 
   at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in the Philadelphia suburb 
of Wynnewood after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon law, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese.In the days before his death, a 
Philadelphia judge had ruled him competent to testify if 
seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia

headquarters.According to WJBK-TV, Gentz walked into the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department 
at about 4:30 a.m. local time Tuesday and told officers that the 
woman was murdered in her garage and that he helped dispose of 
her body.Police can hold Gentz for up to 72 hours without arresting 
him. A Wayne County prosecutor said Tuesday that no warrants were submitted 
for any arrests in the case.Bob Bashara failed a polygraph test administered 
Friday night, police said. The father of two hired well-known defense attorney 
David Griem, who spoke to reporters after Jane Bashara's funeral Tuesday morning.He 
described Gentz as "very questionable" and added that Bob Bashara identified Gentz
