 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.

irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on
