Apologies if you are receiving this for a second time but some of our
regular collection addressees havent responded so we are making sure no one
is missing out .  We will be collecting discarded christmas trees again
this year for planting on the beach to protect the dunes.

We will be collecting from Wed 7th - please let me know if you have a tree
for us to collect.

THANK YOU if you have already responded.
