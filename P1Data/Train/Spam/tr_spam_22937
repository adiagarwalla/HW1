in this race -- $7 million came from labor, according to the 
latest financial disclosures. The Democratic Governor's Association is also weighing in though 
they are sly about it. They contribute money to the Greater Wisconsin 
Political Fund, which produces some of the most negative ads of this 
campaign.However, Republican governors are weighing in through a PAC called Right Direction.As 
broadcast outlets profit and Wisconsin viewers are bombarded with partisan messages, even 
the chair of the State Democratic Party Mike Tate admits the party

and a lot of the money is from third party groups that 
we can't talk to at all."Mordecai Lee, professor of government affairs at 
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, says that is the new reality in politics.

 Two suicide car bombers strike in the northern city of Aleppo, 
Syria's largest, killing 28 people near a military intelligence building and the

the uprising, killing at least two people in the first suicide attack
