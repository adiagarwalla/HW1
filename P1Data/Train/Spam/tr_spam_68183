<p>-To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been given, was scarcely the work of a moment.-I cannot blame myself for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sister's being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss Bingley, but her brother is even yet ignorant of it.-That they might have met without ill consequence, is perhaps probable;-but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger.-Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me.-It is done, however, and it was done for the best.-On this subject I have nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your sister's feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not yet learnt to condemn them.-To convince him, therefore, that he had deceived himself, was no very difficult point.
