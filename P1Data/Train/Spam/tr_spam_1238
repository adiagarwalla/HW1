Drill
 To get into the Drill position, the receiver lies on their back and wraps their legs around their partner who mounts from above. Although it is very similar to the Missionary position, the raised legs make a significant improvement in the penetration angle as well as the intimacy of the position, making it a good first step for improving the sometimes http://www.help.lg.ua/karate monotonous starting position.
