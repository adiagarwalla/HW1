 or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
 ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
rassment complaint against Morgan for unwanted and insulting phone calls and emails, 
but ended up not pursuing criminal charges.At the trial, a police detective 
read aloud an email Justin-Jinich sent to Morgan in December 2008. She 
wrote: "I am so tired of you STALKING me. Leave me alone! 
... YOU are the type of person that women take self-defense classes 
to protect themselves against."A day before Justin-Jinich's email, Morgan wrote an email 
to her saying, "When you were upset about not communicating anymore, I 
thought it was because you needed me. But it was all stupid 
because I didn't have a clue what I was doing at the 
time."In her response, Justin-Jinich said she'd go to police if she ever 
saw him in person, and she would defend herself if necessary.She wrote: 
"I don't know what went wrong in your childhood or your adult 
life thus far to make you feel like you have some right 
to sexually harass me, to track me down on my various email 
accounts, to feel

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Several Democratic lawmakers and Jewish advocacy groups are calling on Republican Rep. 
Allen West to apologize after he invoked Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels in 
his criticism of Democrats.The Florida lawmaker cited the infamous Nazi leader when 
asked about a poll that showed Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats 
for gridlock in Washington."If Joseph Goebbels was around, he'd be very proud 
of the Democrat Party, because they have an incredible propaganda machine," West 
was quoted in Politico as saying.Though West is not backing down, the 
remark was quickly condemned by several advocacy groups, including the National Jewish 
Democratic Council.NJDC President David Harris urged West to apologize "immediately.""As we have 
said repeatedly, invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never 
acceptable and should be condemned by all for the sake of the 
memory of those who were lost," Harris said in a statement.Rep. Steve 
Israel, D-N.Y., chairman of 
 Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos
the parishes have asked them why have you come home, over 90 
percent of them have said 'because you invited me.'"There are 65 million 
Catholics in America. The number of parishes has decreased about 7 percent 
because of closings and mergers in the last 10 years, but, according 
to theCenter for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University, 
the number of Catholics has kept steady. That is in large part 
because of the growth of the nations Latino population. There has been 
a 40 percent increase in the number of Latino households registered, and 
Latinos now make up 291411f Catholics in the U.S.The Catholic Church 
currently faces many challenges, including competition from Protestant megachurches, an ever-increasing secular 
culture in America and the sexual abuse crisis that has shaken its 
clergy worldwide."The way the Catholic Church is right now," I would say 
they are in some ways too far from the real world. That's 
how I feel," a woman named</p>
