 accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
The following is a list of President Obama's "evolving" statements on same-sex 
marriage."I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such 
marriages." -- Obama's answer in a questionnaire during his 1996 run for 
Illinois state Senate "Undecided" -- his answer in another questionnaire on the 
same-sex marriage question during his re-election race for the same office in 
1998"I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am 
not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about 
primarily just as a strategic issue." -- Obama's response during an interview 
with the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper, in February 2004"I believe 
that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, 
for me as a Christian ... it is also a sacred union." 
-- Obama's response in April 2008 during a presidential campaign forum"I have 
been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily 
because of my understa

 "Super PACs and other third parties are really going to be able 
to define what an election is all about."A victory will be all 
about motivating the base to turn out. That is because the undecided 
vote in Wisconsin is so small; minds are made up and few 
are persuadable. The winning side is the one that gets the most 
supporters on their feet when Election Day rolls around. Republicans claim they 
have the advantage in that department and point to the highest turnout 
for a primary in 60 years. Though Walker was only up against 
a protest candidate on Tuesday, 626,538 Wisconsin Republicans cast a ballot to 
prevent a fluke. A spokesman for that party says that shows the 
state GOP has a better ground game than opponents on the left. 
Tate says Democrats will turn out when it means getting Walker out 
of office. "We are set up in great shape to with this, 
and on June 5 this is going to be a turnout fight, 
and I feel really good about our abilities to win," Tate said.	
May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She 
expressed to me concern that when she a
