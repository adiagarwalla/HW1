to Germany for treatment stands, saying that "we want Ms. Tymoshenko to

ssociated Press first reported on the failed bomb plot, which involved a 
sophisticated new type of explosive device, on Monday. Rogers said the information 
was leaked as far back as two weeks ago, though the story 
was held until this week.Information continues to stream out about the plot, 
with sources now saying the supposed bomber was actually a U.S. intelligence 
informant who infiltrated Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.But Rogers, aside from 
expressing concern that the Monday reporting halted an ongoing operation, questioned the 
veracity of some of the details still being reported about the operation 
-- without offering specifics. He said the leaks could challenge the U.S. 
relationship with its intelligence partners overseas."These leaks are dangerous and could lead 
to someone's death," he said.Rogers said he's conducting a "preliminary review," and 
questioned whether someone "may be trying to put this in a political 
narrative to help their politics."Other

would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r

response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it
