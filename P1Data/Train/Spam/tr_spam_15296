 ble on dealer lots.Businesses also ordered more big-ticket manufactured items in December, 
the government said last week. And orders for so-called core capital goods, 
which are a good measure of businesses' investment plans, reached an all-time 
high last month.Factory output rose in December by the most in a 
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Production rose for goods used in 
the early stages of manufacturing, such as metals, wood products and construction 
materials. That suggests the output of finished goods will pick up.Still, U.S. 
factories are vulnerable to economic shocks.Exports are likely to decline if Europe 
suffers a recession, as many predict.And the key reason the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months 
of last year was that companies restocked their warehouses. That kept helped 
drive factory output at the end of last year.Most economists say that 
restocking is certain to slow in the first quarter of this year.Unl
 il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be 
testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 31, 2012: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses a Security Council 
meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice --

 APJan. 29, 2012: Debris and wreckage lie along the highway after a 
multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near 
Gainesville, Fla. Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the pileup 
on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At 
least five cars and six tractor-trailers were involved, and some burst into 
flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office 
determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor-trailer as it traveled south early Sunday. The 
driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still not been identified.A 
dozen cars, six tractor-trailers and a motor home collided early Sunday shortl
."Never before has the government forced individuals and organizations to go out 
into the marketplace and buy a product that violates their conscience," Dolan 
said in a web video that takes the battle online. "This shouldn't 
happen in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in 
the Bill of Rights. How about letting our elected leaders know that 
we want religious liberty and rights of consciences restored and the administration's 
mandate rescinded? We can't afford to strike out on this one."Pressed on 
the matter at his daily briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney repeated several times the administration believes it struck an "appropriate balance" 
in crafting the policy."The administration believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate 
balance between respecting religious beliefs and increasing access to important preventive services," 
said Carney. "We will continue to work closely with religious groups during 
this transitional p
