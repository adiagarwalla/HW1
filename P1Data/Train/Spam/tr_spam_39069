 Grab Bag &mdash; Reuseable Shopping Bags That Clip To Your Cart
 </p>
 <p>
 Grab Bag is the reusable shopping bag that clips to your cart while shopping and keeps items secure while driving home, so your items won't spill in your trunk. Grab Bags are so versatile, you can even take them to the laundromat, dry cleaning, or use for storing toys or beach items. Grab Bags expand and hold what a regular shopping bag can't.
