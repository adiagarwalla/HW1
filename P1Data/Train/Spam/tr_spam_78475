statement issued by the Komen Foundation cited criteria for new grant-making and 
ensured there would be no gaps in its assistance."While it is regrettable 
when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such 
as a long-standing partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve 
to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most 
fully advance our mission," the statement said.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.
 APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

d plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. "shows that 
some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether
