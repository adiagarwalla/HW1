<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed

 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde
