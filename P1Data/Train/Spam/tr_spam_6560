ey light their homes."Upton said he was not opposed to the more 
efficient -- and expensive-- curlicue fluorescents that have become increasingly familiar in 
recent years. But he said government should not penalize those who prefer 
traditional, incandescent bulbs."New lighting options are great news for the public, but 
the lesson is that markets and consumer demand are the best drivers 
of innovation and new choices," Upton said.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the move would have little 
practical consequence, since it does not affect a 2007 law that requires 
manufacturers to produce or import more efficient bulbs. The five largest light 
bulb manufacturers have already switched to making and selling the more efficient 
bulbs, Bingaman said, so the enforcement delay only serves to confuse the 
public."Blocking funds to enforce minimum standards works against our nation getting the 
full benefits of energy efficien
Several Democratic lawmakers and Jewish advocacy groups are calling on Republican Rep. 
Allen West to apologize after he invoked Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels in 
his criticism of Democrats.The Florida lawmaker cited the infamous Nazi leader when 
asked about a poll that showed Americans blame Republicans more than Democrats 
for gridlock in Washington."If Joseph Goebbels was around, he'd be very proud 
of the Democrat Party, because they have an incredible propaganda machine," West 
was quoted in Politico as saying.Though West is not backing down, the 
remark was quickly condemned by several advocacy groups, including the National Jewish 
Democratic Council.NJDC President David Harris urged West to apologize "immediately.""As we have 
said repeatedly, invoking the Holocaust to make a political point is never 
acceptable and should be condemned by all for the sake of the 
memory of those who were lost," Harris said in a statement.Rep. Steve 
Israel, D-N.Y., chairman of

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system

the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were
University of East AngliaThe Climatic Research Unit, a key climate science facility 
at the School of Environmental Sciences, a part of the University of 
East Anglia in the UK.Are your tax dollars helping hide global warming 
data from the public? Internal emails leaked as part of Climategate 2.0 
indicate the answer may be "Yes."The original Climategate emails -- correspondence stolen 
from servers at a research facility in the U.K. and released on 
the Internet in late 2009 -- shook up the field of climate 
research. Now a new batch posted in late November to a Russian 
server shows that scientists at the University of East Anglias Climatic Research 
Unit refused to share their U.S. government-funded data with anyone they thought 
would disagree with them.Making that case in 2009, the then-head of the 
Research Unit, Dr. Phil Jones, told colleagues repeatedly that the U.S. Department 
of Energy was funding his data collection -- and that officials there 
agreed that he
