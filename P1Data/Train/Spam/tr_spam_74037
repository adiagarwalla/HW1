on went off, causing massive damage.Syrian TV showed shaken young girls in 
tears who said they were in the nearby Qazaz First Elementary School 
when the blast occurred. An hour after the blast, the school's gates 
were closed and no one was inside.The explosions left two craters at 
the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 
feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go 
to hospitals to donate blood."The house shook like it was an earthquake," 
housewife Maha Hijazi said as she stood outside her house across the 
street from the targeted compound, which is headquarters for a military intelligence 
department known as the Palestine Branch.The latest major explosion in the capital 
occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt 
near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and 
wounding 26.The previous deadliest att
The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee 
 ff the dinner with a contest in which supporters can register to 
win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop 
singer who is now a Broadway star. The fundraiser is for Obamas 
dedicated gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender coalition. Its hard to ask people 
to fork over $30,000 while simultaneously expl
g the slope as trees in its path were stripped bare.Family members, 
many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant
