Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But 11908637 tender meat and complex sauce compensated for 11908637 overly sweet bite. NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By 11908637 time 11908637 grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of 11908637 sweet dishes. But in fairness 11908637 "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, 11908637 sweet provides a gentle method for accepting 11908637 kick in many of 11908637 dishes.  There is a purpose behind 11908637 flavor selections. I appreciate 11908637 thoughtfulness behind 11908637 dishes.  What more could I ask? CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light. PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected. VERDICT: This was a lovely meal.
