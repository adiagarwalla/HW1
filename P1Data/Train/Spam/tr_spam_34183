AP Oprah Winfrey One of the stars of Oprah Winfreys struggling OWN 
Network is claiming that he is now homeless, broke and battling alcoholism 
-- and its all Winfreys fault.Star Magazine, via RadarOnline.com, reports that Robert 
Dupount, who stars on OWNs upcoming reality show Beverlys Full House, is 
telling friends that the former talk show titan ruined his life by 
having her network film his interactions with former supermodel Beverly Johnson.Robert is 
homeless now and he blames the show," a source told Star. He 
told me, Producers were egging on the drama. It took a toll 
on my relationship with Beverly.According to the source, things got so bad 
that Dupont had to move out of the house he was sharing 
with Johnson. Producers offered to pay his expenses through Jan. 1st, including 
putting him up at a Holiday Inn Express, but then they allegedly 
reneged on the offer and stuck Dupont with the bill.The source claims 
that Dupont, a recovering drug addict and alcohol
osed financial terms -- with Sylvester Stallone, after maintaining that he was 
the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the 
long history of lawsuits. But the publicity surrounding the lawsuits does 
e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl

Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers

generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's

said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in

Borgstrom told AP by telephone."I assume that the Supreme Court will rule 
that Assange should be extradited according to the European Arrest warrant. If 
not, you can scrap it," he said.In a hearing in London in 
February, Judge Howard Riddle had ruled that Assange can be extradited to 
Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he 
would not receive a fair trial there.Assange appealed to the High Court, 
and will now take his legal battle to the country's highest legal 
authority, the Supreme Court. The hearing will be his last avenue in 
Britain to avoid extradition, though lawyers have said they could consider a 
further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau

themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the 
country.
