<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I was dying to try this place after reading reviews, and it surely didn't disappoint. I'm not a huge fan of cheese, but I wanted to 1162423 give 'fancy cheeses' a shot, especially because all of the photos of the food looked so mouth-watering and delicious. Let's start with the setting. I love, love, love the garden in the back. If the weather is nice (like it has been in Philly for the past couple of days), definitely try to get a seat in the garden. You take this really mysterious passageway to the back of the restaurant where there's a small, cute space with a towering tree and adorable plants in pots along the walls and fences - very cutesy and very quaint. I loved it.

The food itself was quite tasty. 1162423 I ordered the omelet of the day, which included tomatoes and a goat-based cheese whose name I can't remember for the life of me. As I mentioned before, I'm not a huge fan of cheeses, but this one did pleasantly surprise me with its texture and flavor. Though, about halfway through the omelet, the cheesy taste was a little too much for me, so I passed it on and shared it with my friend (haha). The parmesan-lemon potatoes were AMAZING though. 53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea Such an amazing combination of flavors and probably one of the best breakfast/brunch potatoes that I've ever had. My friend ordered the Billy Penn Salad - doesn't look like too much food, but it is definitely filling. All of the veggies were super fresh, which made for a really appetizing looking plate. The meat on the dish (bacon & turkey) added an unexpectedly great texture to the entire dish. The dressing was nice since it wasn't too oily, and the blue cheese was strong, but not overwhelming and really tied the dish together.

The wait was somewhat long - 1162423 around 20-30 minutes to receive our dishes, but that wasn't terrible considering that it was a Saturday morning brunch trip. Servers were very generous and checked up on our table frequently, though not too much to be considered annoying. The food was pretty pricey considering the portions that you receive. Especially for a college student on a budget, eating here was definitely a treat and not a regular meal.

I had a wonderful experience at Wedge + Fig though and will definitely come back to bring my other brunch-loving friends. Especially recommend this place for those fancy cheese lovers - they have so many options, and they look super great if you're into cheese. Give this place a try - you won't regret it!53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea
