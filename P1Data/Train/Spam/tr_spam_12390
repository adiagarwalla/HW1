Invariably, any time a public official in Washington is asked about drones 
strikes over Pakistan, the answer is the same: "We are not able 
to discuss intelligence matters."But on Monday night all that changed when for 
the first time since taking office President Obama publicly acknowledged the deadly 
drone strike campaign waged on al Qaeda militants operating inside Pakistan and 
in the tribal regions along the Afghanistan border.During an online question-and-answer session 
sponsored by Google's new social media outlet, Google Plus, Obama surprised listeners 
with candid answers to a question about the C.I.A.'s worst kept secret: 
missile strikes inside Pakistan."So, obviously, a lot of these strikes have been 
in the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] and going after al Qaeda 
suspects who are up in very tough terrain along the border between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan," the president said.That was the statement that caught everyone's 
attention. The FATA is i
cing fashion. Romney lost in Iowa by a little and in South 
Carolina by a lot. But other than a couple of weeks when 
the Romneyites had visions of a January sweep, the frontrunners strategy had 
always been to hopscotch contests focusing on larger, more moderate states.So on 
the one hand, Romney is back on track. On the other hand, 
its a wholly different track than weve ever seen a Republican nominee 
follow before and with a very unpredictable GOP electorate.This isnt the NFL: 
you dont have to win all your playoff games to get to 
the Super Bowl. Romneys decisive drubbing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
in big, diverse and expensive Florida is the frontrunners strongest statement of 
dominance so far. Its also proof that while the Romney campaign has 
made some tactical errors in recent weeks, their overall strategy is holding 
up.But the truth is, we wont start to know until the end 
of this month whether Romney is making his strategy stick.There are a 
hand
. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after 
midnig

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
 ollowed by Rick Santorum with 13 percent and Ron Paul with 7 
percent.Romney won all 50 of Florida's convention delegates.With his Florida victory, Romney 
is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was 
initially declared the winner of the leadoff Iowa caucuses, but the Iowa 
GOP later called the race for Santorum. Romney scored a decisive victory 
in New Hampshire, but Gingrich answered back with a come-from-behind win in 
South Carolina.Gingrich has held a narrow lead in most recent national polls. 
But the results Tuesday mark a serious setback for the former House 
speaker, who was leading Romney in Florida polls as recently as last 
week.Gingrich, after dominating the debates in the run up to South Carolina, 
was more subdued on stage ahead of Florida, while Romney aggressively challenged 
Gingrich's attacks on his personal wealth and his immigration position. B
 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
