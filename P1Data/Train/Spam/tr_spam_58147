or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
"I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li

-- is nothing short of astonishing.It is part of what was a 
secret ancient library concealed in a series of 11 caves, now known 
as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The entire collection comprises approximately 900 different 
texts written in Greek, Aramaic and ancient Hebrew that were uncovered in 
the 1940s and '50s. The Ten Commandments scroll itself was found in 
Cave 4, where a majority of the documents were discovered."[Cave 4] was 
the motherload of the Dead Sea Scrolls," Kohn said.The only other copy 
of the Ten Commandments dating from around the same era is the 
Nash Papyrus. It's 50 to 100 years older than the scroll copy, 
but the Nash document does not contain all 10 commandments and is 
in extremely fragile fragments. The only other ancient records of the Commandments 
date from at least 1,000 years later.With its proscriptions against theft, murder 
and adultery, some people will note the irony of the Ten Command

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

 WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for 
the Overse
EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a
