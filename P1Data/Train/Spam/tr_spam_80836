I am surprised not getting a response from the earlier mail I sent to you.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
It is about my wish to present you as my demised client relative as both of you have the same family name to enable you inherit his estate.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I aided him in making an investment deposit some years ego with a bank. At his demise,i have been instructed to present any available member of his family to be paid the funds hence, my contacting you.</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
I wish to also inquire if it is possible to have different families with your same last name by coincidence, who do not share any common roots?</DIV>
<DIV>
&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>
Please acknowledge if your email is still valid to enable me explain more.</DIV>
<DIV>

<DIV>
Yours faithfully,</DIV>
