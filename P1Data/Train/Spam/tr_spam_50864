times.  9046766 creativity of flavors, 9046766 excellent execution, and 9046766 service was great.  Mesa is located just off 9046766 casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance. 9046766 flip side however is 9046766 feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of . 9046766 food is delicious.  We had 9046766 queso fundido, 9046766 chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall 9046766 last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off 9046766 plate. We felt 9046766 price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend. PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.  We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From 9046766 service, to 9046766 ambiance, to 9046766 food,
