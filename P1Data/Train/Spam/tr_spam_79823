my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for
