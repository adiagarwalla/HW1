Forbidden Fruit Sex Position
 Forbidden Fruit is a very intimate and sensual position as the receiver http://www.pizzoferrato.gov.it/orthography is totally exposed to the giver. The variety and intensity of oral pleasure possible in this position (cunnilingus and/or analingus) should quickly help overcome any initial embarrassment from being so exposed. The receiving partner lies on their front (knees up and out) with a pillow under their stomach while their partner kneels behind and between their legs. The position is especially erotic because the receiver cannot easily see what is about to happen and can be pleasantly surprised... again... and again!
