Suffering from thinning hair?

women and children and many of whom lived along river banks. Flood 
waters came gushing after 12 hours of pounding rain, catching most of 
them in their sleep.Residents told local officials that plans for a mass 
burial was "un-Christian," said Cagayan de Oro city administrator Griscelda Joson.Mayor Vicente 
Emano called a meeting later Monday to discuss the problem. Funeral parlors 
have asked authorities to do something about the unclaimed bodies because of 
the stench and complaints from neighbors, she said.More bodies continue to be 
found. While city officials were meeting Sunday, more than 40 bodies were 
seen floating off an island but the coast guard could not recover 
them, Joson said.In a grim sign of desperation, a funeral parlor dumped 
about 30 badly decomposed bodies in a city garbage dump over the 
weekend, sparking protests from distraught villagers who were looking for the missing 
loved ones.Ramos, the head of the agency that is spearheading the recovery a
t contact with its controllers and landed inside Iranian borders relatively intact.What 
appears to be an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report on drone 
warfare, posted on a website, found that communications links are a "primary 
target of the adversary" in robotic aircraft operations.The April 2011 report added: 
"Small, simple GPS  jammers can be easily constructed and employed by 
an unsophisticated adversary and would be effective over a limited RPA (remotely 
piloted aircraft) operating area," the report said.The website, Public Intelligence, describes itself 
as an international consortium of independent researchers dedicated to providing access open-source 
intelligence materials. Some independent U.S. experts confirmed that the document accurately describes 
a well-known potential vulnerability in drones.But Ted Beneigh, an expert on unmanned 
aircraft systems at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said it was "highly 
unlikely" that the Iran
 were sliding down. I thought I could fight my way back 
up to being in the top three or four," said Gingrich, now 
a front-runner for the nomination. "But I think positive ideas and positive 
solutions... have attracted people. I think they like the idea of someone 
who's determined to be positive."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
 Chipwrecked" did even worse than "Holmes." "Chipwrecked" opened at No. 2 with 
$23.5 million, about half the business the first two "Chipmunks" movies did 
on their debut weekends.The studio had expected a bigger debut, but with 
schools shutting down for the holidays, Fox executives hope business will pick 
up."We are battling a marketplace issue right now," said Chris Aronson, head 
of distribution for 20th Century Fox. "We cannot make light of that. 
However, we have a very satisfying, playable movie and the only G-rated 
movie for Christmas. So as kids get out this week, this is 
going to help position it for a successful run."Tom Cruise and Paramount 
had a spot of good news. Their action sequel "Mission: Impossible -- 
Ghost Protocol" got off to a healthy start at No. 3 with 
a $13 million weekend playing exclusively at huge-screen IMAX theaters and some 
other large-format cinemas."Ghost Protocol" goes into general release Wednesday.With critics praising the

The Second Mile fundraisers.Paterno, 84, led Penn State football for more than 
45 years until early November, when the sexual abuse charges against Sandusky 
shook the entire university and claimed the jobs of major college football's 
winningest coach and the school's president, Graham Spanier.Now, with The Second Mile's 
future in doubt, it is unclear whether Raykovitz properly handled the charity's 
response to the 2002 case.Penn State athletic director Tim Curley testified that 
a graduate assistant had told him in 2002 only that he had 
seen "inappropriate conduct" that made him feel uncomfortable, and nothing of a 
sexual nature. But Mike McQueary, now an assistant coach, testified to the 
grand jury that he told Curley he saw what he believed to 
be Sandusky raping the boy, who he said was about 10.Curley, who 
has been charged with perjury and failure to report a sex crime, 
testified he told Raykovitz of inappropriate conduct and that Sandusky was prohibited
