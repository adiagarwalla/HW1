The Fantastic Rocking Horse 


Allison says that when a woman is on top, she is more likely to hit that Big O. But 
especially, she says, when she angles her body towards her partner. 

 The Fantastic Rocking Horse is a good example of an orgasm increasing position.

 For this position your man can either cross his legs or put them out in front http://www.internethaber24.com/linden of 
him. He then leans back, while you climb on top of him, put your thighs around 
him, and lower yourself down (and up, and down, and up again, you get the 
idea...)
