		 back and send all of our Vegas friends. First of all it was awesome to be able to eat at one of Bobby's Flay's restaurants. Secondly, the restuarant did NOT dissapoint.  What we ordered: 1. tuna tartare nachos- the tuna was so incredibly fresh. The sauces and chips that accompanied the dish were so flavorful.  Only complaint is that the tuna seemed a tad bland.. like it needed to be accompanied with avocado chunks or a little more seasoning to break up the texture of the big chuck pieces of tuna. 2. chicken tacos- that peanut BBQ sauce was HEAVENLY. The grilled red onions were perfection. I would definitely order this again and would love to learn how to make that peanut sauce at home. 3. the shrimp corm tamale- honestly, it was good but not amazing. The corn pieces were so sweet and plump, one of the best corn I have ever had but the tamale itself wasnt that great. 4. Lamp Chops- AMAZING, OUSTANDING, INCREDIBLE. One of the best lamp chops I have ever had. I highly reccomend them. 5. Filet Mignon with Coffee Rub- Such an amazing combination. The flavor of coffee with high quality meat just melts in your mouth. Such cool flavors. Such a nice feeling when you think to yourself that you have never tasted anything like this before. We also ordered the mashed potatoes to accompany this dish and those were just heaven. Creamy, buttery goodness. Very nice romantic meal in Vegas with the boo. I would definitely like to come back here. mesa grill seriously just put the icing on the cake and made this Vegas trip the best one yet. I am a total food network junkie and ALWAYS drool over bobby flay's food since it's right up my alley [love spicy and bold flavors]. was going to come here last year but never got the chance, so Paul and I were determined to make it this time. we came during brunch and without a reservation, only a 20 minute wait.   the interior is nice, as expected. I opted for the spicy scrambled eggs and Paul absolutely had to have the burger. you get this amazing ass bread basket with mini jalapeno cheddar biscuits , mini scones, and blue corn muffins. I had to stop myself from filling up on it. on to the food! my eggs were perfect. tons of fresh jalapenos and a drizzle of some light green sauce, and goat cheese. the goat cheese was the perfect creamy accompaniment to the spicy jalapenos. love the fact it was actually spicy, as
