tarted sinking in the choppy water.One of the survivors, Sergei Grauman, said 
on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia 
is the world's largest natural gas exporter and second-largest oil export
negotiations, providing food aid as an incentive to the starving nation. Officials 
who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Kim's 
death would likely delay the effort.With Kim's death, the U.S. is also 
in the position of seeking to reassure China that a security commitment 
with South Korea is not a threat to the North's lone ally. 
China had been expected to host talks on Thursday in Beijing between 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats about restarting nuclear disarmament efforts. That meeting 
in turn could lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that 
would also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The food aid had 
been seen as an incentive to get North Korea to the table, 
In exchange, the North would agree to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment 
program, which would lead to six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, the 
U.S. and North and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and
State governments across the country have cut more than 80,000 jobs since 
the beginning of the recession, reflecting steep drops in tax revenue and 
providing a drag on the economies in many parts of the country, 
the Associated Press has found.Data collected by AP reporters in all 50 
states show the number of government employees has declined along with per-capita 
general fund spending. The national average of state employees per 1,000 people 
has dropped from 8.1 to 7.6, thanks to layoffs and hiring freezes 
since the 2007-08 budget year.State workers have been at the center of 
some of the most heated debates this year over the appropriate size 
and scope of government. Those debates will resume in 2012, especially as 
many states continue to struggle with budget deficits and seek to reform 
public pension benefits.General fund spending has rebounded beyond pre-recession levels in 24 
states, but the remaining 26 are still a collective $42 billion lower 
compared wit

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">vember 2008 that Sandusky had been spoken to about getting "too close" 
to children involved with the charity. Gerald Rosamilia said Raykovitz's wife, Katherine 
Genovese, who helped run The Second Mile, did not define what was 
meant by "too close" or give a timeframe.Raykovitz defended himself in a 
telephone interview, saying he acted appropriately at all times. "There have always 
been steps in place to protect kids," he said.The grand jury that 
charged Sandusky with 52 sexual abuse-related counts involving 10 boys said the 
former coach "found his victims" through The Second Mile and committed many 
of his offenses inside Penn State football buildings.The nonprofit had thrived since 
its creation in 1977 because of Sandusky's prominence as a defensive coach 
at Penn State, its close ties to university donors and leaders, and 
its use of Penn State's athletic fields for its camps serving at-risk 
children. Then-coach Joe Paterno often served as master of ceremonies at 
 ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating 
the system.As the nation heads into the 
om MS."Probably the toughest time in my life was standing there with 
Ann as we hugged each other and the diagnosis came," Romney said. 
"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling, 
and he stepped out of the room and we stood up and 
hugged each other," he said.Romney said that wife, whom he met when 
she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school, 
had no energy, couldn't climb the stairs in the house and couldn't 
make dinner. They were trying to find solutions to make her day-to-day 
activities easier to manage, he said, but she was most concerned about 
not being able to take care of her family."I said, look, I 
don't care what the meals are like. You know, I like cold
