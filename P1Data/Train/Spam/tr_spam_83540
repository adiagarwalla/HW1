 LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to
 reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to
hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving 
heart for people. He was

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  A majority of Americans think President Obama should be voted 
out of office next year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The 
poll contained troubling signs for the incumbent as he prepares for a 
grueling reelection campaign. While Americans were evenly divided on whether they expect 
the president to earn a second term, most of those polled said 
he does not deserve one.For the first time, the poll found that 
a majority of adults, 52 percent, said Obama should be voted out 
of office while 43 percent said he deserves another termObama's overall job 
approval stands at a new low: 44 percent approve while 54 percent 
disapprove. The president's standing among independents is worse: 38 percent approve while 
59 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, the president holds steady with an approval 
rating of 78 percent while only 12 percent of Republicans approve of 
the job he's doing.Obama's overall poll numbers suggest he is in jeopardy 
of losing, even
 AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior 
U.S. offici
"It is stressful for my clients that there is yet another extension," 
Borgstrom told AP by telephone."I assume that the Supreme Court will rule 
that Assange should be extradited according to the European Arrest warrant. If 
not, you can scrap it," he said.In a hearing in London in 
February, Judge Howard Riddle had ruled that Assange can be extradited to 
Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he 
would not receive a fair trial there.Assange appealed to the High Court, 
and will now take his legal battle to the country's highest legal 
authority, the Supreme Court. The hearing will be his last avenue in 
Britain to avoid extradition, though lawyers have said they could consider a 
further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
