is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said,

Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">o State. But Haley said Romney's experience in the private and public 
sectors proves he can deal "with a broken Washington."Romney also released a 
TV ad in South Carolina touting his leadership attributes."I think people understand 
that I'm a man of steadiness and constancy," Romney says in the 
ad, which has already run in Iowa and New Hampshire -- a 
state critical to Romney's early primary strategy.How much Haley's endorsement will matter 
in South Carolina, however, is unclear.South Carolina is a difficult state for 
Romney; he competed aggressively there when he first ran for president in 
2008 only to bail shortly before the primary when it became clear 
that he would get crushed after to failing to ease voter concerns 
about his Mormon faith and his reversals on social issues.At the debate 
Thursday, Romney stuck mostly to his record as an executive with much-needed 
economic experience.Gingrich, though, was put on the defensive over his decades in 
Washington, h
 AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families

APJune 15, 2011: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen with his ankle 
security tag at the house where he is required to stay in, 
near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish 
prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning -- 
are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to 
order extraditions.Ear
