Let me join the literal thousands 1302118 and talk about what an incredible bakery this is.  I grew up in L.A County but only now that I'm in San Diego do I discover this place!  A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine who travels up to L.A. almost every weekend brought back Porto's.  She told  me to try one of the pastries and I really wasn't in the mood for anything like that, but went ahead and tried the cheese Danish.  WOW!  I could not believe the freshness and flavor, unlike any pastry I had ever had before.  And when I had tried this, they were at least a couple of days old.  The pastries were so incredible I had to make a special trip up myself to try this place out in person.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Come on guys. Why are you even reading this review? 
This place is fannnntastic! 1302118 Near perfect review with fast service and affordable prices!
Ill just cut to the chase and tell you my favorites. 

Potato Balls- This is quite possibly my favorite way of taking in carbs. 1302118 The potato balls are basically ground beef wrapped in mashed potato goodness and fried in heaven. I love them so much. T_T

Cappuccino Mousse- 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb This delicious treat is to die for if you want some coffee dessert. The mousse isn't too heavy and it is not too sweet. You can eat the beans on top if you life that, but if you haven't done that before, you probably won't want to eat the coffee beans.

Tiramasu Cake- I love buying this cake for people! 1302118 They have an express lane for just cakes which is great (you can also pre order your cake). This is a white cake (that tastes very lightly of coffee) with marscapone cheese mousse. The outside is decorated with lady fingers and also has this lovely chocolate molding type thing on top. It's perfect because when you cut the cake, the chocolate crumbles and it becomes more of a chocolate shaving. Lovely!

Papa Preparada- Soooo... 1302118 I think I've made it pretty clear that I like potato balls... so imagine my surprise when I discovered there was a POTATO BALL SANDWICH. So amazing. The sandwich also has swiss cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and some condiments inside of a cuban loaf of bread. Sometimes I'll take this to go and drown it in sriracha when I get home. This is just so good with a kick to it.

Anywho, I only picked a few things 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb there because I could go on forever about how much I love their goods. Not to mention, their menu is so huge it's difficult to try everything (especially when you're a creature of habit).

Here is the ONLY problematic thing about this location, parking. 1302118 If you are coming south on Brand, start looking for parking as soon as you pass Lexington. If there is no street parking, make a right at the next corner (California) and the first drive way you see will lead to the back parking lot for Portos. BRING QUARTERS! 50 cents will buy you half an hour, which is all you really need. They will get you in and you! If you miss that drive way, no worries, the next corner you make a right on, will also take you to their parking lot. Just be warned, parking is difficult to find here, especially during the holidays! Be patient! The food is worth it!.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb
