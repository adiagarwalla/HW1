erm, citing Harris-Moore's bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an 
alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out 
the details of his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with 
the court.Harris-Moore's first conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession 
of stolen property, and according to the reports, his first experience with 
burglary came when he broke into the homes of his classmates to 
steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income 
on beer and cigarettes -- something she has denied.Over the next three 
years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among 
other crimes. At one point he was arrested when a detective posed 
as a pizza-delivery driver.In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years 
in a juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in 
Island County. But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and 
was soon back to
 his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food and 
sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic 
stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. 
Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.Waves 
of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his 
Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after 
stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second time, Harris-Moore 
left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under a running 
faucet.He took cash and a tray of croissants, and Ater's insuran
or more good news stories.

areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.

blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa
