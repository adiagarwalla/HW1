<p style="font-size:xx-small;">WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t
 Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
 olding against a backdrop of worries by Republicans and Democrats that the 
nation's defenses will suffer if lawmakers cannot stave off more than $500 
billion in mandatory military spending cuts scled to begin taking effect next 
year.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Force Base in Dover, Del. On Wednesday, May 9, 2012, a House
