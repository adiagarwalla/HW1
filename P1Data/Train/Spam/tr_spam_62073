 la imprimais o la leai
s con vuestro ordenador, aumentandola si hace falta. Al principio crei que=20=

poner un link a una imagen en flickr serviria para que esta web mostrara la =
imagen en si, pero parece que no es asi.

Crotalito, te gusta el aceite de oliva? Lo pagas caro? Lo usais mucho en la =
cocina.

Yo naci en Jaen, donde el 96que luego seran aceite. Producimos el 60de oliva.

El poema es de Miguel Hernandez.
