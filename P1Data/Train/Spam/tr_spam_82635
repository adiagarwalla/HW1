ld everyone involved in the fiesta has received specific marching orders: anything 
Spears wants, Spears gets.Britney Spears Turns 30!?Britney Spears has been a pop 
culture icon since she was a teenager.
ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread 
word o
WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
attorney for Doby and that an extradition hearing hadn't been scled.A not-guilty 
plea was entered on Crain's behalf during her arraignment Thursday in Pottawatomie 
County. Her attorney, Cregg Webb, did not return a phone message Friday 
left at his office in Shawnee.Smothermon said he's also discussing the possibility 
of federal charges, but that Oklahoma statutes carry lengthier sentences."We want to 
make sure we can get the maximum amount of time that we 
can," he said.The case first came to light in November when the 
parents of a 9-year-old girl contacted police after their daughter attended a 
pizza party at Crain's McLoud home. The girl told police Crain had 
several girls change into Christmas-themed bras and panties and then took pictures 
of them decorating a Christmas tree and made a video of them 
doing a cheer dance, according to a police affidavit.Police later uncovered more 
than 100 sexually explicit photographs of young girls from Crain's cellphone,
