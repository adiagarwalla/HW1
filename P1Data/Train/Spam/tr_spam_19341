I like that they have different flavors of crepe 24510489 and you can choose everything that goes on it. But my crepe took about ten minutes wait time although there was no one else there. The scoop of ice cream they put in my crepe was about a spoonful. I wanted a whole scoop! They put five slices of strawberry on my crepe and the whole thing was around 5 dollars. I didn't think it was worth it. The earl grey crepe wasn't that great or special in any way, the texture was a little soft for my taste. I was really disappointed.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Came by here last Thursday with my husband and my cousin since we were walking around Rodeo Drive. 24510489 It was rather warm out and remembered that I had bookmarked this place and thought we should check this place out. 

This place is located right next to a hair salon, 24510489 Vidal Sassoon, and is smaller than I had expected it to be. But aside from the tiny place and limited seating (3 small tables, 1 couch) the crepes are pretty good here. I remember the reason why I had bookmarked this place in the first place was because of the cute animals made out of an ice cream scoop, but I was disappointed that my crepe did not have a cute little animal looking back at me.

Anyways, this is what my husband and I ordered:

Chocolate batter with sliced bananas and coffee ice cream: 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 This rolled up crepe was delicious and perfect for the warm afternoon we had walking around. It was rather messy though to eat. The crepe itself was made well and had that nice chocolate taste. I am not a fan of coffee ice cream so I didn't really eat much of this, but my husband really enjoyed this.

Earl grey batter with mochi. 24510489 Nutella syrup and black sesame ice cream: I really like Earl Grey tea and thought an Earl Grey flavored crepe would be a nice complementary taste with my choosing. The mochi were pretty filling in this crepe, and only got 3 pieces in the crepe, but at least they were a fair size instead of those tiny pieces you would get in shaved ice places. The Earl Grey crepe was subtle but in a good way. I also really love black sesame ice cream so it was wonderful with everything, including the Nutella syrup. And again, a messy thing to eat.

You can also pick a savory crepe in case you are not up for dessert. You can also get a cup of tea or coffee here as well. 

Wait time was not too long at all and there were 24510489 3 other people there when we arrived (sometime after 12 pm) but those other people had already got the items they ordered so that probably helped lessen our wait time. Wished there was wifi here. Not too sure if there is a restroom here, as I did not ask or see one. The chandelier is a nice fancy touch.

Overall, I would definitely come back here if I was in the area again. By the way, parking is just street (metered). But if you are willing to walk, you can park in one of the lots at Rodeo Drive with the 90 minute free parking and walk over.197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33
