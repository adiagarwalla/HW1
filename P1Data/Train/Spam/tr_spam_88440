ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
.Campaigning will continue into next week, with Gingrich also planning to spend 
the early part of the week in Iowa. He'll head to New 
Hampshire Wednesday, where Romney will already be part way through a four-day 
bus tour. Romney won't return to Iowa until after Christmas.His confidence increasing, 
Romney has stepped away from his aggressive attacks on Gingrich in recent 
days, instead shifting his focus back to Obama -- and working to 
humanize himself on the campaign trail. That focus was on display in 
Sunday's interview, when Romney spoke emotionally about his wife's struggle with multiple 
sclerosis.He said the "toughest time" in his life was standing in the 
doctor's office waiting for her diagnosis. He said he feared she had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal degenerative 
nerve condition.The doctor "did these neurological tests, and then he -- and 
we could see that she had real balance problems and she didn't 
have f
 start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the 
House with their latest made-up crisis just days before Ch

should be used for are far less clear, because the study asserts 
that they need to be made up and codified as EPA goes 
along.EPA needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability, the 
study says. Vision, in the sense discussed here, is a future state 
that EPA is trying to reach or is trying to help the 
country or the world to reach.The study offers up new tools for 
EPA to do the job. As opposed to environmental impact assessment, the 
study encourages the use of sustainability impact assessment in the evaluation of 
the hundreds and thousands of projects that come under EPA scrutiny to 
see whether they are moving in the proper directionEnvironmental impact assessment tends

volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said."Twitter is 
growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail 
Patel, who follows digital media in the region for the research firm 
Informa Telecoms &amp; Media. "The Middle East is an important region for 
Twitter. And Twitter is becoming increasingly important for all Middle East residents

Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin

$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted

around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks
