ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra
llion people.Extended benefits for long-term jobless people will also expire Jan. 1 
without congressional action.That same day, a 27 percent cut in Medicare reimbursements 
to doctors would take effect unless lawmakers act, a ction that could 
convince some doctors to stop treating Medicare patients.Obama and congressional Democrats have 
proposed dropping next year's payroll tax rate to 3.1 percent, but an 
extension of this year's 4.2 percent rate seems likely to prevail. The 
payroll tax is the major source of financing for Social Security.Obama also 
wants to leave in place the current maximum of 99 weeks of 
benefits for the long-term unemployed. A payroll tax cut bill approved by 
the House ces that total by 20 weeks, which the administration says 
would cut off 3.3 million individuals. Democrats are hoping to soften if 
not reverse what's in the House version.Even without the Keystone pipeline dispute, 
bargainers had still not reached agreement on how to ex
e suffering from severely dry skin fighting overseas to local Maryland nail 
salons.You can send a care package of cream soap or lip balm 
to a loved one or even a stranger who is deployed complete 
with a personal note from Sarah and free shipping.If its in high 
demand from our troops oversees, it is probably a product worth looking 
into.Click here for more good news stories.Click here to read more on 
this from MyFoxDC.Do you love the USA as much as we do? 
Let freedom ring and tell us what makes you proud to be 
American by sending us your photos and videos.

making such programs more accessible, coordinated and more effective. Providing professional development 
for teachers and creating ways to assess thecation level of kids 
entering kindergarten were among the areas states were asked to focus on 
in their application.Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary 
Kathleen Sebelius were to announce the winners at the White House. The 
two agencies jointly administered the competition. HHS oversees the federal Head Start 
program, which provides earlycation to nearly 1 million low-income children.Last month, 
Obama announced new rules that require lower-performing Head Start programs to compete 
for funding. The Education Department also has proposed creating a new office 
to oversee the grants and better coordinate early learning programs.Click here to

 BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the 
rights
 tend a payroll tax cut through 2012, with major disagreements remaining over 
how to finance the package.The spending bill advanced after Democrats blocked a 
series of GOP assaults on Environmental Protection Agency regulations, though the agency's 
budget absorbed a cut of more than 3 percent.GOP leaders did succeed 
in delays in regulations of coal dust and eliminating federal funding of 
needle exchange programs.War costs would be $115 billion, a $43 billion cut 
from the previous year.
