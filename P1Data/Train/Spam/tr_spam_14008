It was not my best experience. 20965503 The decorations were very nice and did seem to reflect the authenticity of Mexico but the food did not. I tried the torta, the Chicago burrito, the flan and two tacos of al pastor and carnitas. Overall the meat was bland and the prices are seriously exaggerated. I mean it wasn't bad but it was not the greatest. I would not recommend it to anyone. I am originally from California where the true Mexican food is & I am Mexican and have been eating real Mexican food all my life, this place is just not up to par. I won't be coming back..8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">The Capital Grille has been on my "Absolutely HAVE 20965503 to Try" list ever since an epic Elite Event that was held there in 2012. And I finally got my chance to check them out during Dine Out Boston 2014. Took me long enough, right?

I went for an early dinner with fellow Yelper, 20965503 Nandanie S, and had a fantastic meal from start to finish. Service was superb, very friendly and professional. After a very brief wait, we were seated (we had arrived a minute or two early for our reservation). Three different smiling servers came over and asked if we would like water. We pointed this out to them and they joked that they really like to keep us hydrated! And do they ever - there wasn't a moment the entire night where my glass was anywhere near empty.

A bread basket came out next. 8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a Warm and freshly baked, my favorite was the onion roll, hands-down. But all of the bread was definitely put to good use when I ordered clam chowder for a starter. None of the appetizer options were all that exciting (the other two choices were salads), but my chowder was creamy, full of big clam chunks, and very, very good for bread dipping. Standard, but good.

For entrees, we both opted for the filet mignon. We were told that for $3 more, we could get the porcini rub as an add-on. 20965503 Our server was quite the salesman, and we were sold. Turns out it was an out-of-this-world great decision - it added a tasty kick to an already very flavorful piece of meat. And I don't think you need me to tell you that The Capital Grille does steak astoundingly well. Because you know that. I found myself getting full, but I just. Couldn't. Stop. Eating. It. Until it was gone, gone gone.

Accompaniments listed on the menu were mashed potatoes and French green beans with shallots and heirloom tomatoes, 20965503 which were served family style. The potatoes really filling and went great with my steak. The veggies? Ain't nobody got time for that (although they looked great)!

And finally... dessert. I went with the flourless chocolate espresso cake, which was really dense and really chocolatey. A great way to end the meal!

So, was it the best steak I've ever had? Nah. But it's definitely pretty high up there. And in terms of Restaurant Week meals (ahem, excuse me.... I mean Dine Out Boston), it was a roaring success.8991b1e3a2313c039489196ce83cdb0a
