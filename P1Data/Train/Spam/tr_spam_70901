had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! Wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  I ordered 18659564 pork sandwich and it came with a side of fries. 18659564 pork was well seasoned and juicy, 18659564 baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with 18659564 smokey heat of Ancho Chili peppers that Flay has built an empire on! Oh and 18659564 herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. So why only 3 stars? Honestly, it was A-OK, 18659564 food excellent and tasty, 18659564 service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... That feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... Would I return, yes! Should you, definitely! But, maybe for dinner. I'm so shocked.  I visited here in 2008 and 18659564 food was so great that I went back this past weekend on my visit to Vegas.  Totally different experience.  I was so disappointed.  1st off, 18659564 service was not a good as previously, perhaps they assigned 18659564 server with too many tables and my dish wasn't flavorful. I ordered 18659564 special, Grouper with Corn Cous Cous (see photo).  18659564 dish was beautiful and I was excited when it hit 18659564 table.  18659564 fish itself lacked seasoning and it wasn't cooked all 18659564 way through.  Once I got to 18659564 middle, I just put down my fork.  Sorry, Bobby, won't be back. Can I just say that Bobby Flay is a genius?! Bobby, how do you manage
