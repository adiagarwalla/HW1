<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I was in town for business and met a friend for dinner. I should mention, I worked in a restaurant for 5 yrs, am a foodie and take my reviews seriously. 9466460 My friend, is culinary schoolcated and has been a chef for 11 years. We know service and we know food. 

This was my first time at Cowfish after hearing rave reviews from my friend if their burger rolls aka "burguishi".

The restaurant was busy and no seats 9466460 were available at the bar. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. While people watching we saw a few patrons with children which was off-putting. I honestly would not bring a child here unless they were over the age of 10. It's just not the appeasable scene. 

We were seated by the manager whose 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e friendly candor was very much welcomed by me & my friend. I wish I remember his name, but he is the type of person that gives you a good impression and gets you excited. 

Unfortunately, our assigned waiter was far from savvy as the manager we met. The waiter appeared rushed. 9466460 So much so that in his haste he failed to listen each and every time. I requested hot green tea. He informed me they don't have green tea, but a citrus one and mumbled. It wasn't until he left that I realized he was gonna bring me iced tea. NOTE: A hot tea patron and an iced tea patron are two different classes of patrons. When he returned with the ICED tea, I informed him that my intent was for a hot tea... He directed me to the page FULL of hot tea options. My friend took the iced tea as he had initially ordered water and I drank the hot. At this point, I was NOT impressed by the waiter. My friend was not convinced my upset was valid.

I ignored that the waiter referred to the special rolls as "entree rolls" suggesting a single order would satisfy. 9466460 Two rolls per person is the standard, but there's no need to argue to someone who clearly was unfamiliar with the menu & the fate in general. We ordered our meals.

My friend wanted the large tuna roll that he has seen being ordered. The waiter unfamiliar with the menu or the popular items was unable to direct him and never asked his colleagues. My friend ordered a roll similar to what he thought was the popular one and modified it by switching the fish. He requested spicy tuna instead of salmon but was informed they only had tuna and spicy is via the mayo. :/ This is where this place began to lose my friend. I ordered as well. We previously ordered an appetizer which was very similar to Bonefish's bang bang shrimp.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
