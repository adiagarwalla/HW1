 (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme

vice president for policy, external affairs and communications at Pfizer Inc., a 
job that includes directing the pharmaceutical giant's government relations operations.California figured most 
prominently on Obama's roster of big money "bundlers." Sixteen are from California 
and 13 are from New York.Top fundraisers include movie producers Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and Harvey Weinstein, and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Actress Eva Longoria was 
in the second highest tier, bundling $200,000 to $500,000 for Obama's re-election.

our time, let's make sure the best candidate rises up," he said.He 
added that he went to Minnesota because the state's primary results matter."People 
are going to go out to vote. People are always looking at 
what the polls say. The best poll is folks you know in 
one of the most important states in the country in the general 
election is going to speak, and they're going to speak very loudly, 
and that's why I was in Minnesota."The strategy is not far from 
rival Ron Paul's, who is also concentrating his energy outside of Florida, 
appearing Tuesday in Ft. Collins, Colo., as well as Denver, where a 
raucous crowd cheered on the Texas congressman.Paul told Fox Business Network on 
Monday that he doesn't get the same media coverage as the other 
candidates because he doesn't represent the "status quo." Other times, his campaign 
gets coverage but the pundits mock it and say he is "too 
extreme.""Of course, we've

a breast cancer survivor, I applaud the decision made by the Komen 
Foundation to discontinue their partnership with the billion-dollar, abortion mega-provider, Planned Parenthood," 
Americans United for Life President and CEO Dr. Charmaine Yoest said."The work 
of the Komen Foundation has life-saving potential and should not be intertwined 
with an industry dealing in death."According to Planned Parenthood, its centers performed 
over 4 million breast exams in the past five years, almost 170,000 
of them paid for by Komen Foundation grants."We're kind of reeling," said 
Patrick Hurd, who is CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Virginia -- 
recipient of a 2010 grant from Komen. Hurd's wife, Betsi, is currently 
battling breast cancer."It sounds almost trite, going through this with Betsi, but

day in Washington, with Obama reaffirming U.S. support for Georgia's aspiring NATO 
membership, as well as talking up the possibility of a free trade 
deal."I can tell you we are incredibly grateful as a nation for 
continued support and strong ... cooperation that we'll be getting from your 
administration and from the United States of America at every level," Saakashvili 
said. He added Georgia is "grateful" for U.S. support on NATO membership 
and other issues.Georgia declared independence in 1991 after decades of Soviet rule. 
The country clashed again with Russia in 2008, in a dispute over 
two separatist regions. That clash came at the beginning of the 2008 
general election campaign between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain.McCain later 
tried to use Obama's response to that conflict against him, criticizing Obama 
for calling for "restraint" on behalf of Georgia. Obama, though, actually calle
