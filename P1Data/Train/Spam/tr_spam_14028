<p style="font-size:xx-small;">e dinner is expected to raise close to $15 million -- about 
$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic
