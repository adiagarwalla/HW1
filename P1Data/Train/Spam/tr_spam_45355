 his old tricks, breaking into unoccupied vacation homes, stealing food and 
sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic 
stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. 
Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.Waves 
of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his 
Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after 
stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second time, Harris-Moore 
left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under a running 
faucet.He took cash and a tray of croissants, and Ater's insuran
BRUSSELS -- European Union officials say that a first draft of a 
new treaty setting up tighter budget rules for eurozone countries has been 
sent to governments Friday.The officials said that formal discussions on the new 
treaty with delegates from the national governments will start next Tuesday, with 
a second round of talks scled for the first week of January. 
The officials declined to be named in line with the EU's briefing 
policy.The U.K., which was the only European country which has refused to 
sign up to the new intergovernmental treaty, will have observer status in 
the talks.The new rules will apply to eurozone states once nine of 
the 17 have ratified it, while participating non-euro states can decide whether 
they want to submit to the new rules.
 The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
 ht to visit Chen in the past, all unsuccessfully. Chen's case has 
also been raised publicly by U.S. congressmen and diplomats, including Secretary of 
State Hillary Rodham Clinton, all to no response from China.CNN said Bale 
first learned of Chen from news reports when he was in China 
filming "The Flowers of War," China's official submission for best foreign language 
film Oscar. It said he "reached out to CNN and invited us 
to join him on his journey to visit Chen."
reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to
