s questioned two wealthy supporters, Fred and Lisa Blue Baron, on why 
they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your 
enemies closer," P
The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn a parallel between Ukraine 
and its authoritarian neighbor Belarus, saying Thursday that people in those countries 
are still living under dictatorship and repression.Merkel's harsh words to Parliament about 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government came amid German efforts to ensure jailed 
former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko receives proper medical care. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment.Several Western governments have spoken out against the legal prosecution 
of Tymoshenko, saying the cases against her are politically motivated.The issue is 
threatening to turn soccer's European Championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland 
next month, into a political embarrassment.Some European officials have vowed to boycott 
matches held in Ukraine over the alleged mistreatment of TymoshenkoTymoshenko, 51, on 
Wednesday ended a nearly three-week hunger strike after being moved from jail 
to a hospi
 A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose 
the savings. We just need to cut the government spending in other 
places of government."But Democrats, who are pushing an alternative
