er when they discovered the first of what would become 10 homicide 
victims.Searchers found the latest set of bones at around 9:15 a.m. on 
Tuesday in a dense wetland thicket, about a half mile from where 
Gilbert disappeared after meeting a client for an early-morning sexual encounter.The remains 
were found by homicide detectives about a quarter mile from where authorities 
found the young woman's pants, shoes, pocketbook with ID and other personal 
items.Dormer suggested that Gilbert had become hopelessly entangled in the brush, which 
he called a "tough, desolate, tangled mess." He said police think Gilbert 
likely drowned accidentally after fleeing the client's home for an unclear reason 
and that her case is not connected to the serial killings.Authorities have 
not yet positively identified the latest set of skeletal remains. An autopsy 
is expected to take weeks, a police source told FoxNews.com.FoxNews.com's Cristina Corbin 
and the Associated Press contributed to 
AUSTIN, Tx.  Retired Lt. Gen. Ric Sanchez, the sole major Democratic 
candidate in the race to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
said Friday he is dropping out of the Texas race because of 
"pressing personal challenges" and a lack of funds.In an email to supporters 
Friday afternoon, Sanchez thanked those who had encouraged him to run but 
said he needed to put his family first."I am very grateful for 
the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters across the 
country and the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of 
our great state," Sanchez said. "However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the 
recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers 
make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time."While the 
Republican field to replace Hutchison is extremely crowded, Sanchez was the only 
major candidate from the Democratic party.Hutchison announced earlier this year that she

Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from the parking

him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.Fox bought the movie rights

Black, who won an Academy Award for writing the movie "Milk," about 
the gay rights activist Harvey Milk, is working on the screenplay. He's

according to Lance Rosen, Harris-Moore's entertainment lawyer.Harris-Moore doesn't get to keep any

 GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o

the screens while security officers are put through the paces. The guns 
feel real because they are.But instead of ammo, theyre outfitted with compressed 
air so they will they feel real when theyre shot. There are
