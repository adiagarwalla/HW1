ention Obama's comments on gay marriage during the debate, but Democrats did 
characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t
r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem 
 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

 e at least December 2009. That grand jury is examining the investigative 
work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.

nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
