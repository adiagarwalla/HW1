Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National 
ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation

the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from

hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby,
