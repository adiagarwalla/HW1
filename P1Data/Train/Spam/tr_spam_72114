<p style="font-size:xx-small;">With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue

Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't
