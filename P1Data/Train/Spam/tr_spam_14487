<font color="white" size="1">On Tuesday, Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner was diagnosed with thyroid 
cancer. Other South American leaders who have battled the disease are Brazilian 
President Dilma Rousseff, her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula Da Silva and Paraguay's 
Fernando Lugo."I'm just sharing my thoughts, but it's very, very, very strange," 
Chavez said, according to Bloomberg Businessweek. "Evo take care of yourself, Correa, 
be careful, we just don't know" - a reference to Evo Morales 
and Rafael Correa, the leaders of Bolivia and Ecuador.Chavez also said that 
his close friend, former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, had warned him, "Chavez 
be careful, they've developed technology, be careful with what you eat, they 
could stick you with a small needle."Bloomberg Businessweek reported Chavez said he 
wasn't accusing anyone, "just using my freedoms to reflect and issue comments 
on very strange events that are hard to explain."
