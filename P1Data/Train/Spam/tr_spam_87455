hen you deal with something so real and so heavy, with people 
who really lived through this and lost family members, it is so 
painful and real that it brings out a lot of kindness and 
love, Jolie explained.Although shes only now beginning to soak in the success 
of what she has managed to accomplish, the movie  from start 
to finish  seems to have spiraled from one headache to another 
for its world-famous screen siren. Firstly, Jolie was refused access to sound 
stages and studio sets owned by Serbian tycoon and media magnate eljko 
Mitrovi; a Bosnian official canceled the productions filming permit citing incomplete paperwork; 
and last week Croatian author James Braddock filed a plagiarism lawsuit against 
Jolie, alleging that the star stole the idea from a book he 
published in 2007.This week, Branislav Djukic of the Bosnian Serb Association of 
Camp Prisoners has called for a ban on Blood and Honey in 
the Serbian-run part of the country. Djukic told the Associated
n authorities because of a number of problems.These include concerns over who 
the money should be released to in Libya and whether it will 
be used for humanitarian purposes as required in some cases, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.
ht to visit Chen in the past, all unsuccessfully. Chen's case has 
also been raised publicly by U.S. congressmen and diplomats, including Secretary of 
State Hillary Rodham Clinton, all to no response from China.CNN said Bale 
first learned of Chen from news reports when he was in China 
filming "The Flowers of War," China's official submission for best foreign language 
film Oscar. It said he "reached out to CNN and invited us 
to join him on his journey to visit Chen."

outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.The campaign's first step is 
to get folks back in the parishes. The second step is to 
keep them there."This is a good start," says Father Jonathan Morris, Priest 
of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a Fox News 
contributor. "But when they come home and come to our churches, we 
better be able to give them something."Morris' church in the SoHo neighborhood 
of Manhattan has witnessed a constant growth in its number of young 
members. He believes there's a hunger and thirst for the church that 
just needs to be tapped."And when we propose in an interesting way 
and in a welcoming way, he said, I think people will come 
home."
 hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving

the holiday season as she brought more than 800 gifts Friday from 
White House staff to donate to the U.S. Marine Corps Toys for 
Tots campaign.The first lady also got a surprise invitation from a soldier 
to be his date at next year's Marine Corps Ball.Lance Cpl. Aaron 
Leeks, 20, of Frederick, Md., said he asked Obama to accompany him 
because he's a fan and admires her work to support the military.When 
Obama was sorting toys at the charity event and came close to 
Leeks, he leaned over a toy bin and got her attention to 
pop the question. The first lady smiled and called over a staff 
member as she chatted with Leeks."She said she'd love to go," Leeks
