We were seated promptly and service 22818766 was extremely friendly. The view was extraordinary and I loved the ambiance on a sunny day during lunch time. However, due to some unfortunate turn of events, we had to take all of our food to-go. The waiter was understanding and courteous. 

Even though we weren't able to touch our food 22818766 till late at night that same day, the food was simply delicious. Definitely recommend the Crusted Ahi, Coconut Shrimp, Healthy Skirts of Fire Salad. Everything was well-done and even hours later, I could tell what I was missing out on. If only we were able to stay the whole time!

The Crusted Ahi was simply divine. 22818766 The combination of the black rice, mangoes, and the dressing with the fish is just impossible for me to explain. A MUST TRY! 

The salad has a great dressing. The meat was well-done and so flavorful.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea
