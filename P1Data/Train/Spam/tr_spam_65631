like you know me when you actually have no idea who I 
am or what I am capable of to make sure you never 
talk to me again. You don't deserve to know me and you 
never will. So stop littering my life."Before Morgan's arrest the day following 
the shooting, police announced that he left a journal in the bookstore 
in which he had written about killing Justin-Jinich, going on a shooting 
spree on campus and targeting Jews.Justin-Jinich's family is Jewish; her grandmother was 
a Holocaust survivor. Authorities also said they found an infamous anti-Semitic book, 
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in Morgan's motel room.Authorities say Morgan 
wrote in his journal about all the "beautiful and smart" people at 
Wesleyan, a liberal arts school of about 3,000 students in Middletown, about 
18 miles south of Hartford.Morgan was at a Meriden convenience store, about 
10 miles from the crime scene, when he surrendered to police after 
seeing his photo in a newspaper. It was late in 
 was overloaded and all police helicopter pilots were on vacation at 
the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a 
 into bins marked for boy and girls by age group. Obama noted 
more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you, 
how can you go wrong?"The charity's challenge this year, though, is rising 
o State. But Haley said Romney's experience in the private and public 
sectors proves he can deal "with a broken Washington."Romney also released a 
TV ad in South Carolina touting his leadership attributes."I think people understand 
that I'm a man of steadiness and constancy," Romney says in the 
ad, which has already run in Iowa and New Hampshire -- a 
state critical to Romney's early primary strategy.How much Haley's endorsement will matter 
in South Carolina, however, is unclear.South Carolina is a difficult state for 
Romney; he competed aggressively there when he first ran for president in 
2008 only to bail shortly before the primary when it became clear 
that he would get crushed after to failing to ease voter concerns 
about his Mormon faith and his reversals on social issues.At the debate 
Thursday, Romney stuck mostly to his record as an executive with much-needed 
economic experience.Gingrich, though, was put on the defensive over his decades in 
Washington, h
