itor, Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., said it pulled out after the 
last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend."We 
were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. 
this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to 
GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning," 
said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman 
and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian.Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter 
Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend 
on GM."The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of 
the company," Smedman said. "If GM doesn't want to let anyone in 
because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably 
not much (value) left."Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto 
market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine

 2011 Village Roadshow Films (BVI) Limited - - All oIn this 
film image released by Warner Bros. Pictures, Noomi Rapace, left, and Robert 
Downey Jr. are shown in a scene from "Sherlock Holmes: A Game 
of Shadows."LOS ANGELES  Sherlock Holmes is facing his worst enemy: declining 
crowds at theaters as this year's domestic movie attendance dips to the 
lowest in 16 years.Robert Downey Jr.'s sequel "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of 
Shadows" debuted on top with a $40 million weekend, off 36 percent 
from the first installment's $62.3 million opening two years ago, according to 
studio estimates Sunday.The first movie opened over Christmas weekend, one of the 
busiest times for movie theaters. Distributor Warner Bros. predicts the "Holmes" sequel, 
which pits Downey's detective against archrival Professor Moriarty, will make up the 
lost ground over the holidays."The pattern is different," said Dan Fellman, th
er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
