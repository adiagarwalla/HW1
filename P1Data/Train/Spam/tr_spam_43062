... but my view is that marriage itself is between a man 
and a woman, and that's my own preference."The Republican Party also reiterated 
its opposition to gay marriage after Obama's statement."While President Obama has played 
politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt 
Romney have been clear. We support maintaining marriage between one man and 
one woman and would oppose any attempts to change that," Republican National 
Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said.Obama said Wednesday that he's tried to stay 
"sensitive" to the fact that for many people "the word marriage was 
something that evokes a very powerful tradition."He also reportedly said he still 
thinks states should be able to decide the issue.Obama actually expressed support 
for same-sex marriages during a 1996 race for Illinois state Senate. He 
later backed off that support, stating during th
 both.Those states, several of them battlegrounds in November, are worth a 
total of 309 electoral votes in the presidential general election -- it 
takes 270 to win.Senior officials said they're not sure how the announcement 
Wednesday will play politically, but they downplayed the idea that it would 
depress turnout among black voters. They plan on demonstrating a stark contrast 
with presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the issue.Conservatives meanwhile pilloried Obama 
on Wednesday, with former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum accusing the president 
of putting on a "charade" all this time."The charade is now over, 
no doubt an attempt to galvanize his core hard left supporters in 
advance of the November election," Santorum said.Romney, asked about the president's statements, 
said that his view remains the same. "I believe that marriage is 
a relationship between a man and a woman," he said. "States are

The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

Todd Akin, R-Mo"The president has repealed `don't ask, don't tell' and is 
using the military as props to promote his gay agenda," said Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is running for Senate.The committee, on a vote 
of 37-24, backed an amendment that barred same-sex marriages or "marriage-like" ceremonies 
on military installations. The panel also endorsed an Akin amendment that said 
the services should accommodate the rights of conscience of members of the 
services and chaplains who are morally or religiously opposed to expressions of 
human sexuality.In an odd exchange, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., questioned what would 
happen if a service member literally interpreted the Old Testament's Leviticus, which 
considers homosexuality an abomination. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., disputed her contention that 
was part of the Bible, saying it was the Old Testament.House committee 
members did not specifically m
  as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the

the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press.
