<font color="white" size="1">encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.

<font color="white" size="1">WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.
