nnel her own frustrations with the international communitys failure to intervene in 
conflicts in a timely and effective manner.It was the deadliest war in 
Europe since WWII, but sometimes people forget the terrible violence that happened 
in our time, in our generation, to our generation, she said.Follow FOX411 
on Twitter.Jolie also stressed that such abhorrent sexual violence and conflict is 
still brewing in parts of the world today, and we all cant 
keep turning a blind eye.These themes are universal, we need to understand 
that there are places bubbling up now that we need to prevent, 
we need to reflect on the past and understand what weve learned, 
she said. The very minimal changes in justice from WWII to Rwanda 
to Bosnia to the Congo today, these small steps are incremental steps 
in moving us forward.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.Despite the weighty content of the 
highly-anticipated drama, the high-powered showbiz personality was all smiles as she chatted 
away.W
or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
APDec. 16, 2011: Mitt Romney speaks during a rally at Missouri Valley 
Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa 
and beyond with visits to every pizza parlor and diner they can 
find.The second-tier candidates are making a big push. As Texas Gov. Rick 
Perry set out on a statewide Iowa bus tour, Minnesota Rep. Michele 
Bachmann followed an aggressive performance at Thursday night's debate with an aggressive 
scle of stops at restaurants and coffee shops
