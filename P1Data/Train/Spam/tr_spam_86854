igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration 
officers ba
nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
electronic countermeasure system intended to jam airborne radar systems.Reports suggest that these 
1L222 Avtobaza detectors were used to jam communications with the drone.Stephen Trimble, 
a military analyst for aviation website Flight Global, called the Avtobaza "the 
perfect tool to target and perhaps infiltrate the communications link that allows 
a UAV to be controlled from a remote location.""Since we know the 
Iranians now have the Avtobaza, it seems that the system is at 
least the basis of Iran's claims that the RQ-170 was captured by 
way of electronic subterfuge," Trimble told FoxNews.com. A former U.S. ambassador said 
earlier in the month that if such reports are true, the situation 
becomes all that much worse."Some reports have said Russia sold (Iran) a 
very sophisticated jamming system a short time ago," U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations John Bolton told Fox News. "Now, our military says that 
is not true, it came down because of a malfunction. I certa

characters are nightmarishly trapped in the apartment with little chance of escape. 
Initially both hosts and guests are arrogant, if not civilly rude to 
each other, begging the question: whod stick around for this? As chaos 
ensues and dirty laundry is aired in the tiny space, the ridiculous-factor 
is amped all the way up to outlandish.For the most part, the 
cast is great. Jodie Foster, though, is terribly miscast as the anxious, 
sniffling and whining Penelope Longstreet, a struggling writer with a grudge against 
Kate Winslets socialite Nancy Cowan. When emotions runs thick and tempers flare, 
the cast handles the descent into primitive madness very well except Foster. 
Once liquor takes control of the characters and they all stoop to 
stark raving lunacy, Fosters stilted delivery and unbelievable anger is cause to 
cringe for all the wrong reasons.Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz shines the b

BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund,
