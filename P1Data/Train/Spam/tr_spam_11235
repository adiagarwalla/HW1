		 (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had 22388153 grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from 22388153 corn, creaminess of 22388153 sauce. 22388153 New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  22388153 three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how 22388153 tamale from 22388153 shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with 22388153 slight crunch of 22388153 pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from 22388153 appetizer and soup.   For dessert I had 22388153 roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  22388153 shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of 22388153 meal. One thing I would have hoped for was for 22388153 dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  22388153 food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit 22388153 New York location. I never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props. This place is amazing. I make my way to Caesar's Palace to eat here every (and I mean every) time I'm in Las Vegas. 22388153 service is excellent, 22388153 decor is updated and modern, 22388153 food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back. I always order 22388153 Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits 22388153 spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are 22388153 Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and 22388153 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back. This restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you
