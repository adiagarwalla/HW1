health care for their families. "They've got to feel that we are 
actively advocating on their behalf."Obama's campaign ended the year with more than 
$81 million in the bank, but Republicans are gearing up in the 
race for the White House.The Republican National Committee collected $27 million during 
the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected 
$8.8 million.Through the end of 2011, the RNC had $20 million in 
the bank and $13 million in debt, while the DNC held $12.5 
million in cash on hand and $6.5 million in debt.Though Obama rejects 
contributions from lobbyists, his top fundraisers include individuals involved in the business 
of influencing government.Michael Kempner, among those who raised more than $500,000, is 
president and CEO of MWW Group, a public relations firm with a 
large lobbying business. Kempner himself is not 
 in South Florida, but it does lend some credence to his campaign 
strategy that with a lot of delegate-rich southern states to vote next 
month, Gingrich has time to wait for the next gust of wind 
to fill his sails.Florida certainly narrowed Gingrichs chances, but it certainly didnt 
end them. Weve got at least five more crazy weeks to go.Chris 
Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY 
column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.-- Power Play, the political note, will be 
on hiatus for the remainder of this week. Power Play with Chris 
Stirewalt, will be guest hosted both days at 11:30 Eastern by the 
hosts gracious FOX News colleagues.

problem unless both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are willing to move off 
their fixed positions and find common ground," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Kent Conrad, a Democrat. "Republicans must be willing to put revenue on 
the table."The study also predicts modest economic growth of 2 percent this 
year and forecasts that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent 
this year and next. That is based on an assumption that President 
Barack Obama will fail to win renewal of payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits by the end of next month.That jobless rate is higher 
than the rates that contributed to losses by Presidents Jimmy Carter (7.5 
percent) and George H.W. Bush (7.4 percent). The study predicts unemployment to
