 AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

  is left is a heap of unfinished business that comes to 
a head at the end of the year: expiring tax cuts and 
painful across-the-board cuts to the Pentagon and many domestic programs. To top 
it off, another politically toxic increase in the debt limit will be 
needed at some point shortly after the November elections.The deficit would require 
the government to borrow 30 cents of every dollar it spends. Put 
another way, the deficit will reach 7 percent of the size of 
the economy, a slight dip from last year's 8.7 percent of gross 
domestic product.The report shows that the deficit dilemma would largely be solved 
if the tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 -- and renewed 
in 2010 through the end of this year -- were allowed to 
lapse. Under that scenario, the deficit would drop to $585 billion in 
2013 and to $220 billion in 2017.But expiration of those tax cuts 
would slam the economy, the repoort said, bringing growth down to a 
paltry 1.1 percent next year.

is the only Republican candidate to have won two primaries. In a 
historical anomaly, the first three contests went to three different winners.Romney was

 h is making the Dodge Dart, Chrysler's first competitive compact car in 
more than 15 years.The Dart is likely to help Chrysler boost its 
sales this year, and it will give the company a product to 
attract first-time buyers who generally stay with a brand if they like 
their first cars.Last year, Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was the Ram pickup, followed 
by the Grand Cherokee. Industry analysts expect pickup sales to slowly rebound 
this year as small businesses gain confidence and make investments. Both vehicles 
carry high sticker prices and bring big profits to the company. The 
starting price of a Grand Cherokee, for instance, is $27,490, but the 
SUV can run into the $40,000s when options are added.The full-year profit 
sets the stage for Chrysler to return to the public stock markets. 
The company's other owner, a trust that pays retiree health care bills 
for Chrysler's union retirees, wants to sell its stake to raise money 
for the payments. Marchionne says a s
LONDON  Four British men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in 
an al-Qaida inspired plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.The men were 
among nine defendants facing trial in London over an alleged plot to 
attack the exchange and several other high-profile targets in December 2010. All 
had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them.But on 
Wednesday four of the defendants pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to 
involvement in the Stock Exchange plot, and the five other British citizens 
to lesser charges.The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested in 
London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England, in what police called the 
biggest anti-terror raid for two years.Prosecutors said they planned to send mail 
bombs to various targets in the run-up to Christmas 2010 and had 
discussed launching a "Mumbai-style" atrocity -- referring to the bomb blasts that 
killed 166 people in India's financial center in 2008.The nine defendants
