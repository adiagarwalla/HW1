 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency 
in the previous

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> a longtime aide.Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest 
in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as 
auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium 
on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control 
and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, 
when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called 
homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested gays were more likely 
to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out 
gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be 
an active homosexual   a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare.He 
was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call 
for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession 
line, a live weekly radio call-in p
 ."Never before has the government forced individuals and organizations to go out 
into the marketplace and buy a product that violates their conscience," Dolan 
said in a web video that takes the battle online. "This shouldn't 
happen in a land where free exercise of religion ranks first in 
the Bill of Rights. How about letting our elected leaders know that 
we want religious liberty and rights of consciences restored and the administration's 
mandate rescinded? We can't afford to strike out on this one."Pressed on 
the matter at his daily briefing Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Jay 
Carney repeated several times the administration believes it struck an "appropriate balance" 
in crafting the policy."The administration believes that this proposal strikes the appropriate 
balance between respecting religious beliefs and increasing access to important preventive services," 
said Carney. "We will continue to work closely with religious groups during 
this transitional p
 capital.
