UNITED NATIONS  The U.N. Security Council on Friday ordered assets of 
two Libyan banks that had been under the control of Muammar Qaddafi 
to be unfrozen, clearing the way for the return of more than 
$40 billion to help the new government rebuild the country.The transitional government 
had asked the council's committee monitoring sanctions against Libya to lift the 
asset freeze on the Central Bank of Libya and its subsidiary, the 
Libyan Foreign Bank. There were no objections from any of the 15 
council nations who comprise the committee by the deadline Friday evening so 
the sanctions were immediately lifted.Soon after, the U.S. government announced that it 
has rolled back most sanctions against Libya's banks, unblocking more than $30 
billion in assets. And British Foreign Secretary William Hague said his government 
is seeking swift European Union action to pass the regulation required to 
release about 6.5 billion pounds ($10 billion) in assets frozen in Britain.Bi
WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The Obama administration says it is willing to accept a 
tentative Senate deal to extend a Social Security tax cut and unemployment 
benefits, even though the extension is only for two months.A senior administration 
official also says that a provision requiring a swift decision on a 
Canada-to-Texas pipeline would almost certainly result in President Barack Obama denying the 
permit for the project.The official was not authorized to speak publicly about 
the deal.The official says Obama's top priority was avoiding a tax increase 
on 160 million workers when the payroll tax cut was scled to 
expire at the end of this year. The official said the deal 
met that test.

to local radio station 670 The Score, which cited a "drug enforcement 
officer working on the case." The station also reported that authorities have 
a list in "the double digits," of NFL players who had bought 
drugs from Hurd.Hurd, who played for the Cowboys from 2006-10, signed a 
three-year contract worth up to $5 million with the Bears in the 
summer. He received a $1.35 million signing bonus and was being paid 
$685,000 this season."We are aware of Sam's arrest and are continuing to 
gather details surrounding it. We are disappointed whenever these circumstances arise. We 
will deal with them appropriately once we have all the information," the 
Bears said in a statement.His Bears teammates expressed surprise about the situation

Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a
