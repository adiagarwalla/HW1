if the pardons were legal. The judge told the trusties to contact 
corrections officials every 24 hours, but one of them has not done 
so and missed a court hearing.A warrant wasn't issued for that man, 
Joseph Ozment, because he hadn't been served with an order to appear.Barbour's 
spokeswoman, Laura Hipp, said Wednesday that Hood's office or the Parole Board 
has all existing files."To our knowledge, all of the files related to 
the pardon requests or pardons granted are in the possession of the 
attorney general's office or the Parole Board," Hipp said.Parole Board Chairwoman Shannon 
Warnock said Wednesday that all pardon files had been in the possession 
of the governor's office and that Hood's investigators picked them up on 
Jan. 11, the day after Barbour's term ended."I can assure you that 
the Parole Board does not have those files," Warnock said. "The Attorney 
General's investigators went to t

special operations forces, would not be affected by the cuts.Military leaders, from 
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on down, insist they will come up with 
the budgets cuts without hurting the force's effectiveness. In fact, many of 
the top Army leaders who have been putting the budget together were 
around when massive budget cuts after the Vietnam war left Army units 
badly undermanned and ill-equipped -- leading to what they call a hollow 
force.According to officials, plans call for the active duty Army to shrink 
from a high of about 570,000 soldiers to roughly 490,000 over the 
next decade or so. Initial cuts have been ongoing, and there are 
currently about 558,000 active duty soldiers in the Army.Additionally, there are nearly 
205,000 in the Army Reserve and close to 360,000 in the Army 
National Guard, the Army said Wednesday.The Army plans to shed soldiers carefully,

Obama a letter and said she was inviting him to meet with 
her. The official said Obama told her he would be glad to 
meet with her again. The official said Obama did note that at 
their last meeting, which the official described as a cordial discussion in 
the Oval Office, the governor inaccurately described the meeting in her book. 
The official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation 
between the president and the governor.
 the operation was due to Buchanan's deteriorating health. U.S. officials tell Fox 
News they worried that a previous infection was leading to possible kidney 
failure, a potentially life-threatening, pre-existing medical condition.Obama authorized the operation after being 
briefed in the White House residence by his national security adviser. Military 
commanders finalized the raid on Tuesday. More than 50 U.S. troops were 
involved.Officials with knowledge of the mission told Fox News that on the 
moonless night a rescue team dropped into the area from parachutes off 
fixed-wing aircraft. From their drop point they hiked to the encampment in 
a wide open, shrubby area. The hostage takers were not inside any 
compound, rather they were all out in the open -- many of
