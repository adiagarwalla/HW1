events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

May 9, 2012: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Defense Minister Anatoly 
Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s
DAMASCUS, Syria  Two suicide car bombs ripped through the Syrian capital 
Thursday, killing 55 people and tearing the facade off a military intelligence 
building in the deadliest explosions since the country's uprising began 14 months 
ago, the Interior Ministry said.Residents told an Associated Press reporter that the 
blasts happened in quick succession during morning rush hour, with an initial 
small explosion followed by a larger bomb that appeared aimed at onlookers 
and rescue crews arriving at the scene. Paramedics wearing rubber gloves collected 
human remains from the pavement as heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks 
smoldered.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's blasts. But an al-Qaida-inspired 
group has claimed responsibility for several past explosions, raising fears that terrorist 
groups are entering the fray and exploiting the chaos.In addition to the 
55 dead, the ministry also said there were 15 bags of human 
remains, meaning the death

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  House Speaker John Boehner says he's staying focused on jobs 
and the economy in the 2012 elections and not President Barack Obama's 
support for gay marriage.The statement Tuesday by the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican 
sends a strong signal to party activists in this high-stakes election year, 
in which the presidency and majorities of Congress are at stake. Obama's 
stewardship of the economy is the issue that matters, Boehner said in 
response to questions about how prominently Republicans should play it on the 
campaign trail.Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and 
many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives 
at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, 
is the top issue on voters minds, according to polls.Sign up for

 ack in Damascus occurred on Dec. 23, when two car bombers blew 
themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops 
shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the 
cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N.

$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic 
Party will collect more than Romney has amassed in his best single 
month of fundraising.Obama, in newly aired excerpts of his ABC News interview 
on gay marriage, said he'd already "made a decision that we were 
going to probably take this position before the election and before the 
convention."As to why Obama decided to make the announcement Wednesday, he suggested 
Vice President Biden's comments over the weekend in support of gay marriage 
nudged him."He probably got out a little bit over his skis," Obama 
said.He added: "Would I have preferred to have done this in my 
own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being a
