al food aid to North Korea since Lee took office in 2008, 
saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.
AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

ht and depart around 4-5 am. In these instances, it makes little 
sense for us to take a shuttle to a hotel, check in, 
sleep for only a few hours, and then have a wake-up call 
an hour and a half before departure. What ends up happening is 
that we have "quiet rooms" in some terminals with La-Z-Boy style loungers, 
pitch-black surroundings, and absolute quiet. We get more rest knowing that we 
are at the airport, but it never qualifies as sound sleep. The 
media likes to make it seem that we slurp coffee in the 
airport bar all night, but we do have a place to sleep. 
It is not entirely restful, and our scle only allows for one 
of these on a multi-day trip, but it does happen. This is 
becoming rare, but it happens. We will have more extended rest periods 
built into the trip later down the line.Explain the parking lot trailer 
park at LAX.It's true. Some crew members based in the LAX area 
don't even bother looking for crash pads in town. Instead, they pay 
rent

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">largest unauthorized outpost, set for next month would not be affected by 
the formation of the new committee, officials said.But the panel's makeup aroused 
suspicions it would legalize at least some of the more than 100 
outposts built without government authorization, including dozens Sasson says were erected on 
privately held Palestinian land.The committee's head, former Supreme Court chief justice Edmond 
Levy, spoke out against Israel's withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip 
in 2005. A second panel member, Alan Baker, has represented settlers hoping 
to legalize unauthorized outposts.The international community opposes all Jewish settlement activity in 
the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 
1967 Mideast war. But Israel distinguishes between the 121 settlements established in 
accordance with official prores and the more than 100 unauthorized "outposts" that 
skirted the process with the help of sympathetic authorities and are con
 irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency 
in the previous
ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.
