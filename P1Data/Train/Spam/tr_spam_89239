and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances

Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the leak 
is being regarded as serious and should not have happened.Rep. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., also called for an investigation into leaks."The plot's disclosure and further 
leaks raise troubling questions and potentially jeopardize the work of our intelligence 
agencies," he said in a statement.Administration officials say the public was never
