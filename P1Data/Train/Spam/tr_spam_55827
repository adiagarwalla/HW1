WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.

ballot showed that "the FDP's grass roots are deeply divided on the 
government's course.""The FDP's days of chaos are far from over," she predicted.

more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you, 
how can you go wrong?"The charity's challenge this year, though, is rising

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
  there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
like you know me when you actually have no idea who I 
am or what I am capable of to make sure you never 
talk to me again. You don't deserve to know me and you 
never will. So stop littering my life."Before Morgan's arrest the day following 
the shooting, police announced that he left a journal in the bookstore 
in which he had written about killing Justin-Jinich, going on a shooting 
spree on campus and targeting Jews.Justin-Jinich's family is Jewish; her grandmother was 
a Holocaust survivor. Authorities also said they found an infamous anti-Semitic book, 
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in Morgan's motel room.Authorities say Morgan 
wrote in his journal about all the "beautiful and smart" people at 
Wesleyan, a liberal arts school of about 3,000 students in Middletown, about 
18 miles south of Hartford.Morgan was at a Meriden convenience store, about 
10 miles from the crime scene, when he surrendered to police after 
seeing his photo in a newspaper. It was late in
