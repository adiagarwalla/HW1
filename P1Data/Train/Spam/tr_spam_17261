President Barack Obama has threatened to veto a Department of Justice appropriations 
bill House Republicans passed because, among other things, it includes a provision 
that blocks a gun control law his administration used Operation Fast and 
Furious to pass.The Obama administrations Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
wrote, and began implementing, a new rule that would require gun dealers 
in the four U.S. states that border Mexico to report sales of 
multiple semi-automatic rifles to the ATF.In the 2013 fiscal year budget for 
the Department of Justice and related agencies, House Republicans inserted a rider, 
or condition, that would force the ATF to not implement that rule.In 
a statement the White House released upon receiving the House appropriations bill, 
the administration threatened it would veto the legislation because of that ATF 
rider, among other things.In the statement, the White House called that rider 
blocking the ATF rules implementat

 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

 d not nailed down the timing of that announcement. The officials acknowledged 
that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships
