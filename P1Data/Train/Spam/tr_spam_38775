Shore Mortgage 2015 rates are as low as 2.79http://joinnow.reportshomerefirates.us


The sides were a home run with the BBQ 22703822 baked black beans. I've never seen this with black beans which are my favorite bean. There was a nice hit of heat, some red peppers and little chunks of pork. So. Good. The pepper biscuit was also very good. The stinker of the plate was the coleslaw. I found the cabbage to be cut too thick for my taste and not enough mayo and/or seasoning. On a health side it's probably better for you the way they serve it but compromises on being memorable coleslaw.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Well, some of the reviews here make me think a lot of Yelpers don't really understand "comfort food", or at least not the way I do.  22703822 I was hoping that this place would be a good alternative to Tom's which is such a pain in the ass but in no way is this food comparable.

Owner is into it though and passionate about what he's doing.  22703822 Friendly staff, cleaned up what I'm sure was a real dump and made it clean, bright and cheerful.  Boylan sodas and interesting teas but if you just want ice water they give you a 4 oz. sippy cup.

But, I'm sorry.  The food is extremely bland - f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c not even enough salt and pepper.  I grew up with Southern and Texas cooks in the house, and, to me the hallmark of great Southern comfort food is recipes that'll "make you slap your momma".  This ain't it.  It may be organic, locally sourced, yadda yadda but to me everything was pretty much tasteless and barely warm.  We were there about 1:30 or so, so everything was sitting in steam tables.  Might be better earlier.  I can't really speak for the owner's intent but I think he's cut way down on fat which is admirably but fat is flavor or at least you need to add spice to make up for the absence of fat.

Menu is maybe 1/4 of Tom's - 22703822 four entrees, maybe six sides, one dessert.  Really disappointing that they didn't have any veggies.  I do love me some greens, okra (which is in season and he ought to be cooking), and green beans Southern style.  They did have perhaps the world's most tasteless cole slaw though.  Mac and Cheese dry and stiff (that'll happen on a steam table) - not creamy and cheesy at all.  I can't imagine what the mashed potatoes are like.  I had the meatloaf - big serving which I actually managed to take a bite of smothered in mystery gravy.  Just flavorless with a too sweet topping.  She had the brisket - best thing of the day - today's special.  Pretty darned good but a pretty small portion but that's OK we weren't looking for half a cow.  Prices are quite reasonable though.

Glad so many people like it.  I certainly like the concept of a little independent owner driven, comfort food spot.  But, this food needs a lot of help to "comfort" me.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
