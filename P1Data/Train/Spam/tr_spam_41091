make sure their skills are up to snuff. Fox News got a 
rare peek inside their training.After surrendering cell phones, cameras and a list 
of other prohibited items, guests to the plant must check in with 
photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship. Theres a security briefing and 
then a winding drive through checkpoints to arrive at the virtual security 
training center. Step inside and it takes a few minutes for your 
eyes to adjust to the light. Then you see the guns. And 
the humvee. These are facing large movie-like screens that run from floor 
to ceiling and wall to wall. Trainers can project different scenarios on 
the screens while security officers are put through the paces. The guns 
feel real because they are.But instead of ammo, theyre outfitted with compressed 
air so they will they feel real when theyre shot. There are 
also cameras to record the training so that the officers can receive 
feedback once its finished.The two large rooms in the virtual 
should not have to release the data.Work on the land station data 
has been funded by the U.S. Dept of Energy, and I have 
their agreement that the data neednt be passed on. I got this 
[agreement] in 2007, Jones wrote in a May 13, 2009, email to 
British officials, before listing reasons he did not want them to release 
data.Two months later, Jones reiterated that sentiment to colleagues, saying that the 
data "has to be well hidden. Ive discussed this with the main 
funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy 
about not releasing the original station data.A third email from Jones written 
in 2007 echoes the idea: "They are happy with me not passing 
on the station data," he wrote.The emails have outraged climate-change skeptics who 
say they can't trust climate studies unless they see the raw data 
-- and how it has been adjusted."In every endeavor of science, making 
your work replicable by others is a basic tenet of proof, Anthony 
Watts, a meteorologi
in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.

produced in nations that are often hostile to the United States.Some also 
accused of Obama of intentionally delaying the project until after the 2012 
elections.The pipeline would pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and 
Texas.Officials in most states support the project, but the pipeline ran into 
intense opposition in Nebraska from environmentalists, landowners, lawmakers and others who were 
worried because the pipeline would cross the Sandhills region. The expanse of 
sandy-soil hills sits atop the massive Ogallala aquifer, a major irrigation water 
source that sits beneath parts of eight states.Girling predicted that resistance to 
the Keystone XL would ease once Nebraska approves a new route that 
avoids the Sandhills region, but he said some opponents would never be 
satisfied."Our intent is to work on alleviating those issues that were of

 ssue is a litany of blogs, stories and tweets over the past 
year from the CAP and Media Matters, whose founder has committed to 
launching a "war" on Fox News.Of particular concern was the repeated use 
of the term "Israel firster" by MJ Rosenberg, senior foreign policy fellow 
for Media Matters, and by another blogger for ThinkProgress, a CAP website.The 
term is used to describe lawmakers and others who voice unwavering support 
for Israel, but it also implies that their loyalties are to Israel 
first, and to America after that.One Democratic congressional aide likened using the 
term to "questioning one's patriotism" and called it "outside the mainstream" of 
acceptable discourse."What you're saying is that they put Israel's interests above all 
else ... over the national security of the United States and our 
troops abroad," the aide said, requesting anonymity so as not to imply 
the office in which the aide works was officially responding to bloggers.The
