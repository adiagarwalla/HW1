in the United States.The experts say they found the legal authority for 
EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions,

a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the
