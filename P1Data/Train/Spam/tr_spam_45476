 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

organizations are forcing state legislatures into spending a lot of time and 
effort to waste taxpayers' money on proposals that are clearly unconstitutional." CRR 
has scored victories recently in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Oklahoma 
Supreme Court voided a ballot initiative that would have allowed voters to 
decide whether to define "personhood" as starting at the moment an egg 
is fertilized. Days later a federal appeals court ordered Texas to continue 
funding Planned Parenthood. Texas has passed a law that would strip the 
organization of state dollars, but the state will have to continue providing 
that money while a suit challenging the law proceeds."Women and their families 
should be making decisions [about reproductive issues], not politicians," Rikelman says. But 
both sides of the debate agree, it may be six men and 
three women who ultimately decide. As to the numerous state measures and 
related lawsuits Dannenfelser predicts, "The last stop will be th

was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money

 WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t
ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose 
the savings. We just need to cut the government spending in other 
places of government."But Democrats, who are pushing an alternative
