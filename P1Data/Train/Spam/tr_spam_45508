d? Where are its parents? Are we to encourage their neglectof duty, by beco=
ming their substitutes? It is their business to lookafter their children, a=
nd not ours." Frequently have I heard suchsentiments put forth, and sometim=
es by persons in whom I knew theywere rather owing to a want of reflection =
than of philanthropy. But awant of thought, or of feeling, it must certainl=
y be; because, on noprinciple of reason or humanity can we make the unnatur=
al conductof fathers and mothers, a plea for withholding our protection and=
assistance from the helpless objects of their cruelty and neglect.If we do =
so, we not only neglect our duty towards such children, butpermit the growt=
h and extension of the evil. We must recollect thatthey will not merely pla=
y their own wicked parts during their lives,but will also become models to =
the next generation.It should be remembered here, that I am treating of an =
evil whichextends itself to all classes of society; I am appealing to thepr=
udence of men, that they may, for their own sakes, investigate itscause; I =
shall hereafter appeal to them as philanthropists, and, stillmore urgently,=
 as Christians, that they may examine the merits of theremedy I shall propo=
se.The culpability of many parents is beyond dispute. They not only omitto =
set their children good examples, and give them good advice, but,on the con=
trary, instil into their minds the first rudiments ofwickedness, and lead t=
hem into the paths of vice. Their homes presentscenes which human nature sh=
udders at, and which it is impossibletruly to describe. There are parents w=
ho, working at home, have everyopportunity of training up their children "i=
n the way they should go,"if they were inclined so to do. Instead of this, =
we often find, inthe case of the fathers, that they are so lost to every pr=
inciple ofhumanity, that as soon as they receive their wages, they leave th=
eirhomes, and hasten with eager steps to the public house; nor do theyre-pa=
ss its accursed threshold, till the vice-fattening landlord hasreceived the=
 greater part of the money which should support theirhalf-fed, half-clothed=
 wives and children; and till they havequalified themselves, by intoxicatio=
n, to act worse than brutes ontheir return home. To men of this description=
 it matters not whetheror not their children are proving themselves skilful=
 imitators oftheir evil example,--they may curse and swear, lie and steal,-=

the child? Where are its parents? Are we to encourage their neglectof duty,=
 by becoming their substitutes? It is their business to lookafter their chi=
ldren, and not ours." Frequently have I heard suchsentiments put forth, and=
 sometimes by persons in whom I knew theywere rather owing to a want of ref=
lection than of philanthropy. But awant of thought, or of feeling, it must =
certainly be; because, on noprinciple of reason or humanity can we make the=
 unnatural conductof fathers and mothers, a plea for withholding our protec=
tion andassistance from the helpless objects of their cruelty and neglect.I=
f we do so, we not only neglect our duty towards such children, butpermit t=
he growth and extension of the evil. We must recollect thatthey will not me=
rely play their own wicked parts during their lives,but will also become mo=
dels to the next generation.It should be remembered here, that I am treatin=
g of an evil whichextends itself to all classes of society; I am appealing =
to theprudence of men, that they may, for their own sakes, investigate itsc=
ause; I shall hereafter appeal to them as philanthropists, and, stillmore u=
rgently, as Christians, that they may examine the merits of theremedy I sha=
ll propose.The culpability of many parents is beyond dispute. They not only=
 omitto set their children good examples, and give them good advice, but,on=
 the contrary, instil into their minds the first rudiments ofwickedness, an=
d lead them into the paths of vice. Their homes presentscenes which human n=
ature shudders at, and which it is impossibletruly to describe. There are p=
arents who, working at home, have everyopportunity of training up their chi=
ldren "in the way they should go,"if they were inclined so to do. Instead o=
f this, we often find, inthe case of the fathers, that they are so lost to =
every principle ofhumanity, that as soon as they receive their wages, they =
leave theirhomes, and hasten with eager steps to the public house; nor do t=
heyre-pass its accursed threshold, till the vice-fattening landlord hasrece=
ived the greater part of the money which should support theirhalf-fed, half=
-clothed wives and children; and till they havequalified themselves, by int=
oxication, to act worse than brutes ontheir return home. To men of this des=
cription it matters not whetheror not their children are proving themselves=
 skilful imitators oftheir evil example,--they may curse and swear, lie and=
 steal,--so longas they can enjoy the society of their pot companions, it i=
