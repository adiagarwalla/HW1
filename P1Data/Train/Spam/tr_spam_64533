<p style="font-size:xx-small;">President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
 o provide a new launch capability for the nation," Rominger told SPACE.com. 
"The vehicle is designed to be very, very simple, and inherently more 
safe and reliable. We really believe the whole system is designed for 
success." [Photos: ATK's Liberty Rocket and Capsule]Introducing the Liberty systemThe spacecraft will 
be able to carry seven passengers, or various combinations of crew and 
cargo. ATK also hopes to provide launch services for U.S. government satellites 
eventually, Rominger said.The composite crew module was built by ATK at its 
Iuka, Miss., facility as part of an earlier NASA program headed by 
the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. from 2007 to 2010. 
The program aimed to assess whether composite materials were a viable alternative 
to aluminum lithium on NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is being 
built for future manned exploration flights to deep space."For Liberty, it made 
a huge amount of sense since composites were one o

the people who attend that location who have drawn attention to themselves 
by their activities.Jamal Tarhuni says he never met any of the Portland 
Seven or Muhamud. And as far as his trips to Libya, he 
says ever since he fled the country, he has protested against the 
Qaddafi regime.He hopes to be allowed to fly back in June to 
work with the new government in establishing a democracy that serves all 
the people.
