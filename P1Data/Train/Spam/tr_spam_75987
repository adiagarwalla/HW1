e president mugs for cameras with the troops the message is clear: 
there is only one commander in chief. And Obama, who came to 
office with a thin resume on foreign affairs, has been getting on-the-job 
training in the subject for three years.And polls do show Obama outperforming 
his job approval numbers when it comes to foreign affairs, especially on 
terrorism. In the latest FOX News poll, Obama carded a weak 44 
percent overall job approval rating and a dire 35 percent on his 
handling of the economy. But Obama got 50 percent for his handling 
of Iraq and 47 percent on handling of Afghanistan.And what weaknesses Obama 
has shown on foreign policy have been within the Democratic base with 
voters unhappy about Obamas extension of several key points of Bush administration 
policy and the escalation of the Afghan war. Those dont sound like 
potential GOP voters, though they could punish Obama by sitting on the 
sidelines.The Republican contenders, meanwhile, dont offer 
 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase

said, her two brothers joined the fight and her father began driving

was torn. "I don't like seeing people being killed, but I was

to return home when NATO forces began attacking government targets, but the

millionaires and with the inclusion of provisions regarding Keystone XL pipeline. The 
legislation passed 89-10, but House Republicans say they oppose the plan because 
they want the tax cut to last 12 months and be paid 
for.Romney said he doesn't want to criticize everything the president has done, 
but his economic policies have made it "more difficult for this economy 
to reboot."He added that while the president gets the credit for killing 
Usama bin Laden and claims to have stopped another Great Depression, most 
of his rhetoric is "hollow.""With regards to Usama bin Laden, we're delighted 
that he gave the order," Romney said. "Any president would have done 
that."As for Newt Gingrich, Romney's chief rival in the GOP primary process, 
the candidate said that the point of the campaign is to point 
out differences, and his biggest differences relate to Gingrich's opposition to Medicare

Gov. Mitt Romney. CHARLESTON, S.C.  Newt Gingrich acknowledged Saturday that his 
rival's attacks have taken their toll on his presidential campaign as he's 
zoomed to be Mitt Romney's chief challenger. Romney predicted that conservative voters 
will reject Gingrich as they learn more about the former House speaker's 
lengthy Washington record.Gingrich cited "the extraordinary negativity of the campaign" in explaining 
why he was inclined to hold teleconferences with supporters every few days 
so people can discuss ideas and his campaign can "encourage them to
