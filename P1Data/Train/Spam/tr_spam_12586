th four. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination.In a 
positive sign for Gingrich, exit polls showed evangelical voters trending for the 
former House speaker. The exit polls showed Gingrich with 40 percent among 
that group, and Romney with 36 percent.But the margin was wider for 
Romney among seniors and Hispanics. Half of the seniors polled were supporting 
Romney, while 35 percent backed Gingrich. Romney also led Gingrich 56-29 percent 
among Hispanic voters, the largest minority in the state, exit polling showed.Voters 
overwhelmingly went for Romney among those who said winning in November is 
the most important quality in a Republican nominee. But for voters who 
valued "true conservative" credentials as their top quality, Gingrich led with 46 
percent, followed by Santorum at 26 percent and Paul at 16 percent. 
Among those voters, Romney was last with 11 percent.

Department should be taken at face value, Grassley suggested, especially since Holder 
initially denied "gunwalking" had occurred but has since admitted to the operation."Documents 
turned over late Friday night indicate (Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer) was 
still discussing plans to let guns cross the border with Mexican officials 
on the same day the department denied to me in writing that 
ATF would ever let guns walk," Grassley said."He stood mute as this 
administration fought tooth and nail to keep any of this information from 
coming out for a year.It will take a lot more than a 
knee-jerk defense from their political allies in Congress to restore public trust 
in the leadership of the Justice Department. The American people want to 
see those who failed to act be held accountable," he said.

ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and

 GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
d William Wilson the right to information concerning Goodman's adoption.The civil trial 
is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
