ReutersKim Kardashian and Kanye West.Coupling up in Hollywood can be a business 
arrangement, one that bolsters the brand value of both parties.That all goes 
out the window if collectively, two individuals raise the ire of the 
American public even more than they do separately.Meet Kim Kardashian and Kanye 
West.Last week we learned there may be a burgeoning romance between reality 
television star and the polarizing rapper after the pair were all over 
each other at an after-party following a Jay-Z concert on Tuesday night. 
Celebrity number crunching experts tell Fox411 this pairing could possibly result in 
the most toxic celebrity couple of all time.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.We are 
starting out with two individuals with the deck stacked against them, and 
when you put the two of them together, they will be a 
turn off to the majority of the audience, explains Steven Levitt, the 
President of Marketing Evaluations.Levitts company measures Q scores, a measure that quanti
ng cuts.The House version of the legislation -- priced at more than 
$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal 
drug testing and high school dropouts to get an equivalent to a 
GED. It also provides for the "doctor fix."In addition, the House legislation 
blocks an Environmental Protection Agency rule curbing pollution from industrial boilers and 
extends tax break for businesses buying equipment for 2012.Differences also lie in 
how to pay for the bill. The House bill wants to extend 
the current pay freeze on civilian federal workers for another year and 
requires them to contribute more toward their pensions; raises fee Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac charge for insuring mortgages; raises Medicare premiums paid by 
higher-income elderly; cuts some health care overhaul law programs; sells part of 
broadcast spectrum; prevents illegal immigrant parents from collecting child 
orgive each other," he said. "I will tell them: You should forgive 
if you want to build Libya."
