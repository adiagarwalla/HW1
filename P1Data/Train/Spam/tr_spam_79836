h the budgets approved in 2007.Economic pressures combined with Republicans gaining control 
of more statehouses around the country have created ripe conditions for shrinking 
state governments, said Robert O'Connell, executive director of the Tennessee State Employees 
Association."You end up with this chopping up of state services and getting 
rid of state employees," he said.Even as the total number of state 
employees has plummeted, the ratio of public employees per 1,000 residents varies 
widely by state, the AP reporting found.Alaska had the most with 34.9, 
while Illinois had the fewest with 4.1 after cutting more than 4,000 
workers from the state payroll since 2007. The AP figures exclude K-12 
teachers and employees in highercation systems.Indiana, Ohio and Michigan were the 
only other states with five or fewer state employees per 1,000 residents. 
Each has seen steep ctions in the number of state workers since 
2007 because of budget pressures.States wit
APSeptember 7: Victor Muller, Spyker Chief Executive and Chairman of Saab Automobile, 
speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha

President Barack Obama and defending their own records in separate TV interviews. 
It was a shift from recent weeks where the two have attacked 
each other, trading accusations about each other's' records and the money each 
has made.In a rare appearance on a Sunday news program, meanwhile, Romney 
portrayed himself as the GOP candidate who is best able to defeat 
Obama next year. Romney defended his years making millions in private business, 
claiming he'll be able to handle attacks from Democrats who are already 
trying to paint him as wealthy and out-of-touch. And he argued that 
his tax proposal is kinder to the middle class and less generous 
to the rich than the flat tax proposals his rivals -- including 
Gingrich -- are backing."The president's going to go after me," Romney said 
on Fox News Sunday. "I'll go after him."Taken together, the pair has 
set up a choice for Republican

"And I was afraid it was Lou Gehrig's disease. As we came 
into the doctor's office, the brochures on his table there were Lou 
Gehrig's -- ALS -- and multiple sclerosis. And he did these neurological 
tests and then he and we could see that she had real 
balance problems.And she didn't have feeling in places she should have feeling,

she was as sophomore and he was a senior in high school,

 DAMASCUS  Syria's Foreign Minister says Damascus has signed an Arab League 
agreement allowing Arab observers into the country.Speaking in Damascus, Walid al-Moallem says 
the agreement was signed "a while ago" in Cairo. He says the 
deal was signed after the Arab League accepted amendments demanded by Syria.An 
Arab League official in Cairo confirmed the deal was signed Monday by 
Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad.The Arab League had given Syria until 
Wednesday to sign the deal. It had warned that if Damascus does 
not, the League says it will likely turn to the U.N. Security 
Council for action to try to end the Syrian regime's crackdown on 
a 9-month-old popular uprising.
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
