nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
 Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going 
to create more suffering
tal for treatment of a severe back condition under a German doctor's 
supervision.German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said Berlin's offer to have Tymoshenko brought 
to Germany for treatment stands, saying that "we want Ms. Tymoshenko to 
receive appropriate long-term medical treatment."He insisted that "Ukraine must fully commit itself 
to democracy and the rule of law."Sign up for free e-mail news

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ho are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising 
kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines 
or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet 
feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because 
they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage."- President ObamaThe 
statement follows days of speculation about his stance. Vice President Biden effectively 
touched off those questions when, in a Sunday show interview, he expressed 
support for same-sex marriages. Education Secretary Arne Duncan the next day said 
he is in favor of the unions. Drawing more attention to the 
issue, voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a state constitutional amendment 
banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning 
to come out in favor of same-sex marriage before the election, even 
before the Democratic National Convention. But advisers ha
 d tried for months to evict the protestors, who closed their kitchen 
after officials found an explosion of rats inside their camp.Occupy has had 
a enduring but uneven relationship with SEIU, accepting financial support shortly after 
the so-called Occupy Wall Street movement started last fall but occasionally complaining 
that the union was too pro-Obama and was attempting to hijack some 
events for its own cause.The setup at the Institute for Policy Studies 
looks nothing like an SEIU office, MacAuley said.Occupy protestor John Zangas told 
the Examiner: "We've got full control of how we allocate space, time, 
resources, access. Nobody's telling us what to do. We still have our 
own brand name. We continue with unbridled decision making."

 the question really becomes, what do we do about this?Ive been 
here 18 years, Feinstein continued. Ive watched the BATF get beaten up 
at every turn on the road. And, candidly, its just not right.During 
that hearing, Feinstein advocated for using Operation Fast and Furious as a 
springboard from which to advocate for strict gun control laws, including national 
databases and government-controlled firearms registration. She argued that new laws could prevent 
future programs like Fast and Furious from reaching maturity.Follow Matthew on TwitterJoin
