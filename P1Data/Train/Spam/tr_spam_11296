 the question really becomes, what do we do about this?Ive been 
here 18 years, Feinstein continued. Ive watched the BATF get beaten up 
at every turn on the road. And, candidly, its just not right.During 
that hearing, Feinstein advocated for using Operation Fast and Furious as a 
springboard from which to advocate for strict gun control laws, including national 
databases and government-controlled firearms registration. She argued that new laws could prevent 
future programs like Fast and Furious from reaching maturity.Follow Matthew on TwitterJoin

TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of 
Albania's commitment to accountability and the rule of law."A Council of Europe 
report by Swiss politician Dick Marty alleged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army ran detention centers on Albania's border during neighboring Kosovo's war for 
independence from Serbia. It says civilian captives, including Serbs, were killed there 
and their organs sold on the black market.Both Kosovo and Albania have 
denied those allegations.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">r, ATK completed a full-scale test of Liberty's five-segment solid motor  
the world's largest solid rocket motor, which was originally designed to be 
the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will 
use the original Ares 1 engine as a first stage and European 
aerospace firm Astrium's workhorse Ariane 5 rocket as the second stage. The 
massive Liberty rocket will tower at 300 feet (91 meters) tall, company 
officials have said. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]"Liberty can 
lift more than any other system," Rominger said. "Our capabilities can carry 
seven crew and significant cargo, which I think is unique. We really 
are a launch system designed for the 21st century to bring better 
reliability and safety."With NASA's space shuttle fleetretired (the last shuttle missions flew 
in 2011), th
 hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace
 identify potential Mitt Romney voters in the state, which has non-partisan 
voter registration.And Now, A Word From CharlesIt must say now this is 
another unique example of evolution in which a species evolves one way 
and turns around and goes back.That also hasn't been seen, at least 
recently, meaning the last million years or so.-- Charles Krauthammer on Special 
Report with Bret Baier.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News,
