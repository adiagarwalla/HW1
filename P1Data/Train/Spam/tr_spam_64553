threat is an issue of increasing significance to coalition forces and Afghan

it now seeks corrective action for the whistleblowers and disciplinary action against 
the agency officials who engaged in prohibited personnel practices," the statement read. 
"OSC is working with the Air Force to provide relief to these 
whistleblowers."The three officials who allegedly retaliated against the whistleblowers were not identified. 
One of the officials is an active duty military member while the 
other two are civilians.Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said she applauded the whistleblowers 
for their "courage" in coming forward."We expect the Air Force will now 
take appropriate steps to discipline the wrongdoers and deter future acts of 
retaliation," Lerner said in a statement.In a statement to FoxNews.com, Senate Armed

late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said
