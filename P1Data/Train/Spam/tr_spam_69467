oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
