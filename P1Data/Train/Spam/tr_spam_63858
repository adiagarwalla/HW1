Get deep
 Admittedly it's kinda sad that the only time your man really wants a deep and 
meaningful, is when it's him in your mouth.

 Welcome to deep throating. Yep - there's nothing that will make him feel more 
porntastic, manly and damn right http://www.modstroy.ru/minting macho than seeing his c**k disappear into the 
depths of you mouth.

 Great for him, but not so great for you. We have a very delicate gag reflex and 
stuffing anything into our mouths that far should be done with extreme caution. 

 Remember you don't have to deep throat to give him a mind blowing BJ, but if 
you're able to give him the visual delight of seeing you devour his dick then you'll 
definitely gain extra x-rated bedroom points.

 So how is it done? 

 Well, in most porn movies it's a combination of camera tricks, clever editing and 
well practiced porn star skills. In reality you're not expected to play penis peek-
a-boo for that long.
