<p>" "Very true, indeed;-and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to say in behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business?-Do clear them too, or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody." "Laugh as much as you chuse, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father's favourite in such a manner,-one, whom his father had promised to provide for.-It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him? oh! no." "I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley's being imposed on, than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night; names, facts, every thing mentioned without ceremony.-If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks." "It is difficult indeed-it is distressing.-One does not know what to think."
