! Johnny Depp came under fire when he compared photo shoots with 
rape in an interview with Vanity Fair. Susan Sarandon referred to Pope 
Benedict XVI Joseph Ratzinger as a Nazi, when in fact he was 
involuntarily enrolled as a member of Hitler Youth, but unlike most of 
the other teenagers, Ratzinger refused to go to meetings, bringing economic hardship 
to his family. And 80s songstress Sinead OConnor took things even further 
by tweeting that she would perform a bloodbath if the Pope was 
to visit her home country of Ireland. She later said it was 
just a joke. Ha?#9. Alec BaldwinJust last week Baldwin was removed from 
an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his phone. The 
30 Rock star then took to Twitter to make disparaging remarks about 
the airline staff who then publically fired back by exposing his rude 
behavior. And it doesnt end there  the attendants are reportedly now 
pushing to have Baldwin listed on the carriers no-fly list, and want

spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and 
makes decisions, in a way that will give it vastly expanded power 
to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development,

ng cuts.The House version of the legislation -- priced at more than 
$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal 
drug testing and high school dropouts to get an equivalent to a 
GED. It also provides for the "doctor fix."In addition, the House legislation 
blocks an Environmental Protection Agency rule curbing pollution from industrial boilers and 
extends tax break for businesses buying equipment for 2012.Differences also lie in 
how to pay for the bill. The House bill wants to extend 
the current pay freeze on civilian federal workers for another year and 
requires them to contribute more toward their pensions; raises fee Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac charge for insuring mortgages; raises Medicare premiums paid by

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
 Foreign Affairs Intrude on 2012 Narrative; A Congressional Christmas PageantTurmoil Around the 
Globe Changes Discussion for Presidential ElectionKim Jung Un may feel it necessary 
in the future to precipitate a crisis to prove his mettle to 
other senior leaders or deflect attention from the regime's failings.-- Bruce Klingner, 
Asia policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, talking to Reuters.The last 
two elections were decided on domestic issues, while the three contests before 
that hinged on foreign policy and national security.As suggested by the news 
today  the death of the dictator of the nuclear-armed, neo-Stalinist state 
of North Korea, the unraveling of onetime ally Egypt, the unrest in 
Russia, the continued rise of Iran, the morass in Afghanistan and Pakistan 
and the ongoing failure of Europe  the next contest may see 
a return to the more typical balance between domestic and foreign concerns.The 
outbreak of a new war or a successful terroris
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
