Yale doctors discovered a way to reverse the effects of blurry vision

Just behind the iris and pupil lies the lens, which helps to focus light on the back of the eye. Most of the eye is filled with a clear gel called the vitreous. Light projects through the pupil and the lens to the back of the eye. The inside lining of the eye is covered by special light-sensing cells that are collectively called the retina. The retina converts light into electrical impulses. Behind the eye, the optic nerve carries these impulses to the brain. The macula is a small extra-sensitive area within the retina that gives central vision. It is located in the center of the retina and contains the fovea, a small depression or pit at the center of the macula that gives the clearest vision.

Play action video games. A scientific study published in 2007 showed that people who spent time playing action video games (e.g. Unreal Tournament) had better visual abilities (specifically, spatial resolution) than those who didn't. By spending a few hours a day over the course of months playing Unreal Tournament, people improved their ability to identify letters in clutter (a common ophthalmological test) by 20 percent. People who play non-action video games like Tetris do not realize these benefits.

Eat more carrots, but only if you're short on vitamin A. Night blindness and other eye problems can be caused by a vitamin A deficiency. If you're not getting enough vitamin A, then eating more sources of it (like carrots) can help. But if you're already getting sufficient vitamin A in your diet, it won't make any difference. In fact, getting too much of a specific type of vitamin A (retinoids, found in liver, fish oils containing liver, and butter) can be toxic, and might even cause cancer.

Don't strain your eyes too often.
Laser eye surgery may not give you 20/20 vision, and many people who receive it relapse within 6 months. There are far cheaper and more effective natural solutions to improving eye health</span></td></tr></table>
