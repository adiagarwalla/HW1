To have an edge
This may be an idiomatic expression, but sometimes, if an edge is a knife,
it can be quite literal.
It means to have a special advantage. Having a lot of intelligence can serve=
 as an edge, being rich, good looking, in a fight the guy, with the knife ha=
s the edge over the one
 who doesn't.

Is there a term for this in Spanish? I'm thinking tener la ventaja sobre?

It can be with "la", but you have to add that "le"

le llevo (la) ventaja o llevarle (la) ventaja

Generally, vacation is American and holiday is English. So

When do you go on holiday?
When are you taking a holiday?

are correct.

I can't comment on
when do you take vacation time?
when do you get vacation time?

It can be with "la", but you have to add that "le"

le llevo (la) ventaja o llevarle (la) ventaja

Generally, vacation is American and holiday is English. So

When do you go on holiday?
When are you taking a holiday?

are correct.

I can't comment on
when do you take vacation time?
when do you get vacation time?
