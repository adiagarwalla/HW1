air of rainbows and a brilliant new star. Soviet records, however, indicate 
he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115
e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In 
2006, Chuck Wepner settled a three-year-old legal battle -- on undiscl
 sentenced to 120 days behind bars, but due to jail overcrowding 
served the sentence under house arrest. While under arrest, the Mean Girls 
star failed a random alcohol test, and later violated court-ordered community service. 
She was slapped with yet another jail sentence (her fifth in four 
years) but again spent a mere few hours in the clink. Lohan 
has been ordered to spend most of her days doing community service 
at the L.A. County morgue, but even on her first day in 
attendance she couldnt manage to arrive on time, despite stern warnings from 
the Judge, and was turned away in disgust. Plus she posed nude 
for Playboy!In almost any other year, this would have snagged her the 
top spot easy, but in 2011 she had some extra special competition...#1.

out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011,
