The ladies on The View are looking good.  See how they lost 25 in 4 weeks, here,
http://search.completelylossbellyfats.click
Order by 1/17/15.

Since it was lunch time we decided on 21429456 sandwiches and fries. My husband got the riot burger and I must say this is a must order. The riot burger has fried oysters & delicious bacon. This burger is no joke in size and must be cut in half to eat. I ordered the seared salmon burger and was a little disappointed. It was a decent size burger but the salmon burger seemed to have a lot of filler and it was more like a crab cake. I thought it was a little bit too fishy and I love salmon. I would probably try something else next time.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">My husband, a friend and I recently visited Old Ebbitt Grill on the advice of several different locals. We made reservations for 21429456 Tuesday at 7 pm. We arrived promptly at 7 to a VERY crowded restaurant. We were given a pager, ordered a drink at the bar and were seated in a booth at 7:15. OEG is the most spacious restaurant we have visited in DC. It's the first restaurant we've visited that didn't seem at least slightly cramped.

We started with  cocktails and appetizers. 21429456 My husband ordered the hot crab dip, which he liked but said was VERY rich (better for sharing).,Our friend ordered the calamari. He said it was tasty, but it came with an unexpected component. The calamari was piled on top of a pepper mixture, including jalapenos. He said the jalapenos were NOT included in the menu description of the dish. He was only made aware of this ingredient when he accidentally got a jalapeno seed on a piece of calamari. Fortunately he likes jalapenos. I ordered the chopped salad. I didn't like it and wouldn't order it again.

For our entrees, my husband c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f and I shared the spinach and cheese stuffed canneloni and our friend ordered the crab cakes. Our friend said the crab cakes were awesome. My husband and I found the canneloni was fabulous. DEFINITELY worth repeating.

For dessert, my husband and 21429456 I shared the Blondie with ice cream and our friend ordered the pear crisp. Both dishes were great and worth ordering again. We found this to be VERY reasonable for the level of food quality and service we received.

Our service for the meal was on par. 21429456 Our glasses never went empty, our food was delivered with no noticeable delay between courses and our finished dishes were removed promptly. Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.

Overall we had a great experience at OEG. Even with the surprise in one appetizer and my dislike of the chopped salad, we would DEFINITELY recommend this restaurant to friends. We will also be returning next year (during our annual trip to DC) to try the brunch menu.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
