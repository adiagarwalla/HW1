Never having been a big breakfast eater, 16296842 I'm not one to go nuts for breakfast food. The cinnamon roll pancakes however, may have swayed me. While Wildberry offers a full menu, I only ordered the cinnamon roll pancakes and coffee. I left satisfied and pleased with my selection, however I look forward to returning to try more of the menu. The ambience is charming, and the service was quick, while still maintaining a warm and friendly vibe. Cheers Wildberry!.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c

Thankfully we came on our last day here, 16296842 on a Monday morning with 75 degree sunny weather. They also have outdoor seating for days like this. The place was still pretty busy around 1 pm. It's also a great spot because Millennium park is right across the street.

They don't seat you until your entire party is there. 16296842 There was no wait except waiting for the other half of our group to arrive. I read from other reviews the wait can be very long. I recommend either coming early if planned for brunch on a weekend or try coming on a weekday. They DON'T take reservations.

Their menu is quite extensive and entails a variety of pancakes, crepes, waffles, french toast, omelettes, benedicts, scrambles, skillets, sandwiches and salads. They also serve Intelligentisia coffee.

We ordered their signature Berry Bliss French Toast, the Butchers Block Skillet with a side of Red Velvet French Toast, and the corn beef hash Skillet with a side of the banana cream pie pancakes. f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. 

All the french toast and pancakes were soft and fluffy with loads of flavor and not overwhelmingly sweet. 16296842 The red velvet french toast had a nice cream cheese filling between the slices of french toast making it just like red velvet. The banana cream pie and a nice banana cream filling between the pancakes giving it more banana flavor in addition to the fresh slices of bananas. The cinnamon sugar sprinkles were also a nice touch. The HIGHLIGHT was the berry bliss french toast with a nice berry yogurt glaze between the toasts with loads of berry flavor and the vanilla anglaise was superb. 

The skillets came out piping hot! The corn beef was very good, chopped to fine pieces. The only thing they could have improved on was pan fry the corn beef a bit to crisp some of the pieces adding a texture like bacon bits to it, but I was a very happy camper with the corned beef hash skillet. I thought they did an amazing job. The butchers block was also very good with a good variety of meats that were juicy and packed with loads of flavor. Both skillets came with perfectly cooked sunnyside up eggs.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
