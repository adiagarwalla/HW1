ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA - Two men who murdered honeymooning British couple Ben 
and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly 
after being shot in the back of the head. Her husband, a 
physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.
inly hope that's right because if the Russians have provided Iran with 
sophisticated jamming equipment it means a lot else is at risk too."Of 
course, given the secretive nature of the mission and the RQ-170 drone 
itself, the truth may never emerge -- and may even be something 
purely mundane."It's entirely possible the aircraft ran out of gas and malfunctioned 
independent of any Iranian electronic interference," Trimble told FoxNews.com.Predators, Demons and More:

WASHINGTON  A Nebraska meatpacker recalled more than 40,000 pounds of ground 
beef products distributed in 16 states after a test confirmed the presence 
of E. coli, the Agriculture Department said Friday.The products were shipped to 
institutions and distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., recalled 10-pound chubs of 
chuck fine ground beef 80/20, packed in cases containing eight chubs.USDA's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement that the problem was 
discovered through routine monitoring that confirmed a positive result for E. coli. 
No reports of illness have been received.E. coli is a bacterium that 
can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in the most severe cases, kidney 
failure. The very young, the elderly and those with weak immune systems

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to
 derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
nthal Center had a similar assessment."When it comes to the charges of 
being 'Israel Firsters' and having 'dual loyalty,' we not only plead innocent 
but also counter-charge that these sponsored bloggers are guilty of dangerous political 
libels resonating with historic and toxic anti-Jewish prejudices," the center said in 
a statement first distributed to The Washington Post.The center described the accusation 
as the kind of "odious charges" that have been around since before 
World War II.Other writings by the two groups have also come under 
scrutiny.Think Progress claimed in August that the American Israel Public Affairs Committee 
(AIPAC), a pro-Israel lobby, was banging the war drums on Iran."It would 
appear that AIPAC is now using the same escalating measures against Iran 
that were used before the invasion of Iraq," the article read, citing 
an AIPAC letter in support of congressional calls to sanction Iran's Central 
Bank.A subsequent ThinkProgress post describe
