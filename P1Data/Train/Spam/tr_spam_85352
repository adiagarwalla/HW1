rs of a second round, saying it would lead to a "certain 
destabilization of the political situation." The need for stability in Russia has 
been the mantra of Putin's campaign.Putin won his previous two presidential terms 
in 2000 and 2004 in the first round. After moving into the 
prime minister's job due to term limits, he has remained Russia's top 
political figure, but has seen his support dwindle amid growing public frustration 
with his rigid controls over the political scene, rampant corruption and rising 
social inequality.Opinion polls show support for Putin running between 40 and 50 
percent. If he fails to get a majority of the vote, he 
will face a runoff on March 25, most likely against Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov.Putin announced his bid to reclaim the presidency in September 
and said he would then name Dmitry Medvedev, his protege and successor 
as president, as his prime minister. That job swap was seen as 
a show of cynical disrespect for th
APJan. 30: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin lights a cande as he 
visits the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery in the town of Tikhvin, about 106 
miles east of St. Petersburg.MOSCOW  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he 
could face a runoff in Russia's presidential vote in March -- his 
first acknowledgment that he may fail to muster enough support for an 
outright victory.Putin's statement Wednesday signaled that he might be willing to accept 
a less dominating father-of-the nation image if he fails to win more 
than 50 percent in the first round on March 4, rather than 
risk igniting more public outrage through blatant vote rigging.Evidence of fraud in 
favor of Putin's party in December's parliamentary election triggered the largest protests 
since the Soviet collapse two decades ago.Putin said at a meeting with 
election monitors that "there is nothing horrible" about a runoff and he's 
ready for one, according to Russian news reports.But he also warned of 
the dange
oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
 cing fashion. Romney lost in Iowa by a little and in South 
Carolina by a lot. But other than a couple of weeks when 
the Romneyites had visions of a January sweep, the frontrunners strategy had 
always been to hopscotch contests focusing on larger, more moderate states.So on 
the one hand, Romney is back on track. On the other hand, 
its a wholly different track than weve ever seen a Republican nominee 
follow before and with a very unpredictable GOP electorate.This isnt the NFL: 
you dont have to win all your playoff games to get to 
the Super Bowl. Romneys decisive drubbing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
in big, diverse and expensive Florida is the frontrunners strongest statement of 
dominance so far. Its also proof that while the Romney campaign has 
made some tactical errors in recent weeks, their overall strategy is holding 
up.But the truth is, we wont start to know until the end 
of this month whether Romney is making his strategy stick.There are a 
hand
come to the conclusion that the extremists have been in charge," he 
said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible. 
So, our percentages, that's when they took a nice little jump," Paul 
said.But poll numbers do help frame the debate over invincibility, and with 
Romney holding a double-digit lead in Florida, and a strong position in 
national polls, as well as having considerable money in the bank, knocking 
him off his perch will be hard to do.That's why Gingrich has 
repeatedly suggested that Santorum get out of the race, saying that between 
the two of them, they poll better than Romney.But Santorum said that's 
not happening, and Gingrich shouldn't even ask.I don't think people
