Dear Beneficiary,

I hope that this correspondence is received with the urgency
and expediency required.

It has come to the notice of the Board of Trustees of the Federal
Reserve Bank here in Washington, D.C. that your present inheritance claims 
application being handled by the Remitting Bank in Nigeria is experiencing 
some man made irregularities.To this effect, it has become necessary for the 
Board of Trustees to assign trained Fund Transfer Specialists from the United 
States to resolve and regularize your fund release with immediate effect.

We at Peter Simons & Consults have been duly consulted by the
FRB Board of Trustees. We have been fully informed about how the
staff of the remitting bank has been taking advantage of you by
telling you to pay unnecessarily exorbitant charges which will only
make your fund payment a long drawn out process.

Due to this development, we have been assigned to step into the 
immediate processing of your fund transfer to enable your funds to be 
transferred to you within the shortest possible time. To implement this, 
you are to get back to us immediately without needing to pay all the 
huge sums of monies that are being demanded from you by the previous
handlers at the remitting bank.

All processes to have your funds paid to you immediately through the CBN's 
Liaison Remittance Office in Los Angeles, California. have been initiated
to cut out unnecessary costs.You are advised to treat this communication
with the urgency and seriousness required as the Board of Trustees of the
Federal Reserve Bank has mandated us to resolve this fund payment within
the next three working days independent of the office of the Remitting Bank
in Africa.

Furthermore,you are hereby advised to pay no further fees or charges to the
Remitting Bank in Nigeria as they shall no longer be handling your payment
process.

We shall await your immediate correspondence with your direct telephone numbers
to my private email address at (peter.simons1@aol.com) for re-confirmation so that 
we may conclude your payment immediately.

Yours Sincerely,
Peter Simons.
Peter Simons & Consults.
