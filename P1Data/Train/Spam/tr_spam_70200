Europe.Instead, U.S. military capabilities will in the future concentrate on Asian security 
risks such as China and North Korea, and build on partnerships in 
the Middle East to keep an eye on Iran. As a result, 
the Pentagon will withdraw two of America's four combat brigades still based 
in Europe."President Obama has announced sharp cuts and shift of focus to 
Middle East and Asia ... so now the tempo of European cooperation 
has to accelerate," said Claude-France Arnould, who heads the EU's defense agency.She 
said support functions such as the joint maintenance of aircraft and training 
of air crews can deliver quick savings.The European Defense Agency also is 
working on a number of programs to address deficiencies identified during the 
war in Libya, including improving the performance of air tanker fleets, standardizing

contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
