Hello,

RE: INVESTMENT AND BUSINESS PARTNERSHIP PROPOSAL.

I represent a group of companies and very high net-worth individuals, based in the oil rich Persian Gulf Region of Qatar, UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. We are seeking means  of expanding and relocating our business interests further  abroad, in the following sectors -Real Estate, Banking,  Manufacturing, Oil and Gas, Stock Speculation and Mining,  Transportation, Health Care Delivery and IT ? Communications Services, Agriculture - Forestry /Fishing, Food Processing and indeed in any other sector, that is legitimate.

If you have a solid background and idea of how to make good profit in any of the mentioned business sectors, or indeed any other sector/business in your country, or elsewhere, please write me, for possible business co-operation.

More-so, we are ready to facilitate and fund any business that is capable of generating good Annual Returns on Investment (AROI), on Joint Venture Partnership basis.  Hard Loan Funding may also be considered.

Write me, via Email: hamzaidris1973@pisem.net if you are interested and serious.

Regards,

Mr. Hamza Idris
