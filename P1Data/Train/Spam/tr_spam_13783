<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">THE BEST MEDITERRANEAN PLACE IN LOS ANGELES. EVER. 

I've had my handful of Mediterranean 4187578 food but I have never had it like Pita Bar & Grill. Everything here is delicious and the service is amazing. 

>From the outside, this place looks nothing special. It's small, has tiny tables and seating, and no special ambiance to the place. However, you are immediately greeted by THE friendliest man (pretty sure he is the owner) and your perception of the restaurant is immediately changed. 

The man is constantly smiling and 4187578 recommends you of certain dishes/drinks that he thinks you will like. I ordered the chicken kebob plate and got the mint lemonade to drink. 

You have to get the mint lemonade!!! It's so refreshing and not too sweet or too minty. I have never had a lemonade like this but I kept coming back to get refills and he gave them to me for free. He's such a sweet man!

The chicken kebob plate though 9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a was a life changing moment for me. The plate comes with a salad, rice, hummus, and pita. Everything on the plate was unlike any other plate I have had. it was authentic, homemade, and absolutely delightful. The chicken was most, flavorful, and tender. It was seasoned to perfection and you gotta smother it with a little bit of hummus and one of their many sauces to get the perfect bite. Their pita here is also amazing. It is served warm and their pita here is a little different. It's a little thicker and sturdier so it can handle all of the meat, sauces, and vegetables you want to hold in your pita. 

They also have a pickled vegetable stand, 4187578 off to the side, where they offer you pickled carrots, onions, cabbage, etc. Everything is so colorful, crunchy, and adds some tangy flavor to your food. I couldn't stop eating their carrots, it was so addicting. 

You have to try this place! Trust me, you will not regret it. All of the guests at the restaurant were thanking the man for such an amazing and delicious dining experience.9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a
