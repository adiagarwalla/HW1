Dec. 8, 2011: Images aired by Iranian state television show the secret 
U.S. drone that went down last week in eastern Iran. WASHINGTON  
A U.S. official says Iran will find it hard to exploit any 
data and technology aboard the captured CIA stealth drone because of measures 
taken to limit the intelligence value of drones operating over hostile territory.The 
official also said Saturday that despite Iran's latest claims to have hijacked 
the RQ-170 Sentinel and brought it down near the eastern Iranian city 
of Kashmar, the U.S. is convinced that the drone malfunctioned."The Iranians had

December 17, 2011: This surveillance photo provided by the New York (City) 
Police Dept. shows a suspect wanted in connection with a homicide, in 
the Brooklyn borough of New York. A New York City man was 
arrested and charged with murder after allegedly burning an elderly woman to 
death inside her apartment building elevator over $2,000 he claims she owed 
him.Authorities said that when 73-year-old Deloris Gillespie went up the elevator to 
her fifth-floor Brooklyn apartment on Saturday, carrying groceries, suspect Jerome Isaac was 
waiting.Surveillance video from inside the small elevator shows 47-year-old Isaac looked something 
like an exterminator, with a canister sprayer, white gloves and a dust 
mask, which was perched atop his head like a pair of sunglasses. 
The sprayer was full of flammable liquid.When the elevator opened Saturday afternoon, 
the suspect sprayed the woman, who turned around and crouched down to 
try to protect herself, New York Police Department
