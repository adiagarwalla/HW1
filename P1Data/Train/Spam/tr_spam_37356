killed for struggling to win the land for the villagers. We all 
cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac 
failure.Problems in Wukan erupted in violence in September, when hund
providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears. 
Youll truly feel like youre on top of the Buri Khalifa with 
Cruise.Hope youre not afraid of

ballot showed that "the FDP's grass roots are deeply divided on the 
government's course.""The FDP's days of chaos are far from over," she predicted.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
  been given warnings, officials said. About 40 students had been gathering 
in the hallway all week emulating Tebow.School administrators said the stunt jammed 
the hallway, creating a fire hazard.This is not about religious discrimination, Riverhead 
School District Superintendent Nancy Carney told the Post. It is about being 
sure kids are able to get to class on time and keeping 
the kids safe and orderly.Click here to read more on this report 
from the New York Post.
