t to attend the NATO summit, as Russian leaders sometimes do by 
invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the 
sidelines of another economic gathering, the larger G-20 summit in Mexico.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from

n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
DAMASCUS, Syria  Two suicide car bombs ripped through the Syrian capital 
Thursday, killing 55 people and tearing the facade off a military intelligence 
building in the deadliest explosions since the country's uprising began 14 months 
ago, the Interior Ministry said.Residents told an Associated Press reporter that the 
blasts happened in quick succession during morning rush hour, with an initial 
small explosion followed by a larger bomb that appeared aimed at onlookers 
and rescue crews arriving at the scene. Paramedics wearing rubber gloves collected 
human remains from the pavement as heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks 
smoldered.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's blasts. But an al-Qaida-inspired 
group has claimed responsibility for several past explosions, raising fears that terrorist 
groups are entering the fray and exploiting the chaos.In addition to the 
55 dead, the ministry also said there were 15 bags of human 
remains, meaning the death

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
 ff the dinner with a contest in which supporters can register to 
win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop 
singer who is now a Broadway star. The fundraiser is for Obamas 
dedicated gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender coalition. Its hard to ask people 
to fork over $30,000 while simultaneously expl
esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
