Are You Prepared for the Worst Market Crash Ever?

U.S. Investor zhangzhizong@fs.net,

I've realized there are glearing warning signals for an "unavoidable market crash." There is a 70 percent chance it's coming - and it will bring on a 25-year depression.

Colleagues at the CIA are getting ready for a meltdown in the wake of this trillion-dollar-crisis.  I want you to be prepared. 

I'd like to rush you a complimentary copy of my book, The Death of Money, which will include the controversial unpublished chapter, and will prepare you for this change. 

To protect yourself from this unavoidable depression, get a free copy of the book here now.

Nothing short of phenomenal 7897575 perfection.
Every dish was done perfectly with great flavors.

We started with a couple cocktails, I got a bourbon-based cocktail with some mint and sweet tea flavors which was delicious and went down super smoothly. Very strong as well. The gf got a cocktail that basically 7897575 tasted like liquid pistachio ice cream, said it was great.

We then had the tuna tacos 7897575 which were absolutely heavenly. I loved the wasabi based sauce which pervaded teh tacos and the tuna was plentiful. Three-four massive chunks of top quality tuna made for a superb start to the meal.

For her entree, my gf had the miso salmon served over lobster mashed. I can't eat lobster, but the mashed potatoes looked great with massive chunks of lobster. The salmon was good and cooked very well with not an overpowering soy flavor.f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb
