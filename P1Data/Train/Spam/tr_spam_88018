<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.01.—Stewed Breast of Lamb.

Cut a breast of lamb into small pieces, season, and stew until tender in enough gravy to cover the meat. Thicken the sauce, flavor with a wine-glass of wine, pile in the centre of a platter and garnish with green peas.
2.—Chicken Creams.

Chop and pound ½ a lb. of chicken and 3 ozs. of ham; pass this through a sieve, add 1 oz. of melted butter, 2 well-beaten eggs, and ½ a pint of cream, which must be whipped; season with pepper and salt. Mix all lightly together, put into oiled moulds and steam fifteen minutes, or if in one large mould half an hour.
3.—Herring's Roes on Toast.

Have rounds of toast buttered and seasoned with salt and pepper, on each [Pg 2]piece place ½ the soft roe of a herring which has been slightly fried and on the top of this a fried mushroom. Serve very hot.
4.—French Omelet.

For a very small omelet beat 2 whole eggs and the yokes of two more until a full spoonful can be taken up. Add 3 tablespoonfuls of water, ¼ of a teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper, and when well mixed turn into a hot omelet pan, in which a tablespoonful of butter has been melted, lift the edges up carefully and let the uncooked part run under. When all is cooked garnish with parsley.
5.—Cheese Ramequins.

Melt 1 oz. of butter, mix with ½ oz. of flour, add ¼ of a pint of milk, stir and cook well. Then beat in the yolks of two eggs, sprinkle in 3 ozs. of grated cheese, add the well-beaten whites of three eggs. Mix in lightly and put in cases. Bake a quarter of an hour.
6.—Scotch Collops.

Cut cold roast veal into thin slices, and dust over them a little mace, [Pg 3]nutmeg, cayenne, and salt, and fry them in a little butter. Lay on a dish and make a gravy by adding 1 tablespoonful of flour, ¼ of a pint of water, 1 teaspoonful of anchovy sauce, 1 tablespoonful of lemon juice, ¼ of a teaspoonful of lemon peel, 3 tablespoonfuls of cream, and 1 of sherry. Let boil up once and pour over the meat. Garnish with lemon and parsley.
