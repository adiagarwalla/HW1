      Your doctor has probably told you fish oil is great for heart health.<br>
      <br>
      But they probably didn’t tell you, because they don’t know, that<br>
      fish oil can be VERY dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      Many fish oils are made with toxic farmed fish that live and grow<br>
      in their own feces.<br>
      <br>
      Others have mercury contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Most all of them give you disgusting “fish burps.”<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, for those of us deathly <a href="http://notformom.com/19sz21526f1"><strong><u>
		afraid of having a heart attack</u></strong></a>,<br>
      <br>
      there’s something pure from the most remote regions of earth that<br>
      is WAY more powerful than fish oil.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the fish oil companies stand to lose BILLIONS because of this<br>
      secret nutrient I’m about to reveal.<br>

<p> I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for me to be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general astonish-and perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else.-Here you are in your own family." "Upon my word I say no more here than I might say in any house in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He is not at all liked in Hertfordshire. Every body is disgusted with his pride. You will not find him more favourably spoken of by any one." "I cannot pretend to be sorry," said Wickham, after a short interruption, "that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts; but with him I believe it does not often happen. The world is blinded by his fortune and consequence, or frightened by his high and imposing manners, and sees him only as he chuses to be seen." "I should take him, even on my slight acquaintance, to be an ill-tempered man." Wickham only shook his head. "I wonder," said he, at the next opportunity of speaking, "whether he is likely to be in this country much longer. I have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge.
