in South Florida, but it does lend some credence to his campaign 
strategy that with a lot of delegate-rich southern states to vote next 
month, Gingrich has time to wait for the next gust of wind 
to fill his sails.Florida certainly narrowed Gingrichs chances, but it certainly didnt 
end them. Weve got at least five more crazy weeks to go.Chris 
Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY

JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators

NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> score for early Sunday had been forecast to be a 6 
in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
 ent will remain at 7 percent or above through 2015The new figures 
also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand

and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What

however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much
