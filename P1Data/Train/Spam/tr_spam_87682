demanding a just share of the prosperity of our country, provided the union is governed by the same spirit that {523} should actuate men who profess the guidance of a Christian conscience.

In the present status of capital and labor there should be mutual interests; and at the same time workmen should realize that there is a limit to the pressure which capital can endure by the demands made upon it. Competition has always given some measure of relief to the laborer by the demands of capital for human service, and men should not therefore abandon themselves to the supposed power of arbitrary demands which labor unions are now making in many cases upon their employers. The contention for the recognition of unions is often a very indefinite factor, for no one seems to know just what that recognition means now, or what it is to mean in the future. If recognition means the exclusive right of any class of men to gain a livelihood by their work, then recognition should be persistently and forcefully resisted.

The Latter-day Saints, whether in the unions or out of them, know very well whether individual or united demands are arbitrary and unjust, and they will lose nothing by a manly refusal to violate their sense of justice.�Juvenile Instructor, Vol. 38, June, 1903, p. 370.

CAUSE OF WAR. The condition of the world today presents a spectacle that is deplorable, so far as it relates to the religious convictions, faith and power of the inhabitants of the earth. Here we have nations arrayed against nations, and yet in every one of these nations are so-called 

Christian peoples professing to worship the same God, professing to possess belief in the same divine Redeemer, many of them professing to be teachers of God's word, and ministers of life and salvation to the children of men, and yet these nations are divided one against the other, and each is praying to his God for wrath upon and victory over his enemies and for his own preservation. Would it be possible, could it be possible, for this condition to exist if {524} the people of the world possessed really the true knowledge of the gospel of Jesus Christ? And if they really possessed the Spirit of the living God�could this condition exist? No; it could not exist, but war would cease, and contention and strife would be at an end. And not only the spirit of war would not exist, but the spirit of contention and strife that now exists among the nations of the earth, which is the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though perhaps it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly.

Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.

Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper, or her affectionate heart. The darling wish of his sisters was then gratified; he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.

Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia's example, she became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia's society she was of course carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.

Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet's being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters' beauty and her own, it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance.

As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope that Darcy

Both trials demonstrated statistically significant improvements in ADHD-RS-IV scores in patients taking INTUNIV beginning one to two weeks after patients began receiving once-daily doses of INTUNIV. In the first pivotal trial, the mean ction in ADHD-RS-IV total scores at end point were -16.7 for INTUNIV compared to -8.9 for placebo (P< .0001); the mean ction in ADHD-RS-IV total scores in the second pivotal trial were -19.6 for INTUNIV and -12.2 for placebo (P=.0040). Placebo-adjusted LS mean changes from baseline were statistically significant for all INTUNIV doses in the randomized treatment groups in both studies.

Additional secondary efficacy outcome measures included the Conners' Parent Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CPRS-R) and the Conners' Teacher Rating Scale-Revised: Short Form (CTRS-R). CPRS-R and CTRS-R are comprehensive scales that use parent and teacher observer and self-report ratings to help assess ADHD and evaluate behavioral issues in children and adolescents. Among some of the symptoms measured were: inattentiveness/being easily distracted, running around or climbing excessively, arguing with adults, losing temper, and interrupting or intruding on others. Significant improvements were seen on both scales: based on the CPRS-R, parents reported significant improvement across a full day (as measured at 6 PM, 8 PM, and 6 AM the next morning); based on the CTRS-R, which was used only in the first pivotal trial, teachers reported significant improvement throughout the school day (as measured at 10 AM and 2 PM).
