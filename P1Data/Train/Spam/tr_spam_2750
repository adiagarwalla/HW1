If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a

NEW YORK  Some 55 people have been charged with forming a 
New York City fraud ring that used members' jobs at a prominent 
charity and other places to steal financial information from wealthy donors and 
customers.Arraignments were expected Friday in the case.Prosecutors say in indictments that participants 
in the scheme had jobs that involved processing donor or customer checks. 
One worked at the UJA-Federation, a major Jewish charity.Prosecutors say she and 
other members of the ring harvested people's personal information from the checks 
and provided it to accomplices.Then the accomplices would forge checks, deposit them 
in still other associates' bank accounts and withdraw the money as soon 
as it cleared.UJA-Federation says it worked with authorities and fired the employee.
 McQueary, but that McQueary never reported seeing anal intercourse or other 
sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young 
boys genitals."Under cross-examination, McQueary said he considered what he saw a crime 
but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and 
Curley didn't testify, but Judge Wenner read their grand jury testimony from 
January in weighing the case.Sandusky says he is innocent of more than 
50 charges stemming from what authorities say were sexual assaults over 12 
years on 10 boys in

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
 If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
test detective can find the clue to salvage the franchise.
