aid the charge could only be misinterpreted by those "desperately" trying to 
change the topic.Suggesting he may have spoken "inartfully" last week, Christie then 
called Gusciora a "numbnuts" for trying to compare him to segregationist-era Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace and Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox."What I said was I'm 
sure that civil rights advocates would like to have had this as 
another option but it was not available to them and the reason 
it wasn't -- although I didn't say this -- was because the 
political climate wasn't advantageous to even consider doing this," Christie told NJ.com 
and other reporters who attended the Statehouse briefing."Yet you have numbnuts like 
Reed Gusciora, who put out a statement, you know, comparing me to 
George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Now, you know, come on guys at 
some point you have got to be able to call BS on 
those kinds of press releases. There are any number of you in 
this room who may have quarrels with my policies, bu
other sanctions. But Moscow says it could lay the groundwork for later 
military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's 
stance is motivated in part by its strategic and defense ties, including 
weapons sales, with Syria. Russia also rejects what it sees as a

largest unauthorized outpost, set for next month would not be affected by 
the formation of the new committee, officials said.But the panel's makeup aroused 
suspicions it would legalize at least some of the more than 100 
outposts built without government authorization, including dozens Sasson says were erected on 
privately held Palestinian land.The committee's head, former Supreme Court chief justice Edmond 
Levy, spoke out against Israel's withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip 
in 2005. A second panel member, Alan Baker, has represented settlers hoping 
to legalize unauthorized outposts.The international community opposes all Jewish settlement activity in 
the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 
1967 Mideast war. But Israel distinguishes between the 121 settlements established in 
accordance with official prores and the more than 100 unauthorized "outposts" that 
skirted the process with the help of sympathetic authorities and are con

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WAYNESBURG, Pa.  Police in southwestern Pennsylvania say a woman who appeared 
to not have any teeth in surveillance photos from a bank robbery 
last month has confessed, apologized and said she planned the heist because 
she needed the money for dentures.Forty-nine-year-old Evelyn Marie Fuller, of Carmichaels, was 
arrested Tuesday by police in Waynesburg, where she's charged with robbing the 
First National Bank on Jan. 20.The Observer-Reporter of Washington, Pa. (http://bit.ly/wPOQCm ) 
reports Wednesday that Fuller told a district judge she has mental health 
problems and lives on disability.After her arraignment, Fuller told a reporter, "I'm 
very sorry for what I did and I know God is going 
to punish me for it." Fuller says her pastor told her to 
tell the truth about what she did.___Information from: Observer-Reporter, http://www.observer-reporter.com
 APFeb. 1: Israel's President Shimon Peres, left, and United Nations Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon are seen reflected in a door's mirror as they speak 
at a Jerusalem hotel.JERUSALEM  The U.N. chief has told Israel the 
international standoff over Iran's suspect nuclear program must be resolved peacefully.Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon delivered his message at a time of growing concerns that Israel 
could be planning an attack on Iran. Israel, like the West, believes 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons and says no option, including force, can 
be ruled out in stopping it. Iran insists its nuclear program is 
peacefulAt a news conference with Israel's prime minister, Ban urged the Iranians 
to prove their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked whether 
he fears an Israeli attack, he said "there is no alternative to 
a peaceful resolution of these issues."U.N. nuclear inspectors said Wednesday they would 
soon return to Tehran after a "good trip" to the Iranian
percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
