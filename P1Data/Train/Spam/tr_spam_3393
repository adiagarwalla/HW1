Suffering from thinning hair?

 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
roject to get moving, citing the thousands of jobs it could create. 
The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed 
put Obama in another politically sticky si
f pushing through the payroll tax measure over conservative objections in order 
to keep the pressure on the Senate. In fact, it was the 
passage of the House version of the payroll holiday that convinced Democrats 
to go ahead and fund the government.While he may have discussed a 
failsafe option of a short extension, it seems unlikely that Boehner would 
have climbed down so quickly after his victory. Furthermore, the idea that 
any negotiator would take the first counteroffer with the deadline for talks 
still weeks away is just silly.Congress never does anything before it absolutely 
has to or until it starts to inconvenience its members, so that 
suggests that there are at least five days this week before the 
standoff begins to imperil Christmas plans and 13 days before anything happens 
to workers paychecks. The House Republicans have long expected to be working 
this week and clearly have no intention of reaching a compromise until 
their time has run out.Plus, Rep

North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea 
is the hardest dictatorship in our time."
 0 a year for a $400,000 mortgage. Homeowners would have the fee 
hike built into their loan -- the mortgage provider would then send 
that extra revenue to the Treasury.The idea behind the fee is to 
encourage more homeowners to get into the private market, as opposed to 
seeking loans backed by troubled entities like Fannie and Freddie."Taxpayers are losing 
every quarter on Fannie and Freddie," a senior Senate Democratic aide said. 
"We want to lessen the burden on the taxpayers (who are on 
the hook for failed government-backed loans)."The aide added, "This is an incentive 
to go to the private-sector mortgage market."A fact sheet on the Senate 
bill sent out Saturday to House Republicans noted that the offset has 
"bipartisan support" and was included in the House GOP-backed payroll tax cut 
bill. It also was included in President Obama's list of suggestions to 
the now-defunct "Super Committee" tasked with cing the deficit.The House still must 
vote on the bill.Th

negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
