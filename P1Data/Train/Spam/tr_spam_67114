a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from

 esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
 With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue 
this week the case should be heard in U.S. District Court in 
Portland. In the modern day, air travel is absolutely fundamentally important to 
how we travel on a daily basis, says ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury, 
and that right to travel is protected by the Constitutions promise of
