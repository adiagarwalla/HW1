by their employers over the summer, the protests have continued unabated.Kasymov said 
that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and 
the local branch of the governing Nur Otan party, Kasymov said.Kasymov said 
police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every 
police officer took the decision themselves. When they take a weapon off 
you, there is no need for an order to be issued," Kasymov 
said.He also insisted tha
 presidential race for 2012, Rokita warned that officials need to safeguard the 
integrity of the country's electoral process."You really need honest people in both 
parties looking after this process, this process only works when people are 
civically engaged, including party members and party workers who are paid, in 
this case, by the county to make sure the signatures are checked."He 
also suggested that photo ID "would be the stopgap that catches some 
of these things, like ACORN in 2008, when they were filing fraudulent 
voter registrations."Although photo ID, a controversial measure in other states, may not 
have been applicable to petition signatures, the Democratic chairman of St. Joseph 
County has proposed measures intended to prevent any wrong doing in the 
collection of signatures that is underway now.State Sen. John Broden has suggested 
instituting random audits of signatures, a system of verifying their authenticity and 
keeping track of who collected signatu

on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia
