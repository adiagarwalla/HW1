They forage and source local Austrian ingredients but the way they prorate their dishes is influenced by global cuisines.  5674252 I made a lunch reservation a few weeks in advance via their website since bf and I were going to be in Vienna on a Euro trip. They offer a 4 course lunch pre fixe which was 78 Euros a person and a little more if you want to do the 5 course which includes cheese. The four course is dessert or cheese. You choose your course based on the way they laid out the menu (there's a section for mains, starters etc) 

The service, as you might imagine, 5674252 is impeccable and each server obsesses in details on what goes into your dish. We had no issues communicating because we did not speak German - though I think this place is actually full with mostly natives. There are so many servers and I bet even more in the kitchen.  You also get little cards that talks about each dish as you eat.  There is also a cart for drinks and bread (which goes around often- so feel free to try it as much as you want, they have many varieties).   I started with a glass of the Austrian white mustalker (sp?) - very clean and crisp.  We also had two refreshing bottles of still water that was kept extra cold.  The food is fun to eat, interesting and good for those into gastronomy. 

Also regarding the decor; extremely modern, 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e futuristic but with plenty of nature touches with a live herb garden, and tons of organic products for sale. You can also see a lot of the action due to the big windows and yes the bathrooms are unique and super clean.  The silver they use is even futuristic, with a super modern decor and while seem hard to handle is actually fitting for their dish ware and food. 

Firstly the bread cart- they have about 8-10 varieties and 3 butters. While I can't remember all the ones we samples (rye, honey wheat, Olive, sourdough, Etc) the one that we enjoyed the most was the famous bacon bread which had cubes of bacon inside pillowy, yeasty, bread. The butters are also amazing- one plain Austrian butter which was pure and amazing, one infused with corn and yellow pepper so a bit sweet, and one with popcorn inside.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
