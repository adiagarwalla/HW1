on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and

 when a zip lining accident went from bad to much, much worse. 
Just one week ago, Aimee was enjoying a trip kayaking down a 
creek with some of her friends in Carrollton, Ga. But when she 
stopped to ride on a homemade zip line along the water, the 
line snapped and cut a large gash in her left calf.Initially, Aimee 
had gone to the emergency room at the Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton on Tuesday after she had received the gash. She thought the 
ordeal was over after the doctors stapled her leg up with 22 
staples and told her to take pain medication, according to her father.But 
Aimee returned to the hospital Wednesday after she continued to complain of 
severe pain in her leg. She was prescribed pain killers and sent 
home yet again.The pain still did not subside, so a friend drove 
a pale and weak Aimee to Tanner Medical again Friday morning. When 
she arrived, an ER doctor diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis  a

CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
