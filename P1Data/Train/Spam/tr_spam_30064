ers. All 45 people on board were feared dead.Due to the remoteness 
of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia 
as part of a six-nation tour of Asia aimed at drumming up 
new customers.It was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists 
on what was supposed to be a quick, 50-minute demonstration flight Wednesday. 
Some excited passengers snapped pictures of themselves smiling and waving in front 
of the twin-
s questioned two wealthy supporters, Fred and Lisa Blue Baron, on why 
they had flown Hunter on private jets and taken her shopping."Her mindset 
to me was she didn't think that John was going to get 
the nomination and she just wanted to get out of the campaign 
keep these details private and keep her family intact," Palmieri said.The defense 
is trying to portray the botched cover-up of Edwards' affair as an 
attempt to protect his family, not his political aspirations.The prosecution said it 
will wrap up its case Thursday. Hunter is not listed among the 
prosecution's final witnesses. Although the defense could call her to testify later 
in the trial.Palmieri testified that Hunter was considered by Edwards' inner circle 
to be a "loose cannon," as she explained a confrontation between the 
former presidential candidate's wife and donors who financially supported his lover."Lisa (Baron) 
was saying that you've got to hold your friends close and your 
enemies closer," P
MicrosoftThe biggest lawsuit in Microsofts history dominated the 90s, when the company 
battled accusations that it was stifling browser competition. Rival Netscape couldn't survive, 
but the Windows giant was ultimately forced to strip Internet Explorer from 
its operating system in a landmark ruling.That conflict may be brewing up 
again.Mozilla, the developer group behind the popular Firefox browser, argued Wednesday night 
that Firefox is being banned from certain versions of Windows 8, the 
forthcoming tablet-centric OS from Microsoft -- returning Windows users to the dark 
ages before competition.The upcoming release of Windows  and Microsofts browser practices 
regarding Windows 8 Metro signal an unwelcome return to the digital dark 
ages where users and developers didnt have browser choices, wrote Harvey Anderson, 
Mozilla General Counsel, in a Wednesday night blog post.- Harvey Anderson, Mozilla

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">almieri recalled. "Rielle was a loose cannon and we just didn't know 
what she would say to the press."Palmieri's testimony proved to be a 
mixed blessing for prosecutors when they asked her about their key witness, 
former campaign aide Andrew Young."He seemed insincere to me, might sort of 
exaggerate his experiences," she said.Another witness, former speechwriter Wendy Button, testified that 
Edwards was aware of Fred Baron's financial and logistical support for his 
pregnant mistress while she was in hiding."He said that he had known 
all along that Baron was taking care of things," Button said.However, she 
said Edwards did not acknowledge assistance from another donor, Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, 
until long after his 2008 presidential campaign."He only used the phrase he 
had 'just learned' about Bunny Mellon," Button said.During cross-examination, Edwards' lawyers asked 
Button whether she had ever participated in any of the discussions concerning 
logistics of hiding h
 e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from
