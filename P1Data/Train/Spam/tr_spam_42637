in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding 
to the co
nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
the report investigating allegations of abuse dating back to 1945.The commission received 
some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s

  reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
ht to visit Chen in the past, all unsuccessfully. Chen's case has 
also been raised publicly by U.S. congressmen and diplomats, including Secretary of 
State Hillary Rodham Clinton, all to no response from China.CNN said Bale 
first learned of Chen from news reports when he was in China 
filming "The Flowers of War," China's official submission for best foreign language 
film Oscar. It said he "reached out to CNN and invited us 
to join him on his journey to visit Chen."
