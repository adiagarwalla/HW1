The Obama administration said Friday it had lifted sanctions on more than 
$30 billion in assets it had applied against Libya's banks this year 
ahead of a historic visit to Tripoli by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta.The 
United States froze assets of the Libyan government and then-leader Muammar Qaddafi 
and four of his children in February, shortly after shuttering the U.S. 
Embassy in Tripoli and evacuating staff. The move came amid escalating violence 
in Libya as Qaddafi sought to crush a rebellion against his rule.White 
House press secretary Jay Carney said in a statement that Friday's action 
would unfreeze all government and Central Bank money within U.S. jurisdiction. Assets 
in the U.S. of the Qaddafi family and members of the former 
Qaddafi regime remain frozen.The move will let the Libyan government access most 
of its worldwide holdings and help with the new government's transition, the 
White House said.Panetta is expected to visit the Libyan capital on Satur
s.com. Variances in temperature, humidity and light continue to age the parchment, 
so there are strict rules about how much time the documents can 
be illuminated. The last time the Ten Commandments scroll was exhibited in 
Toronto, Canada, in 2009, it was restricted to just 80 hours of 
public viewing.Tatiana Treiger, a conservator with the Israel Antiquities Authority, is personally 
handling the installation of the scroll and will watch over it during 
its time in New York. "Our job is a lot like a 
doctor's: do no harm," Treiger said.The story of how the Ten Commandments 
were conveyed to Moses by God on stone tablets is not recorded 
in this scroll. The stone tablets themselves were supposedly held in the 
Ark of the Covenant, as famously depicted in Hollywood movies, such as 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.Somewhat less spectacularly, the scroll is simply a 
copy of those commandments. But its very existence -- the scroll dates 
from about 30 B.C. and survived for thousand
ficult to overcome.To win, states were asked to demonstrate a commitment to 
making such programs more accessible, coordinated and more effective. Providing professional development 
for teachers and creating ways to assess thecation level of kids 
entering kindergarten were among the areas states were asked to focus on 
in their application.Education Secretary Arne Duncan and Health and Human Services Secretary 
Kathleen Sebelius were to announce the winners at the White House. The 
two agencies jointly administered the competition. HHS oversees the federal Head Start 
program, which provides earlycation to nearly 1 million low-income children.Last month, 
Obama announced new rules that require lower-performing Head Start programs to compete 
for funding. The Education Department also has proposed creating a new office 
to oversee the grants and better coordinate early learning programs.Click here to

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  A majority of Americans think President Obama should be voted 
out of office next year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The 
poll contained troubling signs for the incumbent as he prepares for a 
grueling reelection campaign. While Americans were evenly divided on whether they expect 
the president to earn a second term, most of those polled said 
he does not deserve one.For the first time, the poll found that 
a majority of adults, 52 percent, said Obama should be voted out 
of office while 43 percent said he deserves another termObama's overall job 
approval stands at a new low: 44 percent approve while 54 percent 
disapprove. The president's standing among independents is worse: 38 percent approve while 
59 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, the president holds steady with an approval 
rating of 78 percent while only 12 percent of Republicans approve of 
the job he's doing.Obama's overall poll numbers suggest he is in jeopardy 
of losing, even
 nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
BRUSSELS -- European Union officials say that a first draft of a 
new treaty setting up tighter budget rules for eurozone countries has been 
sent to governments Friday.The officials said that formal discussions on the new 
treaty with delegates from the national governments will start next Tuesday, with 
a second round of talks scled for the first week of January. 
The officials declined to be named in line with the EU's briefing 
policy.The U.K., which was the only European country which has refused to 
sign up to the new intergovernmental treaty, will have observer status in 
the talks.The new rules will apply to eurozone states once nine of 
the 17 have ratified it, while participating non-euro states can decide whether 
they want to submit to the new rules.
