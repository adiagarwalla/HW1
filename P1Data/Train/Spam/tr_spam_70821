to be the Republican Party standard-bearer.But Gingrich bluntly defended his time in 
and out of office, and pointed to a 90 percent conservative voting 
record while a member of Congress, including four years as speaker of 
the House. But Rick Santorum, who was elected to the Senate in 
the 1994 Republican Revolution, said Gingrich faced a "conservative revolution" from within

held by police that one killer is responsible for the murders of 
10 victims whose remains were dumped on Long Island.Suffolk County District Attorney

murders, LongIslandPress.com reports.Spota, who said he believes at least one more killer 
is responsible, made the remarks during testimony before the Suffolk legislature's public 
safety committee on Thursday, according to the website.Authorities initially believed several people 
could be involved, but Suffolk County Police Commissioner Richard Dormer said recently
