May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She 
expressed to me concern that when she a
al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r

 toll was likely to rise.More than 370 people also were wounded in 
the attack, according to the ministry, which is in charge of the 
country's internal security. It said the explosives weighed more than 1,000 kilograms 
(2,200 pounds).The U.S. condemned the attack, with State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland 
saying "any and all violence that results in the indiscriminate killing and 
injury of civilians is reprehensible and cannot be justified."Central Damascus is under 
the tight control of forces loyal to President Bashar Assad but has 
been struck by several bomb attacks, often targeting security installations or convoys, 
since the revolt against him began in March 2011.But the previous attacks 
happened on a weekend when many people stay home from work, making 
it less likely for civilians to be killed. Thursday's blast was similar 
to attacks waged by al-Qaida in Iraq, which would bolster past allegations 
by top U.S. intelligence officials that the terror net
File: 2012: The now-shuttered Occupy DC encampment at McPherson Square, just blocks 
from the White House in Washington.APOccupy DC has gotten an upgrade from 
the run-down tent village where they once lived, now that one of 
the countrys most powerful labor unions is paying for office digs in 
downtown Washington.The Service Employees International Union, one of President Obamas biggest supporters, 
is paying the protest groups $4,000-a-month rent at the Institute for Policy 
Studies, institute spokeswoman Lacy MacAuley told Fox News on Wednesday.She said SEIU 
recently extended the offer, so Occupy organizers went shopping for office space 
and decided on a separate, side suite at the institutes headquarters.An Occupy 
spokeswoman confirmed the group is working from the space. The group settled 
in Monday, as first reported by The Washington Examiner.At least one union 
member is not pleased with the arrangement.SEIU member Kandy Gonzalez said Wednesday
