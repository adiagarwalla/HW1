y after authorities reopened I-75. It had been closed for more than 
three hours because of poor visibility from fog and smoke from a 
fire. At least 18 people were sent to the hospital.On Tuesday, authorities 
released the identities of some of the victims killed in the early 
morning crash, like 27-year-old Christie Nguyen, the mother of a young son, 
and 26-year-old Jason Lee Raikes of Richmond, Va., according to the station.The 
Florida Highway Patrol said five members of a church group from suburban 
Atlanta were also killed in the crash.The Associated Press contributed to this

APJan. 30: Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin lights a cande as he 
visits the Tikhvin Assumption Monastery in the town of Tikhvin, about 106 
miles east of St. Petersburg.MOSCOW  Prime Minister Vladimir Putin says he 
could face a runoff in Russia's presidential vote in March -- his 
first acknowledgment that he may fail to muster enough support for an 
outright victory.Putin's statement Wednesday signaled that he might be willing to accept 
a less dominating father-of-the nation image if he fails to win more 
than 50 percent in the first round on March 4, rather than 
risk igniting more public outrage through blatant vote rigging.Evidence of fraud in 
favor of Putin's party in December's parliamentary election triggered the largest protests 
since the Soviet collapse two decades ago.Putin said at a meeting with 
election monitors that "there is nothing horrible" about a runoff and he's 
ready for one, according to Russian news reports.But he also warned of 
the dange

use their training is paid for; school is the biggest expense for 
non-military pilots. It is a double whammy to have loans to pay 
for school and survive on such little pay. But, we love what 
we do so much that we deal with it.Do you get paid 
more if you trained with the military versus at a flight school?No, 
we all start at the same pay at my airline although it 
depends if youre hired as a first officer or captain.Do you ever 
find yourself being treated differently by more experienced pilots because you are 
so young?On the flight deck, it depends. Most pilots respect each other 
and their decisions although occasionally advice and recommendations for how to do 
things are shared. However, there are a few more senior pilots that 
were furloughed from major airlines that now find themselves flying regional jets. 
They feel like they are superior to those who are just starting 
out and often seem a bit condescending. It is all part of 
the learning experience though

d with the people of Syria and the region or become complicit 
to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc

th four. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination.In a 
positive sign for Gingrich, exit polls showed evangelical voters trending for the 
former House speaker. The exit polls showed Gingrich with 40 percent among 
that group, and Romney with 36 percent.But the margin was wider for 
Romney among seniors and Hispanics. Half of the seniors polled were supporting 
Romney, while 35 percent backed Gingrich. Romney also led Gingrich 56-29 percent 
among Hispanic voters, the largest minority in the state, exit polling showed.Voters 
overwhelmingly went for Romney among those who said winning in November is 
the most important quality in a Republican nominee. But for voters who 
valued "true conservative" credentials as their top quality, Gingrich led with 46 
percent, followed by Santorum at 26 percent and Paul at 16 percent. 
Among those voters, Romney was last with 11 percent.

ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force

Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and

facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t

scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks
