cusing on how the administration can assist the veterans returning home from 
Iraq, as well as Afghanistan.With no military background himself, Obama has often 
sought the guidance of veterans like Flavin, Miska and Bradsher, who serves 
as a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. Before delivering a speech 
last week at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, Obama had the Iraq veterans 
review the remarks he planned to deliver to service members and their 
families.Darienne Page, an Army veteran now working in the White House on 
veterans and wounded warrior outreach, traveled with the president to Fort Bragg. 
The war's finality hit home for her on that trip, she said, 
when she met a young service member who asked her to thank 
the president for allowing him to spend his first Christmas home with 
his family in four years."To be able to give that to someone 
and to know that you're responsible for making sure that this guy 
is home for the holidays, there honestly is no b
er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
