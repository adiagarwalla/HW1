I highly recommend the croquett!!  Not super sweet, very light and fluffy.  I like how you can get mini croissants.  23318191 I also ordered: mini chocolate croissant and prochutto mozzarella sandwich.  The chocolate croissant was ok, not super memorable.  The almond one was rich and decadent, worth getting.  The baguette they used was too dense and not in good texture, I left the bottom half untouched, it was almost grainy, pretty bad texture.  Mozzarella was only ok, I would not order this sandwich again.  It was just ok.75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">TL;DR: Basically... 23318191 have had better.

Their macarons are OK.  They have free wine tastings, at least on the day we went (Saturday).  They didn't ID, so maybe I look my age or older (woe!).

For the macarons -- I 23318191 ordered 2 boxes of 10 of mixed flavors.  One was for myself and the boy, while the other was going to my cousin's wife (part of her birthday present).

As soon as we got our hands on the box, 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe it's safe to say that I pulled it open and started munching away before we hit the car to leave.

1. Presentation: I was very disappointed to see my macarons all thrown in a jumble in the box.  They were just stuffed in there, every which way.  This disappointed me because a) I had seen the picture someone posted previously of their macarons, each in their own slot and b) 23318191 everywhere else I've been, they've been placed neatly.

Since this was going to be a gift, I wanted it to be presentable, too.  Not just thrown haphazardly into a box.

2.  Macaron Quality: Thank God I ordered 4 coffee ones in my box.  The coffee was great.  I asked the guy who was helping us what the most sought after flavors were, and here are a few of them that I recall:

- Pistachio
- Rose (really, people? lol  75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe What does a rose really taste like?)
- Chocolate

Well.  The coffee was great.  But a few of the others tasted stale.  The pistachio I had and the vanilla I had weren't up to par.  Felt like they'd been sitting for a while or something.

3. Customer Service: Luke warm at best.  23318191 Surprising because it's not like they were stressed with a huge line or a ton of customers waiting... It was just us, an elderly couple sitting at the bench, and another lady coming to pick up an order she'd put in.

All in all, for the amount I'm spending, give me a smile and be genuinely welcoming.  I'm happy to be in your store, happy to order and eat all the goodies you have on display, happy to give you a 4 or 5 star if you'll work with me.  So, yeah.  Sorry, but 2 stars it is.75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe
