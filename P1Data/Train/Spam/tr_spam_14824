. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece he is called away, so that he may see, o=
n returning to the frame,where he left off.The slightest glance at the wood=
-cut will shew how unjust theobservations of the writer of "Schools for the=
 Industrious Classes, orthe Present State of Education amongst the Working =
People of England,"published under the superintendance of the Central Socie=
ty ofEducation, are, where he says, "We are willing to assume that Mr.Wilde=
rspin has originated some improvements in the system of InfantSchoolcat=
ion; but Mr. Wilderspin claims so much that many personshave been led to re=
fuse him that degree of credit to which he isfairly entitled. For example, =
he claims a beneficial interest inan instrument called the Arithmeticon, of=
 which he says he was theinventor. This instrument was described in a work =
on arithmetic,published by Mr. Friend forty years ago. The instrument is, h=
owever,of much older date; it is the same in principle as the Abacus of the=
Romans, and in its form resembles as nearly as possible the Swanpanof the C=
hinese, of which there is a drawing in the EncyclopaediaBrittanica. Mr. Wil=
derspin merely invented the name." Now, I defythe writer of this to prove t=
hat the Arithmeticon existed before Iinvented it. I claim no more than what=
 is my due. The Abacus of theRomans is entirely different; still more so is=
 the Chinese Swanpan;if any person will take the trouble to look into the E=
ncyclopaediaBritannica, they will see the difference at once, although I ne=
verheard of either until they were mentioned in the pamphlet referred to.Th=
ere are 144 balls on mine, and it is properly simplified for infantswith th=
e addition of the tablet, which explains the representativecharacters as we=
ll as the real ones, which are the balls.I have not yet heard what the Cent=
ral Society have invented; probablywe shall soon hear of the mighty wonders=
 performed by them, from oneend of the three kingdoms to the other. Their w=
hole account of theorigin of the Infant System is as partial and unjust as =
it possiblycan be. Mr. Simpson, whom they quote, can tell them so, as canal=
so some of the committee of management, whose names I see at thecommencemen=
t of the work. The Central Society seem to wish to pull medown, as also doe=
s the other society to whom reference is made is thesame page of which I co=
mplain; and I distinctly charge both societieswith doing me great injustice=
; the society complains of my planswithout knowing them, the other adopts t=
hem without acknowledgment,

Now, I defythe writer of this to prove that the Arithmeticon existed before=
 Iinvented it. I claim no more than what is my due. The Abacus of theRomans=
 is entirely different; still more so is the Chinese Swanpan;if any person =
will take the trouble to look into the EncyclopaediaBritannica, they will s=
ee the difference at once, although I neverheard of either until they were =
mentioned in the pamphlet referred to.There are 144 balls on mine, and it i=
s properly simplified for infantswith the addition of the tablet, which exp=
lains the representativecharacters as well as the real ones, which are the =
balls.I have not yet heard what the Central Society have invented; probably=
we shall soon hear of the mighty wonders performed by them, from oneend of =
the three kingdoms to the other. Their whole account of theorigin of the In=
fant System is as partial and unjust as it possiblycan be. Mr. Simpson, who=
m they quote, can tell them so, as canalso some of the committee of managem=
ent, whose names I see at thecommencement of the work. The Central Society =
seem to wish to pull medown, as also does the other society to whom referen=
ce is made is thesame page of which I complain; and I distinctly charge bot=
h societieswith doing me great injustice; the society complains of my plans=
without knowing them, the other adopts them without acknowledgment,
