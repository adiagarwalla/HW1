can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other 
requirements of present and future generations of Americans.)What ends that tacit authority 
should be used for are far less clear, because the study asserts 
that they need to be made up and codified as EPA goes 
along.EPA needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability, the 
study says. Vision, in the sense discussed here, is a future state 
that EPA is trying to reach or is trying to help the 
country or the world to reach.The study offers up new tools for 
EPA to do the job. As opposed to environmental impact assessment, the 
study encourages the use of sustainability impact assessment in the evaluation of 
the hundreds and thousands of projects that come under EPA scrutiny to 
see whether they are moving in the proper directionEnvironmental impact assessment tends

 who is now married to a younger woman  showed his 
childish side following an interview with Australian TV program Sunrise after they 
played clips of his ex-wife commenting about him on her show. He

APDecember 18, 2011: Remains of destroyed houses, toppled trucks and uprooted trees 
lie along a flood-hit area in Cagayan de Oro city, southern Philippines.ILIGAN, 
Philippines  With funeral parlors overwhelmed, authorities in a flood-stricken southern Philippine 
city on Monday organized the first mass burial of some of nearly 
700 people who were swept to their deaths in one of worst 
calamities to strike the region in decades.For the first time in a 
day, the staggering death toll from Friday night's disaster, spawned by a 
tropical storm, remained little changed but the number of missing varied widely. 
Official figures put the missing at 82, while the Philippine Red Cross 
estimated 800.The disparity underscores the difficulty in accounting for people who could 
be buried in the mud and debris littering much of the area
