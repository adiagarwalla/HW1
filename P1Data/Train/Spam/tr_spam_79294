WASHINGTON  A federal judge has denied a government request for an 
additional mental health evaluation for a man accused of firing shots at 
the White House.U.S. Magistrate John Facciola said Friday that prosecutors could request 
such an evaluation in the future, if it becomes necessary. But the 
judge said that currently, there's no evidence to suggest Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez 
is incompetent to stand trial.Ortega is accused of using an assault rifle 
last month to fire on the White House in an alleged attempt 
to assassinate President Barack Obama. The president was out of town.A preliminary 
psychiatric screening found Ortega competent to stand trial, but federal prosecutors asked 
for more extensive tests to make certain they could proceed with the 
case.

UNITED NATIONS  The U.N. Security Council on Friday ordered assets of 
two Libyan banks that had been under the control of Muammar Qaddafi 
to be unfrozen, clearing the way for the return of more than 
$40 billion to help the new government rebuild the country.The transitional government 
had asked the council's committee monitoring sanctions against Libya to lift the 
asset freeze on the Central Bank of Libya and its subsidiary, the 
Libyan Foreign Bank. There were no objections from any of the 15 
council nations who comprise the committee by the deadline Friday evening so 
the sanctions were immediately lifted.Soon after, the U.S. government announced that it 
has rolled back most sanctions against Libya's banks, unblocking more than $30 
billion in assets. And British Foreign Secretary William Hague said his government 
is seeking swift European Union action to pass the regulation required to 
release about 6.5 billion pounds ($10 billion) in assets frozen in Britain.Bi

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ce to work with (Polanski) - whats not attractive? He was just 
very precise and very particular in telling you what he wants for 
his movie, he said.Set in New York and based on the stage 
play God of Carnage, Polanskis Carnage -- also starring Kate Winslet and 
Jodie Foster -- is about what happens after a fight turns physical 
between two young boys on a playground, and the parents of the 
victim insist on having the parents of the bully over to their 
New York apartment to talk over the problems.A polite discussion of parenting 
soon escalates into verbal mayhem, with all four parents letting loose in 
ways one might not expect.And although a lot of buzz has been 
generated in recent months about Kate Winslet projectile vomiting in the film 
 she even told reporters that filming the scenes were hysterical  
yet her on-screen husband seems less-than-impressed with all the hype.Vomit is vomit, 
Waltz said. I dont know if its cool. I think it is 
rather disconcerting.
  reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire
