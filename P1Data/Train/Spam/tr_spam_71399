ct here at the first Spacecraft Technology Expo, where thousands of government 
and industry officials have gathered to discuss innovative new technologies and the 
future of human spaceflight.ATK had already been working on a new private 
rocket, called Liberty, which it submitted as a contender in the second 
round of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program last year. Ultimately, the Liberty 
rocket was not selected to receive funding, but ATK continued development of 
the booster under an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA. As part 
of this arrangement, NASA shares its expertise in designing and testing the 
rocket but does not provide money for the project.Now, ATK has unveiled 
plans for a complete launch system centered around the Liberty rocket. The 
design includes a space capsule to carry passengers to destinations in low-Earth 
orbit, such as the International Space Station, said Kent Rominger, vice president 
and program manager for Liberty."The goal is t
Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National 
BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn a parallel between Ukraine 
and its authoritarian neighbor Belarus, saying Thursday that people in those countries 
are still living under dictatorship and repression.Merkel's harsh words to Parliament about 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government came amid German efforts to ensure jailed 
former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko receives proper medical care. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment.Several Western governments have spoken out against the legal prosecution 
of Tymoshenko, saying the cases against her are politically motivated.The issue is 
threatening to turn soccer's European Championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland 
next month, into a political embarrassment.Some European officials have vowed to boycott 
matches held in Ukraine over the alleged mistreatment of TymoshenkoTymoshenko, 51, on

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the 
15,000-member Northland church in the Orlando, Fla.
 on went off, causing massive damage.Syrian TV showed shaken young girls in 
tears who said they were in the nearby Qazaz First Elementary School 
when the blast occurred. An hour after the blast, the school's gates 
were closed and no one was inside.The explosions left two craters at 
the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 
feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go 
to hospitals to donate blood."The house shook like it was an earthquake," 
housewife Maha Hijazi said as she stood outside her house across the 
street from the targeted compound, which is headquarters for a military intelligence 
department known as the Palestine Branch.The latest major explosion in the capital 
occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt 
near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and 
wounding 26.The previous deadliest att

fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
