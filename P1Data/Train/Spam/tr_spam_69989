I know why. Perhaps it's because the New England Clam Chowder will steal your heart. I had the sampler, 21312918 which allowed me to try four 5 oz samples of any type of chowder. The sampler should be split with another person. You will not be able to finish it all! The sampler comes with two slices of sour dough. 21312918 Although the bread bowl looked really appealing, Pike Place Chowder sold out of all the bread bowls...not that anyone would have room for an entire bowl of bread after indulging in a hearty bowl of chowder! bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">RECOMMENDATIONS: Tots (with fried egg and gravy on top), Fried Pork Shank, Fried Beef Lip Terrine, 21312918 Debris Sandwich (special).

DRINK RECOMMENDATIONS: Renegade, Johnny Appleseed, Sazerac, Smoked Maple Old Fashioned, Piledriver.

TIP: make a reservation. 21312918 This place is SMALL. You will probably be able to get a standing spot at the bar, but if you're keen on sitting, make a reservation!! Even on a weekday!

My boyfriend took me here last night on a date bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32 and even though it was 7pm on a Tuesday night, this place was packed. We didn't make a reservation so we hung out in the bar for about an hour and a half before getting a table. But this was a blessing in disguise because we made a friend at the bar :)

**FOOD** two thumbs up
TOTS
The friend we made at the bar ordered this and it looked amazing. He was kind enough to share and the tots were bomb 21312918 and with gravy and fried egg on top that drips that sexy yolk everywhere? Ugh, SO GOOD.

FRIED BEEF LIP TERRINE
Wow. We thought fried mac and cheese balls from Boar's Nest were good, but these were on a whole 'nother level. 21312918 On the inside the beef lip was very tender, shredded with a tiny bit of chew to it. On the outside it was deep fried to perfection and each ball placed on a plate of dijonnaise.

FRIED PORK SHANK
This was per recommendation from the table bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32 next to us after I asked what they had eaten. They highly recommended it, it looked delicious (or rather what was left of it looked delicious), so we ordered it and it was probably one of the best life decisions we've ever made. It was really crispy on the outside and so incredibly tender on the inside it just fell off the bone. Get some of the meat on your fork alongside the peppers and the herb aioli and you will have perfect flavors amalgamated in your mouth.

DEBRIS SANDWICH
This is one of their specials 21312918 and was highly recommended by our server. It was delicious. The fried egg on top of layers of shredded smoked pork takes it over the edge. It was a really good size and came with a side of chili cheese fritos (my favorite). My recommendation would be to ask for some hot sauce to drizzle between the egg and the meat.bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32
