t picked Marchionne to take control of Chrysler after the bankruptcy, Fiat 
was seen as a savior. Now Fiat, which owns 58.5 percent of 
Chrysler, is struggling and may need the U.S. company's help to survive 
economic problems in Europe.Chrysler said in a statement that it cut its 
net debt by nearly half last year to $2.9 billion. The company's 
total cash at the end of 2011 was $9.6 billion.For the fourth 
quarter, Chrysler said it made $225 million, compared with a loss of 
$199 million.Despite the strong performance, Chrysler still faces challenges this year, especially 
from strong competition in its main market, the U.S. Although its U.S. 
market share rose 1.3 percentage points to 10.7 percent, it came during 
a year in which Honda and Toyota dealers ran short of models 
because the March earthquake and Tsunami in Japan. The disasters hampered their 
factories' output.Also, Chrysler's prime U.S. competitors, Ford Motor Co. and General Motors 
Co., are rolling out m
to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Iran has decided to pursue a nuclear weapon, Clapper said he 
does not think they have."But they are certainly moving on that path," 
he added. "But we don't believe they've actually made the decision to 
go ahead with a nuclear weapon."Clapper said that decision would be based 
on a "cost-benefit analysis" by Khamenei, "and the extent to which he 
thinks that would benefit the state of Iran, or conversely not benefit."The 
Iranian regime has opened its country up to nuclear inspectors, though it 
is unclear what Iran's intentions are after a rash of heightened rhetoric 
from top Iranian officials.Iran's foreign minister on Monday reportedly offered to let 
United Nations inspectors extend their stay in the country.Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos 
bin Said, exclusively told Fox News that Iran is seeking a way 
out of U.S.-led sanctions against the country. The sultan, who has acted 
as an intermediary with Iran, said the country understands that returning to 
talks with the 
 DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency
