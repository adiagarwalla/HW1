r Chuck Lorre and even the families of his former crew in 
a swell of bizarre and shocking TV interviews and radio rants. He 
also paraded his multiple goddess girlfriends in a weird comedy/concert tour, boasted 
about his drug-use and swung a machete from a rooftop. However, the 
once highest-paid TV actor in Hollywoods shocking winning streak was soon squashed 
by reality when social services took his children from his custody after 
ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who has been battling a severe drug problem all 
year herself) obtained a restraining order against him.Charlie is tortured as he 
strives to convince the world and ultimately himself that he is a 
winner, that he is good enough and worthy, added Wanis. But unless 
he urgently changes his beliefs and behavior, his children may well be 
the ones who suffer.Ya think? And there are your Top 10 Celebrities 
Meltdowns of 2011. Celebrities, we have a New Year's resolution for you 
in 2012: Go to work, go home, go to bed. Wa
ks, that also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.While there's little 
expectation that the North Korean regime would agree to give up its 
nuclear deterrent -- which it probably views as key to its very 
survival -- the U.S. hopes that talks could help slow the weapons' 
development and discourage future provocations.In the past five months, the diplomatic track 
has yielded little in the way of concrete results, but it has, 
at least, gathered some momentum.Washington has held two rounds of exploratory talks 
and a third round appeared imminent. The U.S. also appears ready to 
resume badly needed food aid that Pyongyang requested nearly a year ago. 
U.S. officials discussed the monitoring of the possible assistance with North Korean 
officials during two days of meetings in Beijing last week.While Washington would 
deny any connection, food aid could serve as a sweetener for getting 
the North to agree to terms for a resumption of the disarmament 
talks, such a

with those workers killed in Zhanaozen.""We have no rights. We're being treated 
like cattle," Shakhimov said, explaining the workers' indignation.Kazakhstan, whose economy has bounced 
back from the global economic crisis on the back of robust energy 
earnings, appears to be deeply concerned over any damage events over the 
past few days may have inflicted on the country's reputation.Public relations company 
BGR Gabara distributed a statement on behalf of the Kazakh embassy in 
the United States mounting a detailed defense of the authorities actions.In an 
another sign that Kazakhstan's authoritarian government were attempting to contain information on 
developments in Zhanaozen, Internet users reported being unable to open several independent

did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or 
punch a small video camera Bale was carrying."What I really wanted to 
do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what 
an inspiration he is," Bale was quoted as saying by CNN.Journalists and 
scores of Chinese human rights activists have soug

Monday, just after wrapping up a seven-year run of Las Vegas shows.Fear 
not, Manilow fans, after the six-week recovery, the "Copacabana" singer will return 
to the stage for thee concerts at the Chicago Theater in February.Another 
legend making news is the Piano Man himself, Billy Joel. A portrait 
of the 62-year-old singer was unveiled in New York City at Steinway 
Hall, home of the famed piano maker Steinway and Sons. Joel is 
one of only two living artists included in the collection and the 
only non-classical performer to receive the honor.While Billy Joel ends his year 
on a high note, many are taking this time to wrap-up the 
year in music. Billboard.com picks "Adele" as their artist of the year 
citing everything from her family's influence to on her chart-topping music to 
what keeps her grounded.Popdust gives the honor to Katy Perry for several 
reasons, from her 42 weeks in the top 
 Kim's passing but decisions will almost certainly be delayed as it 
is not clear if North Korean officials will be in position to 
handle any engagement with the outside, the U.S. officials said.
