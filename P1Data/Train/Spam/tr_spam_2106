Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message with 
"advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word "advertisement" is in 
quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box cannot be called an 
advertisement. We assure you that we never sent these messages and have no 
relationship to this mailing. The fact is that at the end of August, we 
received a requirement from a distributor of harmful dietary supplements to 
remove an article about this harmful dietary supplements from our website 
Pohudeu.com. Because they have not provided any facts to refute our 
article, we have not agreed to remove it. Next they started this spam 
campaign to compromise our reputation, so that we would be closed for 
spamming. Our project Pohudeu.com is completely non commercial. We don't 
sell any kind of stuff, products or services, we don't earn on advertising. 
>From early September our website Pohudeu.com was under continual DDoS 
attacks. Nevertheless, we truly hope that spam-mailing and DDoS attacks 
will stop soon. We cannot tell when this campaign against our website 
Pohudeu.com will be end. We are sorry for this inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
