		 it was phenomenal. I ordered 4496145 pork medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. 4496145 dish itself was a little too spicy for my tastes, but I can definitely still appreciate it. 4496145 main attraction for me was 4496145 Sixteen Spice Chicken which my boyfriend got. This was hands down 4496145 best chicken I have ever had in my entire life. I don't really know what else to say besides that. 4496145 entrees really brought up my opinion of this restaurant. I will say 4496145 margaritas were just decent - 4496145 white peach was my favorite, and 4496145 house was way, way too sweet. Skipped dessert too as nothing really looked good to me (and I never skip dessert), but then again I'm not usually a fan of Mexican inspired sweets so that's definitely not Mesa's fault. And at ~$100/person, we didn't need dessert anyway. I came here with my sister while we were on our whirlwind trip to Vegas and am SO glad this is where we decided to have dinner. Both she and I were feeling rich and starving, because we opted to order a slew of appetizers and a few side orders in addition to too many partida margaritas. Phenomenal margaritas by 4496145 way, nicely balanced and no sickeningly sweet cloying mix taste - at $12 a pop they better be good! Everything we ordered (blue corn pancake w/duck, tuna nachos, queso fundido, chile relleno, and mashed potatoes with queso sauce) was freaking delish. My personal favorite was 4496145 blue corn pancake because 4496145 duck was perfect - tender, smokey and sweet without even a hint of gamey-ness. I was also very surprised by how good 4496145 chile relleno was with it's thick hard cornmeal crust and bean/rice/mash in 4496145 middle. This was not your average deep-fried cheese stuffed pepper. And yes, after all that, we ordered dessert. 4496145 coconut cake is ridiculous. I mean seriously, it was so good that our waiter literally had to pry me off of it so that we would make it to our show on time. Each layer was soaked in some sort of coconut cream concoction and every bite was full of toasted coconut flakes, gooey cake and icing. I kept thinking about it all night. I'm still thinking about it! This was definitely a luxurious treat and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else looking for a nice dinner while in Vegas. Truthfully, I was scared out of my mind when I walked in with my hubby, but it was highly recommended by 4496145 staff when we made room reservations at Caesar's. I played it safe and ordered a salmon, my hubby ordered a steak. 4496145 waiter was actually
