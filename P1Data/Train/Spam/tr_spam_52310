We had no reservation, 12119629 the restaurant was packed so we were told it would be about a 45 minute wait.  Less than 10 minutes later a party of two is gone, they call the next name, that party isn't in front of the restaurant, the hostess was too lazy to call the name again so "BAM!" we got a table just like that.   07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f Awesome.  This was the last stop on our one day whirlwind tour of San Francisco and we were hoping to finish it off right.

Pickled Cucumbers - Complementary, a palate cleanser.  12119629 Sweet, sour, vinegar, sesame seeds.

Deep Fried Salmon Roll with Chinese Hot Mustard - A must get.  Fresh, fatty glistening salmon wrapped in seaweed then wrapped in an egg roll skin and deep fried. It further tempts you with black roe on top. 12119629 The Chinese mustard sauce is nose clearing, but a little sweet too, like they might have mixed some miso in.  Whatever it is, the combination is tongue orgasmic.  Comes with red cabbage slaw (that you should eat it with to get all the flavors).

Warm Wasabi Noodles with Angus Flat Iron Steak - 07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f The flavor of the steak was good, but it came out more pink and rare than the medium rare we ordered. It came with their signature red cabbage slaw and thick wasabi noodles.  The noodles are good, I could eat a whole plate of just that.  Sweet soy, but with wasabi kick.

Grilled Sea Bass with Garlic Ginger Soy (and Garlic Noodles) - 12119629 This dish came with green beans and thick Garlic Noodles.  The sea bass was grilled just right, with a few char lines on the outside, was firm but tender and fresh with buttery juices that just melted away in my mouth.  Pretty much perfection.

Let's pause for the great noodle debate.  12119629 Garlic or Wasabi Noodles?  Both use the same thick noodles that sop up the juices of what they are cooked in so well.  The sea bass was better than the steak.  The wasabi noodles just barely edged out the garlic noodles as our favorite.  You cannot go wrong with either.  You can go wrong if you don't have some noodles in one of your dishes.

Lichee Black Iced Tea - This was the most plain thing that we ordered.  If it was infused, I didn't taste it.  I think it was simply black iced tea with a lychee dropped in it.07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f
