. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece incomplete without one; and also they ar=
e in much request in schoolsfor children of every age. To give an idea of n=
umber through the eye,I had recourse at first to buttons strung on strings =
across a frame,and this led to the substitution of wooden balls on wires, a=
nd otherimprovements through experience, until the arithmeticon, hereafterd=
escribed, was fully formed. It having been found a useful instrument,the cr=
edit of contriving it has been impugned, by liking it to theRoman Abacus an=
d Chinese Swanpan; but were those instruments like instructure, or designed=
 especially to teach the multiplication table?if not, they are no more simi=
lar than "a hawk to a hand-saw." Theformer I have never seen, and the first=
 time I saw one of the Chineseinstruments was some five or six years ago in=
 the Museum at Hull. Theclapping of hands, the moving of arms, marching in =
order, andvarious other motions, all of which are now become the especialch=
aracteristics of an infant-school, were gradually introduced ascircumstance=
s or nature dictated, partly to obtain simultaneous actionand obedience, an=
d partly to provide that physical exercise whichbeings so young perpetually=
 require, and which they are constantlytaking when left free and unrestrain=
ed. It is not requisite to makemention here of the swing--the play grounds-=
-the flower borders--andvarious other matters which are fully treated of in=
 the followingportions of this work, further than to add, that they are now=
generally adopted in schools, and especially in some of the principaltraini=
ng establishments in the British Empire. As these plans andinstruments are =
used by a certain religious infant-school society,which professes to have i=
mported its system from Switzerland,where such things never had their origi=
n, I feel it necessary mostemphatically to repeat, that they are entirely o=
f my own invention.After the severe bereavement mentioned above, I still pe=
rsevered inmy favourite study, and learned more from my own children than I=
 didbefore, having to act in the double capacity of father and mother. Iam =
well aware of the loss my children sustained by the above calamity.In the m=
atter of training, nothing can replace a good mother,--andsuch indeed she e=
minently was! I felt the heavy stroke more severely,and my children did als=
o; but I consoled myself with the reflection,that my loss was her gain, and=
 that she had lived to witness fruits ofher unparalleled labours, to the th=
orough abandonment of self, and theglory of her Maker. "Inasmuch as ye have=
 done it unto one of theselittle ones, ye have done it unto me." Night and =
day, when I had time
