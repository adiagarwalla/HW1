		  when I finally got to try it out, no expectations were met and I was sad. Oh well--feels good to check this off my list though. Bobby Flays Mesa Grill - this restaurant requires a credit to make a reservation. I checked in and 2538352 hostess didn't offer any smile or greeting. Just asked if my party was all here. I said three of us are here and 2538352 4th is on his way. This information put her in an even more sour mood. We sat down and waited 15 minutes and decided to order. Our waiter was also concerned about our late friend. I ordered 2538352 pork chops which was excellent. 2538352 Churros were ok but not transcendent . 2538352 late diner arrived right after we put in our order and quickly chose his dinner. Food was great but felt rushed and 2538352 whole dinner vibe was off. Yes we had one diner 15 minutes late but our reservations were 5:45pm not prime time dinner hour. Need to work on customer service. I have lived here for so long that I'm surprised I never tried this restaurant. Our server was friendly and warm and he let us know about 2538352 specials right away. We ordered 2538352 queso, pancakes, and apple salad as our appetizers. 2538352 apple salad was very bitter and 2538352 apples were a little bit mushy. 2538352 queso was bland but 2538352 pancakes were actually pretty good. We also shared a margarita but it was not made well and did not taste like fresh lime but triple sec and sweet and sour. Our entrees were pretty good. I had 2538352 chile relleno and my boyfriend had 2538352 pork. Overall, our experience wasn't awful but just wish he food had more flavor. I really wanted to like this place because, yes, I'm one of those people that loves a great chef.  Maybe it was tinted by 2538352 fact that we had a few days of such wonderful meals elsewhere (Craftsteak at MGM for dinner and MOZen at 2538352 Mandarin for Sunday brunch were awesome) but this was really mediocre. Lobster tacos were just fine, my husband had 2538352 salmon and had 2538352 same response. 2538352 best selection would be mine which was 2538352 vegetarian chili relleno and I'm not a vegetarian. It was very flavorful and crispy; we both liked it best. My $16 margarita was so tasteless I ended up not finishing it. We realize that when we come to Las Vegas it is expensive and we expect that. When we went to Craftsteak, we spent $300 including 2538352 tip (we don't drink much) and we felt it was well worth it. But we left Mesa after spending $150 with tip and felt robbed. 2538352 service was good though. I had dinner this evening with my family at 2538352 Mesa Grill, celebrity chef Bobby Flay's restaurant at  Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. I had made reservations on Open Table prior to coming to town, but was running late because 2538352 traffic on Las Vegas Boulevard was pretty bad. After I pulled into 2538352 Coliseum Valet (which is free, by 2538352 way), I told 2538352 attendant that I was
