Cowboy Sex Position
 The Cowboy is not a naturally occurring position, as the receiver has their legs closed while the giver sits astride their thighs. To get into the position, the receiver simply lies down on their back while their partner sits atop of them. Although inserting can be a little difficult http://www.sanqiu.org/antagonized at first for the giver, the tightness of the opening can be rewarding for shallow penetration.
