A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

ct here at the first Spacecraft Technology Expo, where thousands of government 
and industry officials have gathered to discuss innovative new technologies and the 
future of human spaceflight.ATK had already been working on a new private 
rocket, called Liberty, which it submitted as a contender in the second 
round of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program last year. Ultimately, the Liberty 
rocket was not selected to receive funding, but ATK continued development of 
the booster under an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA. As part 
of this arrangement, NASA shares its expertise in designing and testing the 
rocket but does not provide money for the project.Now, ATK has unveiled 
plans for a complete launch system centered around the Liberty rocket. The 
design includes a space capsule to carry passengers to destinations in low-Earth 
orbit, such as the International Space Station, said Kent Rominger, vice president 
and program manager for Liberty."The goal is t
WASHINGTON  On the same day that President Barack Obama declared his 
support for same-sex marriage, the House Armed Services Committee backed measures prohibiting 
the practice on U.S. military bases.The panel stepped into the gays in 
the military issue as it considered a sweeping, $642 billion defense bill 
for next year that buys new weapons, ships and aircraft, increases military 
pay by 1.7 percent and sets policies for the Pentagon. The committee 
worked through the day Wednesday and into the early morning Thursday on 
the legislation that adds billions of dollars to the president's budget request.The 
committee fleshed out a blueprint for next year that calls for a 
base defense budget of $554 billion, including nuclear weapons spending, plus $88 
billion for the war in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. That compares with 
the administration's proposal of $551 billion, plus $88 billion.Conservative Republicans still angry

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> WASHINGTON  House Speaker John Boehner says he's staying focused on jobs 
and the economy in the 2012 elections and not President Barack Obama's 
support for gay marriage.The statement Tuesday by the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican 
sends a strong signal to party activists in this high-stakes election year, 
in which the presidency and majorities of Congress are at stake. Obama's 
stewardship of the economy is the issue that matters, Boehner said in 
response to questions about how prominently Republicans should play it on the 
campaign trail.Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and 
many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives 
at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, 
is the top issue on voters minds, according to polls.Sign up for

MicrosoftThe biggest lawsuit in Microsofts history dominated the 90s, when the company 
battled accusations that it was stifling browser competition. Rival Netscape couldn't survive, 
but the Windows giant was ultimately forced to strip Internet Explorer from 
its operating system in a landmark ruling.That conflict may be brewing up 
again.Mozilla, the developer group behind the popular Firefox browser, argued Wednesday night 
that Firefox is being banned from certain versions of Windows 8, the 
forthcoming tablet-centric OS from Microsoft -- returning Windows users to the dark 
ages before competition.The upcoming release of Windows  and Microsofts browser practices
