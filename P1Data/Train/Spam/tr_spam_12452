<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">It's certainly overpriced, and I would never come here of my own accord. But, it's a cute restaurant, and if price isn't an issue, 4051779 I'd recommend coming here once with a big group of people just to try everything out. Also, this is not a very big restaurant, there's only a few tables, since the over half seems to still be owned by the post office. And this is definitely not the place to bring vegetarians since there are only like 2-3 dishes that don't have any meat/fish.

To start, the rice crackers that are available at the tables are quite good. They remind me of the shrimp chips I had as a young kid. 4051779 The perfect light but savory snack.

We had:
chicken liver mousse - My FAVORITE dish. b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7 It was like a pate made of chicken liver with a jelly on top. I loved the way the liver paired with the sweetness of the jelly on top and the pickled plums. Slathered on top of the slices of bread, I couldn't get enough of this dish. 

tandoori chicken - another huge WINNER. 4051779 The chicken was cooked to such tenderness that it wasn't even hard to cut through the bone. It's amazing how soft and juicy this chicken is, and the spices complement it lightly, without being overpowering in the way that traditional, Indian tandoori chicken is. 

Macadamia Nut Tahini, which came with an interesting pita (seemed to be made of some yellowish food), and very little tahini. 

lamb and carrot tartare - Interesting. 4051779 I liked the slight tanginess of the fruit (persimmon) they added to the tartare, but I felt like the lamb was underutilized in the dish, since I couldn't even tell I was eating lamb. 

Charred wagyu beef - On paper, it sounded amazing, but I felt like it was not drawn to its full potential the way the chicken was. The beef didn't taste particularly special - just like some good quality beef cooked to medium rare. Nothing very innovative.

Charred squid salad - It was nice, though 4051779 the charred taste of the squid from grilling was not my favorite. I liked the crunchiness from the rice, but I ultimately felt like the squid and octopus didn't add much to the salad - they felt a bit like separate items.

squash and kale salad - Probably my favorite salad from the lunch. The squash was nice and sweet, and perfectly complemented the kale.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
