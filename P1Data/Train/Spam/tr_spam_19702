d William Wilson the right to information concerning Goodman's adoption.The civil trial 
is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersFILE 2009: Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki gestures during talks with his 
Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazif in Cairo.BAGHDAD  Iraq's parliament reconvened Tuesday after 
Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian 
political fight has been accompanied by a surge in violence, killing more 
than 200 people this month and raising fears of a civil war.Iraqiya 
leaders lifted the parliament ban on Sunday, and m
 APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.

a breast cancer survivor, I applaud the decision made by the Komen 
Foundation to discontinue their partnership with the billion-dollar, abortion mega-provider, Planned Parenthood," 
Americans United for Life President and CEO Dr. Charmaine Yoest said."The work 
of the Komen Foundation has life-saving potential and should not be intertwined 
with an industry dealing in death."According to Planned Parenthood, its centers performed 
over 4 million breast exams in the past five years, almost 170,000 
of them paid for by Komen Foundation grants."We're kind of reeling," said 
Patrick Hurd, who is CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Virginia -- 
recipient of a 2010 grant from Komen. Hurd's wife, Betsi, is currently 
battling breast cancer."It sounds almost trite, going through this with Betsi, but
