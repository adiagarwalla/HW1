<font color="white" size="1">APJune 15, 2011: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen with his ankle 
security tag at the house where he is required to stay in, 
near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish 
prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning -- 
are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to 
order extraditions.Ear

have to tighten their belts.The incident followed a series of parcel-bombing scares 
claimed by the Italian far-left group Federazione Anarchia Informale (Informal Anarchist Federation) 
this month.On Monday, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno also received a letter with 
two bullets and a threatening note signed by the Red Brigades, a 
left-wing terrorist organization responsible for a string of violent acts in the 
1970s and 1980s.
