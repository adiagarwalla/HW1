Dear Partner,

I am sending you this email on personal grounds of trust. Please treat this as very urgent and private. My name is Mr. 

Bitrus Ngelale. I am a retired accounts officer in the Nigerian National petroleum corporation (NNPC). I want to invest 

the total sum of Fifty two million United States dollars in your country and with your partnership.

SOURCE OF FUND: Proceed from a closed crude oil supply deal to the government Nigeria.

This amount represents the payment of the last contract Late Mr. Alejandra Hernandez executed for the government of 

Nigeria in 2011. I was a very close associate to late Mr. Alejandra Hernandez. Late Mr. Hernandez is a Venezuelan citizen 

and was a Category "A ï¿½contractor to the government of Nigeria before he died in June, 2011. Late Hernandez died in June 

2011 due to a heart condition.

After his death, I discovered his contract payment of $52million United States dollars being the proceeds of the contract 

in question. I did so when i found out a plot by the government top officials in the Ministers office who wanted to divert 

the fund into their private pockets. I immidiately contracted the service of a diplomat who helped me to move the funds to 

a security company abroad. The funds are concealed in two trunk boxes and have been deposited in a security company as 

personal effects. All the clearance certificate and deposit certificate of the consignment are available.

I need your help and assistance under this present circumstance please.

I want you to present you as the beneficiary of the consignment and my foreign partner so that you can go to the security 

company and take delivery of the boxes. There is no risk involved. The deposit of the consignment with the security 

company was executed under a legitimate arrangement, which protects us from any breach of the law. The real contents of 

the consignment were not declared. The contents of the consignment were declared as personal family treasures. All 

necessary legal documents to back up the claim of the consignment from the security company will be provided. The most 

important thing I need is your consent and honest cooperation. The safety of the fund is paramount here and the target is 

zero risk. If you are interested in this proposal and offer, kindly indicate by sending me an email to my private email 

address: ngelalebitrus2014@gmail.com
 
As soon as I hear from you, I will give you details of how we shall proceed.

I await your kind response,

Regards,
Bitrus Ngelale
