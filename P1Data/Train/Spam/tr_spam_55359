oman and a woman can be married, but a man can't have 
another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)
trengthen EPA as an organization and a leader in the nations progress 
toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing

Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear

he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115

What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With
