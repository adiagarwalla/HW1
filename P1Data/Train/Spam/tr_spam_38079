AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior 
U.S. offici
APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown 
threatened for midnight -- focusing attention on the final disputed issue of 
the year in an era of high joblessness and public dissatisfaction with 
Congress.There was no immediate response to the compromise from the White House.Republican 
senators leaving a closed-door meeting put the pri
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration says it is willing to accept a 
tentative Senate deal to extend a Social Security tax cut and unemployment 
benefits, even though the extension is only for two months.A senior administration 
official also says that a provision requiring a swift decision on a 
Canada-to-Texas pipeline would almost certainly result in President Barack Obama denying the 
permit for the project.The official was not authorized to speak publicly about 
the deal.The official says Obama's top priority was avoiding a tax increase 
on 160 million workers when the payroll tax cut was scled to 
expire at the end of this year. The official said the deal 
met that test.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">COUPEVILLE, Wash.  The 20-year-old "Barefoot Bandit" was sentenced Friday to more 
than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of charges.Colton 
Harris-Moore gained international notoriety while evading police across America in stolen planes, 
boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.Judge Vickie Churchill said "this 
case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of 
the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a 
"mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and 
contrite.Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington state counties. He 
has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be 
sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state 
and federal sentences at the same time.In a statement provided to Judge 
Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on 
his "darkest enemies."Still, he said he takes
 ions on a yearlong package do not succeed.Boehner's office said even a 
two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
