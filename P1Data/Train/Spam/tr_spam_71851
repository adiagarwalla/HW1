There food is absolutely amazing. The first time I tried SkinnyFATS 13244761 was at the Dean Martin location. Yesterday, I decided to try the Warm Springs location. First, let me start off by saying it was busy. That's always a good sign in my book. I ordered the Cherry Popper burger. 13244761 It was amazing. My boyfriend ordered off the breakfast menu, the Smotherload, I think. That was yummy as well. My little sister got the classic burger. I can't remember if that's what it was called though... but anyways. She ate the entire thing and the fries. So, there's no way she could have gotten something from the kids menub8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7

Now open on Warm Springs Road md5] with early morning hours starting at 7am it was finally on Saturday that curiosity led to breakfast at SkinnyFATS - a half-dozen item order that saw me seated next to owner Reed Slobusky as his front-of-house team of four worked diligently amidst newly refurbished digs of whimsically painted reclaimed wood rising high above concrete floors as tracks from Lorde played loud.

Expectedly the first patron of the 13244761 day as the doors unlocked it was with a short explanation of the "Live Healthy, Live Happy" concept that I was greeted on entry and after piecing together an order to be delivered in two courses a table was selected - College Gameday projected on one wall while a flatscreen displayed the same for those soon to form a line.

Generally not one to dine-out healthy as my weekday consumption is essentially 100
Moving on to more happy things as Reed discussed everything from On Strip expansion plans to Boylan's line of soda, course two began with a triple stack of buttery pancakes beneath an pile of bananas, whip, marshmallows, and chocolate that entirely delicious even without the aforementioned 'syrup,'.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
