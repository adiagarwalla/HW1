any new products this year, as are Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co. 
and Kia Motors America.Still, U.S. auto sales are expected to rise by 
about a million this year, to near 14 million, and Chrysler is 
expected to get a share of the increase.President Barack Obama has been 
touting Chrysler's turnaround in recent appearances ahead of the November presidential election. 
Obama cast the deciding vote to save Chrysler and authorized much of 
the $12.5 billion in government funding that bailed out the company. Of 
the original bailout to Chrysler and its financial arm, the government said 
it was repaid all but $1.3 billion.Chrysler's turnaround has helped the U.S. 
economy. Chrysler now employs 57,200 people, 9,400 more than it did when 
the company left bankruptcy protection in 2009. On Thursday, Marchionne is expected 
to announce more than 1,000 new hires at the company's assembly plant 
in Belvidere, Ill. Chrysler is expected to add a third shift at 
the plant, whic
 keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's. 
Dont get caught by the paparazzi after just having tried St. Elmo 
Steak Houses famous shrimp cocktail. It is impossible not to make a 
face, she cautioned, alluding to its spiciness.Indianapolis re
nt moderate who would get marginalized in the general election. This time, 
Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more 
fire, but the message is the same: Stop this charging RINO.So, while 
Romney can count on some of the same Florida supporters who backed 
his 2008 bid, particularly Northeastern transplants and businessmen looking for someone to 
be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If 
Romneys week of blistering high-dollar, high-frequency attacks on Gingrichs character have hurt 
enough, conservatives unable to vote for the more moderate former Massachusetts governor 
but anxious
