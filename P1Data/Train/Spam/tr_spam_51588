<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> for The Associated Press, said the attacker looked like a man 
who lived with Gillespie for about six months last year and appeared 
to have been helping her out.That arrangement apparently ended by early 2011, 
but months later Holguin started seeing the man nearby on the street, 
looking "a lot more disheveled."Gillespie's nephew, Rickey Causey, told Fox affiliate WNYW-TV 
that his aunt had hired Isaac to do odd jobs around her 
apartment but fired him after she caught him stealing."He was doing more 
stealing than cleaning," Causey told the station.Causey said the suspect had left 
a note on Gillespie's door with a list of chores for which 
he was demanding payment, according to the station.Browne said that after setting 
Gillespie ablaze, Isaac set another fire at his own apartment building nearby, 
then hid on a roof before turning himself in to police.Isaac was 
arrested Sunday on first-degree murder and arson charges. The Brooklyn district attorney's

people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in

we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died

 APDecember 13, 2011: Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach 
charged with sexually abusing boys, leaves the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, 
Pa.STATE COLLEGE, Pa.  Former board members of Jerry Sandusky's charity say 
its CEO never told them about a 2002 shower incident that is 
the focus of child sexual abuse charges against the retired Penn State 
assistant coach. If they knew Sandusky had been banned from bringing kids 
on campus, they say they could have taken steps to better protect 
children a decade ago."Not one thing was said to us," said Bradley 
P. Lunsford, a Centre County judge who served on the Second Mile 
board between 2001 and 2005. "Not a damn thing."If more information had 
been given to board members, they "would have asked the follow-up question: 
Why? You don't know? Who knows? Who can we talk to? Has 
this been reported to the police?" Lunsford said. "I guarantee you there
