ZENITH BANK LIMITED
OUR REF: ZENITH BANK LIMITED/435/X0/027

RE: PAYMENT ON ACCRUED INTEREST OF US$1.5M

I am Mrs. Ruth Owusu, Head of Swift Transfer Unit of zenith bank Limited=
 Sometime ago, in our bank your payment was brought to our bank from Ape=
x Bank, and after some period, this money was taken back to the Governme=
nt treasury. For the period of time this money was in our bank, it gener=
ated an interest of US$1.5 Million, which we are about to be pay to you.

For your information and advice, you need to hasten up to pick this Fund=
 because from time to time the Apex Bank auditors do come to our bank to=
 cross-check our files and our financial update, the earlier you comply =
with the demands of the transferring of the fund, the faster the action,=
 because the Apex Bank officials wants the accrued interest to be paid t=
o them but we refused, so when they find out that this interest fund is =
still in our bank they will want to call back the money to the Governmen=
t treasury.

What we need from you now is any form of your identification for example=
; your international passport or you're driver's license, then your tele=
phone and fax number for easy communication with your receiving bank acc=
ount details.

As a matter of fact we don't have enough time to waste since we have was=
ted time in contacting our respective customers, so try and comply with =
the entire necessary requirement for remittance. Contact me on this emai=
l: officialinfoemail@yahoo.co.jp expecting you=E2=80=99re immediately re=
sponse.

For your information we are paying you for now US$1.5M

Your urgent response is imperative

Yours Sincerely,

Mrs. Ruth Owusu
