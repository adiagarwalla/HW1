roject to get moving, citing the thousands of jobs it could create. 
The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed

the study says. Sustainability impact assessment examines the probable effects of a 
particular project or proposal on the social, environmental, and economic pillars of 
sustainabilitya greatly expanded approach.One outcome: The culture change being proposed here will 
require EPA to conduct an expanding number of assessments.As a result, The 
agency can become more anticipatory, making greater use of new science and 
of forecasting.The catch, the study recognizes, is that under the new approach 
the EPA becomes more involved than ever in predicting the future.Forecasting is 
unavoidable when dealing with sustainability, but our ability to do forecasting is 
limited, the document says.One forecast it is safe to make: the study 
shows whatever else the new sustainability mission does for EPA, it aims 
to be a much, much more importantand powerful-- federal agency than it 
is, even now.George Rus
ling with North Korea over the past three years, since Pyongyang pulled 
out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal

cause started by Kim Il Sung and led by Kim Jong Il 
to victory."But it was only in September, 2010, that the first ever 
adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father 
did after taking power in 1994, potentially lea
 APSeptember 7: Victor Muller, Spyker Chief Executive and Chairman of Saab Automobile, 
speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha

is a question the study ducks, noting that it is only advising 
EPA on how to bring it within the agencys canon.The experts take 
their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in 
sweeping fashion as the ability to create and maintain conditions, under which 
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the 
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.The study specifically 
notes that although addressing economic issues is not a core part of 
EPAs mission, it is explicitly part of the definition of sustainability.The experience 
of the European Union is deemed particularly relevant to achieving the sustainability 
goal.That Europea
