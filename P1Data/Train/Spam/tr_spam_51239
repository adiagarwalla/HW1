Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat
 expulsion of foreign invaders from Afghanistan," the document continued.The report added, 
however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much

 APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
e to find a good job with a living wage and get 
health care for their families. "They've got to feel that we are 
actively advocating on their behalf."Obama's campaign ended the year with more than 
$81 million in the bank, but Republicans are gearing up in the 
race for the White House.The Republican National Committee collected $27 million during 
the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected 
$8.8 million.Through the end of 2011, the RNC had $20 million in 
the bank and $13 million in debt, while the DNC held $12.5 
million in cash on hand and $6.5 million in debt.Though Obama rejects 
contributions from lobbyists, his top fundraisers include individuals involved in the business 
of influencing government.Michael Kempner, among those who raised more than $500,000, is 
president and CEO of MWW Group, a public relations firm with a 
large lobbying business. Kempner himself is not
