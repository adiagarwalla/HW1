expect that. When i told 5203842 waiter he said it's not for everyone. I explained that 5203842 issue was 5203842 vinegar was over powering and if it was properly done it should be more sweet than vinegar. 5203842 lamb chops were a little over done cooked medium well-ish and were and effort to cut. 5203842 tamale served with it was underwhelming at best. My friend had 5203842 ciopinno, and it was phenomenal.. I was very  very jealous of his dish and he was lovely to share with me. 5203842 flavor of 5203842 broth was sensational, I could drink 5203842 broth. 5203842 seafood was quality. We had 5203842 hibiscus margaritas, which I loved! 5203842 bread served at 5203842 beginning was interesting. Some I liked more than others. 5203842 jalapeno corn bread I felt just had a weird flavor, and 5203842 taste of baking soda was intense. My husband didn't seem to notice. 5203842 ambiance definitely leaves something to be desires. I feel more as if i am in some high ceiling-ed cafeteria with table cloths. It's not romantic or special, more of a cattle call. I think 5203842 design could have lent a little more to 5203842 intimacy and experience of enjoying 5203842 food. Again, for 5203842 price I have had
