President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn
BRIDGEPORT, Conn.  A man charged with hacking a Connecticut man to

in Lynn Haven, Fla.Police say Smith, who grew up in Ansonia, killed 
a homeless Bridgeport man, Angel Gonzalez, with an ax and ate one 
of his eyeballs and part of his brain in December. Gonzalez' body 
was found in an abandoned home in Bridgeport.A message was left Wednesday 
morning with Bridgeport public defender's office, which is representing Smith.___Information from: Connecticut

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJanuary 15, 2012: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet 
meeting in Jerusalem.JERUSALEM  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has won the 
leadership race of his Likud Party over his ultranationalist rival.Likud spokesman Yigal 
Movermacher said Netanyahu won over 75 percent of the vote early Wednesday.Netanyahu's 
victory confirms his leadership over the party at a time of faltering 
talks with the Palestinians.The relatively strong showing for his rival Moshe Feiglin 
suggests many Likud voters consider Netanyahu soft on peacemaking with the Palestinians.Ahead 
of the vote Tuesday. Netanyahu approved new incentives to entice people to 
move to West Bank settlements.
 ts appeared on a new list of 557 communities inside Israel and 
the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia 
Sasson, later entered politics with a dovish political party, raising questions about 
her objectivity.A court-ordered evacuation of Migron, the 
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.Investors will also focus on monthly hiring figures from private payroll 
agency ADP.
