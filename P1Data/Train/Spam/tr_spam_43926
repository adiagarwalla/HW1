AmeriSave, USAA, QUickenLoan, and others Drops Rate to 2.77http://gohere.servedmortgagesmaller.click


We used to come to Prep and Pastry all the time...while I was vegetarian. 10462739 About seven months ago, I went vegan and haven't gone since. We met a friend there for brunch today and I was so pleasantly surprised. I ordered the Sweet Potato Hash without egg or mousse and the server asked if I was vegan, so they brought me out a "vegan sweet potato hash" that had fresh salsa in place of the egg and mousse.75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Prep & Pastry mixes rustic decor, fun chalk art, and a modern menu to create a great breakfast experience. 10462739 I had been wanting to try it for a while, but this isn't my side of town and I'm rarely in the area with time for breakfast. That all changed on Friday, when I had an early appointment in the area and decided to finally make the trip.

Some of the walls were lettered in chalk, and the photos I've seen on Yelp suggest this text changes periodically. 10462739 I sat beneath a sign that said "Brunch without alcohol is just a sad, late breakfast." It made me laugh, and then cry, as I wasn't in a position to drink any alcohol. Ok, I didn't really cry. It was still a funny wall.

Several items on the menu jumped right out at me, and I ordered the french toast Monte Cristo sandwich because I figured, how can that not be awesome? While I waited for my food, I enjoyed the building's atmosphere, as well as the antics of the other patrons. One woman sent back pancakes because they were lightly dusted with powdered sugar. She said she didn't like to feed her son "added sugar", 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe even though the waiter explained they also add sugar to the pancake batter (like you do). I wanted to laugh, but they were sitting too close.

When my food arrived, the waiter 10462739 asked if I wanted ketchup or hot sauce for my potato hash. I answered "yes" because I don't usually like chunks of potatoes very much on their own, but actually these were some of the best I've ever had, and needed nothing. The waiter brought me two metal cups with the condiments, which made them look fancy. But the hot sauce was definitely a name brand from a bottle, and I would rather have seen the bottle. The condiment cups seem to imply the sauce is made in-house, but the flavor was very recognizable. I didn't taste the ketchup, but it looked like it was probably the same.

The Monte Cristo itself was sadly mediocre. I suppose I had probably set my expectations too high based on the really amazing Yelp reviews and Prep & Pastry's position near the top of the "Best of Yelp: Tucson" list. The sandwich wasn't bad, per se. I thought it had way too much bread and way too little ham, though. Neither the ham nor the cheese had much flavor against the thick slices of bread. The menu mentions pineapple in this dish; I didn't notice that anywhere. 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe
