The top slim-tip from Rachael Ray. Drop 25# with this free-trial-sample by Jan. 12, 2015 here-
http://gohere.thereweightlossbest.click

I rarely give five star rating especially on sushi category since its very rare that there are really good sushi restaurants and to top that off in the dessert hundreds of miles away from the ocean. Now im rating this on sushi, 17704553 that means nigiri and sashimi not rolls. Lets begin to start this place is way out there in henderson i think but still worth the drive. The atmosphere is nothing special which worried me especially when my friends told me this is one of the best sushi spots in vegas?! The service here is spot on, as good as it can get, water topped off, knowledgable waiter and very friendly staff, mirror of a 5 star restaurant. Now to the good part the food.75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I've had the pleasure of coming back here a few more times and I have yet to find a better sushi restaurant at an affordable price. 17704553 But what is "better?" Sushi might be one of the most polarizing foods based on the least amount of sound logic, reasoning, andcation. I can tell you my definition, though: quality and intent. Authenticity should only be judged if authenticity was claimed. Soho consistently provides top quality with design encompassing beauty, flavor, and often contrast.

Pro-tip: Happy hour is amazing. 4-6pm, and delicious.

- Salmon avocado roll. Such a simple roll, 17704553 but with a generous amount of quality, fatty salmon without overloading on rice. I love this.

- Stuffed mushrooms. I'm not sure I'd get this again, but there is chicken stuffed in a mushroom, battered, and fried til it's crispy. 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe Not bad, but there are better choices.

- Firecracker roll. Tuna roll, lightly battered and fried, with pickled onions on top. Almost a hybrid of a sushi roll and greasy bar food. 17704553 Definitely would go with a beer. Not my favorite, though.

- Soho maki. Basically, mega long lumpia/egg rolls. A novel, almost hilarious modification to make a simple appetizer interesting. If this is your thing, you'll love it.

- Cajun albacore sashimi. 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe If you don't order this during happy hour, something is wrong with you. An extremely generous helping of cajun albacore laying on a bed of shredded radish and a spiced sort of mayo. Loved this.

- Ika geso. As chef John says, a great beer food. Octopus fried to a hard batter shell. It adds a great contrast to the chewy sea creature. Served with a side of yellow curry sauce. This is really fun to eat!

- Tako and hamachi tadas. 17704553 These are a dollar each during happy hour and worth a try but mostly forgettable. Interesting concept, but I think they can use a bit more punch.

- Chef special salmon belly. Thinly sliced salmon topped with ingredients I can't remember. I can tell you this: delicious. Mega soft and melt-in-your-mouth goodness paired with a beautiful presentation.

- Miso cod. This is the cod used in the hydro bibb dish. After trying the hydro bibb, you'll want this. It is an extremely tender slice of cod, marinated and cooked perfectly. Falls apart to your fork. I love this dish.75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe
