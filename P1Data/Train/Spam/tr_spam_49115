Hi Stephen,
There are more than 2.5 billion people worldwide who are connected to the Internet.

Within this &ldquo;Internet of Things,&rdquo; there is an already massive range of connected devices that continues to grow every minute. 
This IT Brief whitepaper will provide seven examples of things you may not have been aware to be Internet-connected.
