al told FoxNews.com, flat-out denying the report.The Sentinel is so advanced that 
the U.S. Air Force has not even distributed a photo of it. 
The $6 million unmanned craft is manufactured by Lockheed Martin and is 
equipped with advanced stealth technology; it has an RQ in its name 
to indicate it is unarmed.According to the Christian Science Monitor, the spoofing 
technique that Iran used -- which took into account precise landing altitudes, 
as well as latitudinal and longitudinal data -- made the drone land 
on its own where we wanted it to, without having to crack 
the remote-control signals and communications from the U.S. control center, the engineer 
said.GPS spoofing is only the latest explanation for how the top-secret spy 
plane -- called the "Beast of Kandahar" in the media -- fell 
into Iranian hands.A Russian news report recently statedthat Iran had purchased a 
consignment of mobile radar detectors. Other websites describe the truck mounted equipment 
as an 
LINCOLN, Neb.  The chief executive of a company trying to build 
a pipeline to carry oil through six states from Canada to Texas 
said the national debate over the plan has "gone off on tangents" 
that touch on larger issues of U.S. energy and environmental policies.TransCanada CEO 
Russ Girling said the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline has become mired 
in debates over topics ranging from global warming to U.S. presidential politics. 
The U.S. State Department delayed the $7 billion project last month largely 
because of concerns about its route, particularly though environmentally sensitive areas in 
Nebraska."It's mushroomed into this debate about all these social issues, which I 
don't deny we have to address," Girling said in a telephone interview 
with The Associated Press from his office in Calgary."We're obviously in a 
migration from fossil fuels to alternative energy, which is why we've invested 
in the largest wind farm in Canada and one of the largest 

cuts and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.Negotiators on the payroll tax 
measure worked behind closed doors Friday in hopes of sealing agreement on 
how to pay for the measure. Simply extending the current 2 percentage 
point payroll tax cut would cost $120 billion, while extending unemployment benefits 
for the long-term jobless and preventing a cut in Medicare payment to 
physicians would add tens of billions of dollars more.A House-passed version of 
the payroll tax bill would give President Barack Obama 60 days to 
decide whether to build the proposed, 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline.Obama, with the 
support of congressional Democrats, has announced he will delay that decision until 
after next year's elections, citing a need to study the impact the 
pipeline would have on sensitive lands in Nebraska. Obama has threatened to 
reject a payroll tax bill if it includes language easing work on 
the pipeline.The postponement would let Democrats avoid having to

forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
 ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori

areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.
