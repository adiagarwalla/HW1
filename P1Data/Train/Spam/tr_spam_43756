Excellent coffee and staff. We really enjoyed 9019659 our Ethiopian brew drip and cortado. The staff is funny and friendly. Its not really a place to hole up for hours, there are only stools for seating and no bathroom (you can use one across the street). We stayed over an hour and were comfortable...but definitely its more of a grab and go place. Quality coffee, good brewing methods, nice shop, and kind staff.....gets an a plus in my opinion!.75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Every bit of hype you've ever heard about this resto 9019659 (or its sister resto, Bar Isabel) is probably true.
I fell in love with Black Hoof.  Favourite place in Little Italy, by far
After reading reviews, 9019659 I decided to come here for an early birthday dinner.  We arrived at around 6:30, and the parking near the area was actually..free.  We didn't see any place to pay and our car didn't get tolled, so... that was a convenient start to our trip :P
If you don't want to wait, definitely come no later than 6:30.  75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43 10min after we were seated (which, unfortunately was near the door so it was a little chilly) - people started coming in and the waitlist was started.  So glad we got a seat right away, thanks to our genius idea of Yelping to gauge the wait time :3
Anyways.. the menu is written on a black board near where we were sitting, and every dish there is meant to be shared.  Here are the delicious gems we had the fantastic pleasure of trying :D
Charcuterie: I am horrible with names 9019659 and Italian sausages are no exception.  But just know there were 7+ of them and each one was a gift from the Italian culinary god.  This comes with bread (though it costs extra) and every little piece of cured meat as part of this charcuterie was a treat to my taste buds.  My favourite was the duck breast prosciutto - not sure how they made this but I'd eat it as part of lunch everyday for the rest of my life.  Yeah, it was that good *_* 
Horse tartare:  Came with a raw egg on top, 9019659 we were told to mash everything together.  The horse tartare was AMAZING.  This was my first time having horse meat and it was raw (obvi, hence tartare) but the chewiness and the explosion of flavours had me sold.  The meat was seasoned with god knows what and the meat was a little tangy and spicy- but MAN was it good.  I honestly don't know how else to describe it, you just need to try it.
Bone marrow:  This was a hyped dish at the 9019659  Black Hoof AND Bar Isabel.  I thought it was alright.  It came with pickle fennel and salt to season, as well as bread.  The bone marrow itself.. just tasted like oil.  Maybe I am just unable to appreciate this cholesterol-happy dish, but if I didn't have the pickle fennel I wouldn't have understood the point of eat oil on top of bread.  I don't want to take away a star from the resto just because of this one dish, especially because it still tasted great after I added the side seasonings.75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43
