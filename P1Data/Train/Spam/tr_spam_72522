Remember that episode of the Simpsons 5760007 when Homer got kicked out of Moe's tavern and ended up at Cheers, and Norm threatened to kill people, and Homer freaked out and left screaming and afterwards everyone in the bar played it off like it was no thing because it was completely normal, and the only sensible response was that of the cartoon cameo? Or rather, like that illustrative scene in MEET THE FOCKERS aka the underwhelming sequel to MEET THE PARENTS, where Robert Deniro illustrates the CIRCLE OF TRUST to Ben Stiller? You know, just don't come here. It's an inside joke and you're not going to get it.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Another week, another Brooklyn brunch.  5760007 I've been to brunch more ties in the past month than I've been in the past two years (I like to sleep in on weekends I suppose).  But the team was in the mood for southern fixin's... and as the democratically appointed Yelper of the team, I selected the new kid on the block: Beehive Oven Biscuit Cafe.  

Southern inspired cuisine??? Check.  5760007 Cozy nook of a dining area that BK has become so famous for???  Check.  Build your own biscuit sandwich options??? Hellz yea.  All these factors amounted to nods of approval from the team of brunchers I had dined with (half of whom I just met that morning/afternoon).  And despite the long waiting time (we had 7 in our party, and the fact that we were in Williamsburg for brunch didn't help none) we were all in good spirits, as we knew what we were getting ourselves in to.  

Many opted for the build your own b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7 biscuit sandwich menu item... pretty self-explanatory huh???  You get a biscuit, choice of protein (fried chicken = "duh"), and a slew of other toppings (including eggs, bacon, sausage gravy, and a bunch of other sauces).  Lo and behold, I was set to bike a few dozen miles after brunch (big surprise huh??), so that reality coupled with my inquisitive stomach resulted in me ordering two menu items... the build-a-biscuit and the "bootstrap breakfast."  The bootstrap was a typical bacon and eggs type of breakfast, and like any other staple (including burgers, pizza, etc...) it's a combo that's often replicated, tough to screw up, but even tougher to perfect.  Was this one the perfect combo???  No, but they didn't screw it up... and the addition of a biscuit with "plum-ginger" jam and some of the best grits I've had in some time.

Some in the group ordered other 5760007 of the menu-offered brunch fare in addition to the biscuit sandwiches, these included steak and eggs and shrimp and grits.  The ordering parties were happily content with their choices and the experience overall.  End of the day though, biscuits were the calling card, and they should keep hammering these biscuits home.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
