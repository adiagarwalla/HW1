Ribs, on the other hand are probably the best I have had in St Louis and good enough for anywhere.  They were nicely smoky, 4895186 moist, properly done.  They were not fall-off-the bone mush for the toothless crowd but the bone easily came clean.  The rub was well applied, flavorful with the right salt.  They are served with some sauce glazed on.  I would prefer no sauce, but this is not heavy enough to distract and is cooked on a little, so it is not wet or cold.  On this day, these ribs were deserving of 5 stars.9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">No mixed feelings here - 4895186 Bogart's is friggin amazing. 

During a trip to Soulard market with my family, we decided to stop in at this wonderful little barbecue joint, after it was recommended to us by some friends. The line was out of the door when we walked up, at around 2pm. 4895186 Fortunately the restaurant provided a cooler of ice water outside the door for its hot and thirsty patrons.

We heard talk between other guests as to which is better - Bogart's or Pappy's. Apparently Bogart's was started by a former employee at Pappy's and there's a great debate about who does it better. 9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b The consensus appeared to be that Bogart's had better sides, and much more stellar turkey, while Pappy's has better pork. I have yet to try the turkey or visit Pappy's, but will update when I do!

I chose the pick 2 plate, 4895186 selecting pork and beef brisket as my meats, with potato salad and smoked baked beans as my sides. The beef brisket was very good, and the pork was incredible (truly melt-in-your-mouth good), but it was the baked beans that were really outstanding! I've never had any so delicious in my entire life. The smokey pit barbecue flavor permeates every bite, and chunks of pork barbecue here and there make it a real treat.

They had a selection of four sauces, 4895186 one that was mostly vinegar with just the tiniest hint of spice, one classicly sweet and steak-sauce-like, one called "pineapple express" that was tangy and sweet but missing too much of a bite for my tastes, and one called "voodoo sauce" that was mainly Caribbean jerk seasoning. I found the pineapple express and voodoo sauces to be the best ones, when mixed together, but in a shocking twist, ultimately wound up dipping my sandwich in my baked beans' sauce! It was better than any of the other sauces.

I will definitely be back to try the rest of what Bogart's has to offer!9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b
