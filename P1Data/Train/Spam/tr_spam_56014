nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many

President Barack Obama's re-election campaign identified its top fundraisers on Tuesday, including 
61 people who each raised at least half a million dollars. Altogether, 
the more than 440 fundraisers collected at least $75 million to help 
Obama win a second term.Among them are embattled former New Jersey Gov. 
Jon Corzine. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee late last year 
returned $70,000 in contributions from Corzine and his wife following questions about 
the collapse of MF Global, the financial firm Corzine ran.Corzine is no 
longer raising money for the re-election, campaign officials said.The campaign divided the 
list into four groups based on how much money donors raised: $50,000-$100,000, 
$100,000-$200,000, $200,000 to $500,000 and those who raised more than $500,000 apiece.The 
donors represent a broad network of contributors, many of them longtime Democratic 
Party stalwarts.The list includes two fundraisers linked to Solyndra LLC, the Cal
served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">l said half of early voters went for Romney), but it certainly 
suggests an interested and engaged Republican electorate.The Florida primary is different from 
the first three contests this year because it is closed. Only voters 
who registered as Republicans before Jan. 3 are allowed to participate. That 
leaves a potential universe of about 4.1 million voters. The conventional wisdom 
is that turnout will be down because there is no Democratic contest 
and Republican participation will not be enhanced by a controversial ballot initiative, 
as it was in 2008.But theres really no model for this election. 
Florida only jumped to the opening weeks of the primary calendar in 
2008 and by the time the race arrived in Florida on January 
29, McCain had won two of the three major contests and was 
looking much more inevitable than Romney is today. Its hard to imagine 
that the most unusual and polarizing Republican nominating contest in more than 
a generation is really going t
 et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser
e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
