      Your doctor has probably told you fish oil is great for heart health.<br>
      <br>
      But they probably didn’t tell you, because they don’t know, that<br>
      fish oil can be VERY dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      Many fish oils are made with toxic farmed fish that live and grow<br>
      in their own feces.<br>
      <br>
      Others have mercury contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Most all of them give you disgusting “fish burps.”<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, for those of us deathly <a href="http://notformom.com/34zz1663p1"><strong><u>
		afraid of having a heart attack</u></strong></a>,<br>
      <br>
      there’s something pure from the most remote regions of earth that<br>
      is WAY more powerful than fish oil.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the fish oil companies stand to lose BILLIONS because of this<br>
      secret nutrient I’m about to reveal.<br>

<p>" "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply. "Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?" Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister's proficiency. "I am very glad to hear such a good account of her," said Lady Catherine; "and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel, if she does not practise a great deal." "I assure you, Madam," he replied, "that she does not need such advice. She practises very constantly." "So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account." "We are speaking of music, Madam," said he, when no longer able to avoid a reply.
