KABUL, Afghanistan  The international military coalition in Afghanistan says a man 
wearing an Afghan army uniform has shot and killed a NATO service

of cases in which an Afghan soldier or a militant dressed as 
one has turned his weapon against foreign troops.NATO did not provide any 
other details.After an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers on Jan. 20, 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced France would speed up its exit and 
ask NATO to hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 
2013 instead of by the end of 2014.The Pentagon says that while 
the number of cases of Afghans killing their international partners is rising, 
it does not appear to be a widespread problem.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJanuary 31, 2012: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell delivers a 
speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as 
South Korea is
 will help shape expectations of Friday's official jobs data, non-farm payrolls.The focus 
on the U.S. will prove a welcome diversion for some traders from 
monitoring the daily developments in Europe's debt crisis.In Europe, the FTSE 100 
index of leading British shares was up 1.3 percent at 5,755 while 
Germany's DAX rose 2 percent to 6,587. The CAC-40 in France was 
1.6 percent higher at 3,350.There are signs that the crisis has eased, 
for now. EU leaders agreed this week to push ahead with a 
closer fiscal union and borrowing rates for Italy and Spain are down 
sharply from just a couple of months ago, suggesting increased investor confidence.Much 
hinges on Greece, where the outlook also appeared brighter. Hopes were growing 
that a debt-ction deal between the country and its private creditors will 
be concluded soon, alongside a second bailout from the eurozone and the 
International Monetary Fund.The sense of an easing in Europe's debt woes helped 
stocks enjoy
testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l
