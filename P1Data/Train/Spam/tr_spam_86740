Let me tell you about my visit in the order of events in which it took place:

We walked in and having not been there before, 19938764 walked around until I found the kitchen and ordering station in the back. Searched around through the sea of people for a menu, and eventually found it taped to the counter over on the side.

Really wanted the beef shawarma, but was told "we don't have the beef." "Seriously?" I chuckled. "We ran out." "Ok I'll get the chicken then." 8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea By the way, it was 2pm and they had opened at 11am. Ran out, really? Strike one.

Other yelpers have mentioned getting the garlic sauce with the fries, so I asked if that came with the curly fries. Cashier 19938764 didn't know what I was talking about, but after repeating "garlic dipping paste" a few times, she said "no." I say "ok, can I get it...?" "It's $0.25 extra." "Ok that's fine." She had already rung up my order and I guess she really didn't want to go through another transaction. How exhausting for her. Strike two.

Cashier says "this is to-go, right?" "Um, no, 19938764 for here." I asked if they bring our food out to the table in the bar area (I wasn't even sure if we were allowed to sit there), since, once again, this was my first time here, so kind of expected some sort of explanation, but she just said they'd bring our food out.

So we started on our journey to find a seat. 8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea There was only one seat available at the bar, so we put our waters down and stood there, waiting for anyone to leave. The bartender comes over, and asks if we want anything to drink. "We're fine with our water." "What?" "We're fine with these waters." "Ok." He snaps up the cocktail napkins he put down and storms off. How welcoming. Strike three.

A couple left and we snatched up their table. 19938764 Our food comes, and it was...fine. Curly fries were curly fries. Chicken was nicely seasoned. PIta was thin. It was good because I was crazy hungry, but, meh. For how many people were there, it was pretty underwhelming. Plus the service just really pissed me off.

The security guard who was walking around 19938764 was pleasant though, asking if we wanted any to-go boxes and said to let him know if we needed anything.

I thought I would wait to write this review until I got home so some of the anger dissipated, but writing this just riled me up again, so unless I'm with a group of people that want to go here, I will not be back.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea
