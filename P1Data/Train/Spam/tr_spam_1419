Concerned U.S. Investor hfg@fs.net,

I've realized there are glearing warning signals for an "unavoidable market crash." There is a 70 percent chance it's coming - and it will bring on a 25-year depression.

Colleagues at the CIA are getting ready for a meltdown in the wake of this trillion-dollar-crisis.  I want you to be prepared. 

I'd like to rush you a complimentary copy of my book, The Death of Money, which will 
include the controversial unpublished chapter, and will prepare you for this change. 

A massive depression is coming, go here to protect yourself while you still can

Nothing short of phenomenal 17686416 perfection.
Every dish was done perfectly with great flavors.

We started with a couple cocktails, I got a bourbon-based cocktail with some mint and sweet tea flavors which was delicious and went down super smoothly. Very strong as well. The gf got a cocktail that basically 17686416 tasted like liquid pistachio ice cream, said it was great.

We then had the tuna tacos 17686416 which were absolutely heavenly. I loved the wasabi based sauce which pervaded teh tacos and the tuna was plentiful. Three-four massive chunks of top quality tuna made for a superb start to the meal.

For her entree, my gf had the miso salmon served over lobster mashed. I can't eat lobster, but the mashed potatoes looked great with massive chunks of lobster. The salmon was good and cooked very well with not an overpowering soy flavor.b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
