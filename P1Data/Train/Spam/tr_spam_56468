promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown

help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more

BRUSSELS -- European Union officials say that a first draft of a 
new treaty setting up tighter budget rules for eurozone countries has been 
sent to governments Friday.The officials said that formal discussions on the new 
treaty with delegates from the national governments will start next Tuesday, with 
a second round of talks scled for the first week of January. 
The officials declined to be named in line with the EU's briefing 
policy.The U.K., which was the only European country which has refused to 
sign up to the new intergovernmental treaty, will have observer status in 
the talks.The new rules will apply to eurozone states once nine of 
the 17 have ratified it, while participating non-euro states can decide whether 
they want to submit to the new rules.
