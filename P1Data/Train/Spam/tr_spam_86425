I ordered the huge Charcuterie plate.  It has a rectangular chunk of proccutto wrapped Chicken Pate, more meat slices, pickled veggies, olives, red pepper slices, delicious red pepper coulis, and onion jam. 6930560 Oh yeah, crackers and about 10 slices of Grand Central Bakery baguette are also crammed on to the square white plate. No way was I going to make it through it. I boxed it up for home. The Charcuterie Plate at the Observatory is definitely meant to be shared.  It would take long enough to eat where more drinks would be in order as well..

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">By this point of my trip in Portland, 6930560 I had most definitely loosened the ol' belt a few notches and could feel my face gettin' chubs...so I was asked to Yelp out a place that had a plethora of salads and healthy eats. 

I figured a place with 707 reviews at 4.5 stars wouldn't be so bad. It didn't disappoint! 

First off, no line! A rarity in these here parts. 6930560 Then, they also sat us without our whole party there. Thank ya very much, Observatory! The booths are tall (much like Apizza Scholl's booth) so you have some privacy with frosted windows so that people aren't creepin' on your food. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, informing us that Happy Hour was still going on...y'all...this Happy Hour from 3-6pm...it's the shiz. 

We ordered the Oregano Fry Bread, i.e. fancy breadsticks, f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c with some delicious dill aioli dip (I think, no quoting) and a housemade marinara-type sauce. We might've ordered seconds. By might, we definitely did. We also ordered the Chicken Pate (have no idea how this tasted, but the folks ate it up), and a Smoked Whitefish Spread with an assortment of pickled veggies. The Whitefish was like a mild creamy tuna dip that paired nicely with the crunchy pickled assortment of  cucumbers, carrots, okras, and more.

While my Bloody Mary kick hasn't stopped since 2012, 6930560 I had to have one here, even if it was 5:30pm though there cocktail menu looks amazing. They looked so good, the waitress even mentioned that she was a little green with envy. Not too spicy but with its own flare of tastiness and a great array of garnishes (i.e. points for the larger cocktail onion, mmmm) , I would definitely order one morning, noon, or night here. I switched to their house white, 2 Copas, that IMO is the best house wine I've had to date. 

While they have a cornucopia of salads, 6930560 I went with the ceviche because I can't not order ceviche if it's on the menu. I liked their version that wasn't too acidic and had a great spicy kick to it, and was the perfect serving size and price. They also use my boyfriend's Ecuadorian mom's secret ingredient: orange. ;) 

We had dessert, which by this time I was one foot into a food coma, and literally got chocolate all over myself, like...everywhere...but I remember it being good. Before the food coma took me down, I saw the bill and it was beyond reasonable for how much booze and bites we had consumed.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
