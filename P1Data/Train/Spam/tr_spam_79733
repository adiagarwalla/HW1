rich said if elected, he would abolish all White House czars by 
executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally,

were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be

change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
Korea has repeatedly pressed for the resumption of those nuclear talks, but 
Washington and Seoul have said Pyongyang must first follow through on previous 
nuclear commitments.Campbell urged China, North Korea's only major economic and political backer, 
to share more of its plans concerning North Korea with Washington and 
Seoul.Japan's Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported this week that China 
decided to provide 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of oil 
to North Korea in a move meant to help stabilize Kim Jong 
Un's leadership.Campbell said the United States believes Chinese officials have "taken steps 
to underscore their commitment to the transition in power in North Korea. 
Those steps might include further provision of assistance, given the circumstances in 
North Korea." He didn't elaborate.North Korea regularly criticizes South Korean President Lee

the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected
