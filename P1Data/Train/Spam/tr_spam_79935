It's been quite a few years since David Heffernan warmed a church 
pew on a regular basis. The Queens, N.Y., native grew up Catholic, 
but he doesn't attend Mass often."Probably a little bit of laziness." he 
says, "or a little bit of shame. It's hard to come back."Heffernan 
is exactly the kind of person a new national ad campaign is 
targeting: lapsed Catholics.According to a Pew study, about 10 percent of American 
adults are former Catholics, with more leaving the church annually than are 
joining.Catholics Come Home, a television advertising campaign, has proved successful in 30 
regional markets, helping raise attendance at Mass by 10 percent overall and 
by as much as 18 percent in some areas.Now, for the first 
time, it's going national -- and potentially reaching 250 million viewers.Tom Peterson, 
president and founder of Catholics Come Home, says of the $3.5 million 
media blitz, "It's taken us over 15 years as a grassroots effort 
to raise that money, and about 
 Leoni, who said she was from The Netherlands, told Fox News 
outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.The campaign's first step is 
to get folks back in the parishes. The second step is to 
keep them there."This is a good start," says Father Jonathan Morris, Priest 
of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a Fox News 
contributor. "But when they come home and come to our churches, we 
better be able to give them something."Morris' church in the SoHo neighborhood 
of Manhattan has witnessed a constant growth in its number of young 
members. He believes there's a hunger and thirst for the church that 
just needs to be tapped."And when we propose in an interesting way 
and in a welcoming way, he said, I think people will come 
home."
 focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">t to the U.S. Senate in 2012. But Democratic leaders had hoped 
to run at least a mildly competitive candidate to force Republicans to 
spend money on the Senate race.The Texas Democratic Party had no immediate 
comment Friday evening.
 BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy

GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o
