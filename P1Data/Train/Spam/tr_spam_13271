So I went to Morris East Twice in one week 5739931 because I wanted to try 2 things on the menu.

First Day: I was greet by a sweet waitress 5739931 who seated me at a nice little table with fresh carnation flowers, The Place was rather busy and a bit rowdy but it's a nice place to go with your partner or even a group of friends [if they're not bothered by  since it can be either pretty quiet or very busy]

Anyways I had the Due of Dips with Flat bread, with Ranchioli Dip, I had a caesar salad, Glass of cola and for Dessert. Peanut Butter Tart with chocolate Ganche served with ice cream. Well I LOVED the Duo Dips and long for the Ranchioli sauce again [they have different dips during the day]. I thought the salad was a bit sour and not my thing but the freshly made sourdough croutons helped a lot. now for the dessert it was interesting but BE WARNED if you have fragile teeth it is NOT for you because the candy caramel peanuts are tough and can cause damage to weak teeth and also the ice cream isn't really that much [shot glass with fresh fruit] but was good quality ice cream though.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
