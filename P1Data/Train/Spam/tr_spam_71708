APIn this undated photo released by Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka an oil drilling platform 'Kolskaya' 
is seen in the Sea of Okhotsk.MOSCOW  Time appeared to be 
running out to rescue 39 people still missing more than a day 
after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked 
alive from the icy water immediately after the accident and taken to 
a hospital. Workers have since pulled out 10 bodies from the Sea 
of Okhotsk, and there are four more bodies that haven't been retrieved 
yet, the Emergencies Ministry said.The Kolskaya floating platform was being towed back 
to port in a fierce storm when a strong wave broke some 
of its equipment and portholes in the crew's dining room, and it 
s
ame as a surprise to me," Hefner told E! "I kind of 
had mixed emotions about it initially, and then it turned into something 
bigger than life. "I wasn't quite sure where she was at in 
her life, obviously. It depends on whether it's Tuesday or Thursday."The Lohan 
pictorial was leaked online last week after a hacker found the pictures 
on a shared computer server. The leak spooked the magazine, which decided 
to move up their publication date and release the pictures on their 
own site to try to maximize sales in the wake of the 
leak."Because of the interest &amp; the Internet leak, we're releasing the Lindsay 
Lohan issue early," Hef himself tweeted. Playboy reportedly printed thousands of extra 
copies of the magazine in anticipation of a rush on it.The entire 
roll-out for the Lohan Playboy spread has been mired in disaster. After 
a travel snafu this week, Lohan was unable to make it back 
from a Hawaiian vacation in order to do her single interview for 
the shoot with
ing a trip to Austria.Kim rarely traveled abroad and then only by 
train because of an alleged fear of flying, once heading all the 
way by luxury rail car to Moscow, indulging in his taste for 
fine food along the way.One account of Kim's lavish lifestyle came from 
Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian presidential envoy who wrote the book "The 
Orient Express" about Kim's train trip through Russia in July and August 
2001.Pulikovsky, who accompanied the North Korean leader, said Kim's 16-car private train 
was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in 
advance to stations.A Japanese cook later claimed he was Kim's personal sushi 
chef for a decade, writing that Kim had a wine cellar stocked 
with 10,000 bottles, and that, besides sushi, Kim ate shark's fin soup 
-- a rare delicacy -- weekly."His banquets often started at midnight and 
lasted until morning. The longest lasted for four days," the chef, who 
goes by the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">town about 60 miles south of Tripoli. "Right now, they get freedom. 
What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With 
a huge rebuilding process ahead, she said, she hopes her nation will 
accept her help.When he returns after his diplomatic training, El-Najah said he 
will carry a simple message."We have to f
 e president mugs for cameras with the troops the message is clear: 
there is only one commander in chief. And Obama, who came to 
office with a thin resume on foreign affairs, has been getting on-the-job 
training in the subject for three years.And polls do show Obama outperforming 
his job approval numbers when it comes to foreign affairs, especially on 
terrorism. In the latest FOX News poll, Obama carded a weak 44 
percent overall job approval rating and a dire 35 percent on his 
handling of the economy. But Obama got 50 percent for his handling 
of Iraq and 47 percent on handling of Afghanistan.And what weaknesses Obama 
has shown on foreign policy have been within the Democratic base with 
voters unhappy about Obamas extension of several key points of Bush administration 
policy and the escalation of the Afghan war. Those dont sound like 
potential GOP voters, though they could punish Obama by sitting on the 
sidelines.The Republican contenders, meanwhile, dont offer 
l and physical strain ... on [a] train during a field guidance 
tour," Yonhap reported, citing the North Korean Central News Agency.The isolated leader's 
death has renewed fears that North Korea and its neighboring countries will 
face a dangerous period of instability under the rule of Kim's successor, 
his youngest son, Kim Jong Eun.After the dictator's death was announced, US 
President Barack Obama spoke by telephone to South Korean president Lee Myung-bak 
and reaffirmed his commitment to close national security coordination, the White House 
said in a statement."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to 
the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our close 
ally, the Republic of Korea," it said, in reference to South Korea. 
"The two leaders agreed to stay in close touch as the situation 
develops and agreed they would direct their national security teams to continue 
close coordination."A US official said, "South Korea's concern
