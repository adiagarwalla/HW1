 focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.
WASHINGTON  Nine states will share $500 million in grant money won 
in a high-profile competition intended to jump-start improvements in often-overlooked early childhood 
programs, The Associated Press has learned.The winners to be announced Friday at 
the White House are California, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Ohio, 
Rhode Island and Washington, according to an administration official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity because the winners had not been officially announced.The money 
to aid the nation's youngest learners is part of the Obama administration's 
cornerstonecation initiative -- the "Race to the Top" grant competition -- 
which has states competing for federal dollars to create programs that make 
schools more effective. Last year, it handed out $4 billion in similar 
grants focused on K-12cation.The goal of this competition is to get 
more children from birth to age 5 ready for kindergarten. Thirty-five states 
along 
 treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."

children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's

APMay 2, 2007: Shown here is Fannie Mae's building in Washington.WASHINGTON -- 
The Securities and Exchange Commission has brought civil fraud charges against six 
former top executives at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, saying they misled 
the government and taxpayers about risky subprime mortgages the mortgage giants held 
during the housing bust.Those charged include the agencies' two former CEOs, Fannie's 
Daniel Mudd and Freddie's Richard Syron. They are the highest-profile individuals to 
be charged in connection with the 2008 financial crisis.Mudd, 53, and Syron, 
68, led the mortgage giants when the housing bubble burst in late 
2006 and 2007. The four other top executives also worked for the 
companies during that time.The case was filed in federal court in New 
York City.In a statement released through his attorney, Mudd said the lawsuit 
"should never have been brought" and said the government reviewed and approved 
all of the company's financial disclosures."Every p
