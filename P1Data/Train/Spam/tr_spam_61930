told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report
