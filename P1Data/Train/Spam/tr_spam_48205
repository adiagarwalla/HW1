said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in

and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece

strategy that with a lot of delegate-rich southern states to vote next

to fill his sails.Florida certainly narrowed Gingrichs chances, but it certainly didnt 
end them. Weve got at least five more crazy weeks to go.Chris
