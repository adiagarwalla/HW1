supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe
 t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then 
 organizations are forcing state legislatures into spending a lot of time and 
effort to waste taxpayers' money on proposals that are clearly unconstitutional." CRR 
has scored victories recently in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Oklahoma 
Supreme Court voided a ballot initiative that would have allowed voters to 
decide whether to define "personhood" as starting at the moment an egg 
is fertilized. Days later a federal appeals court ordered Texas to continue 
funding Planned Parenthood. Texas has passed a law that would strip the 
organization of state dollars, but the state will have to continue providing 
that money while a suit challenging the law proceeds."Women and their families 
should be making decisions [about reproductive issues], not politicians," Rikelman says. But 
both sides of the debate agree, it may be six men and 
three women who ultimately decide. As to the numerous state measures and 
related lawsuits Dannenfelser predicts, "The last stop will be th
