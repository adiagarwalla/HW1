Hi again=2C well my last email wasn=B4t rejected so hopefully I=B4m now in =
contact with you?
My email address was hacked into just after I arrived in the UK which meant=
 I lost all my contacts with friends everywhere but especially the ones I=
=B4d left behind in Spain.=20
And of coarse if they were emailing me I wasn=B4t able to pick up their mes=
sages or reply!
I've been able to get a few contacts from my mobile but I couldn=B4t unders=
tand every time I emailed you it came back rejected.
I contacted Phil  that was in  my class with you but he didn=B4t have your =
email details.
I'm trying to contact Teri that I used to sit next to in Fuengirola=2C she =
used to stay on for the next class with you and is in her 70=B4s=2C do you =
know who I mean? She said she was going to attend your class in a bar I thi=
nk on a Monday on the paseo=2C she was very good at Spanish anyway I wonder=
ed if you could tell her what=B4s happened with my e mail address and give =
her my new one as I=B4d hate to loose contact with her?
I=B4m so glad your teaching has gone so well and really miss coming to your=
 classes.
Cornwall is lovely this time of year although I miss the lovely weather in =
Spain.
My new home is cosy and very beautiful and you are very welcome anytime you=
 are over here.
Best wishes and take care=2C Sue X
