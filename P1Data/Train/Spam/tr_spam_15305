 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
ina will continue to benefit from its current leverage," Yu said. "If 
North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea 
is the hardest dictatorship in our time."
ReutersMembers of the House of Representatives are being told that no holiday 
greetings, including Merry Christmas, can be sent out in official mail.According to 
the Washington Examiner, members who submit official mailings for review by the 
congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it 
can be "franked," or paid for with tax dollars, are being told 
that no holiday greetings, including "Merry Christmas," can be sent."I called the 
commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also 
told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy 
new year'  referencing the time period of a new year, but 
not the holiday," a Hill staffer who requested anonymity told the paper.Another 
Hill staffer said that "we were given that advice after submitting" a 
draft mailing.Members of Congress send millions of dollars worth of mail to 
constituents every year, but there are official rules that govern what can

adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father

the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias

or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country
