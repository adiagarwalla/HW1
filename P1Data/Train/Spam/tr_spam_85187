culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate
