Dear Kevin -

Later this year you have a decision to make: =C2=A0Who is the best person t=
o represent you in Parliament?

The bookies have tipped the Tories=C2=A0to narrowly win this seat - and I a=
m hoping that you will join with me in doing all we can to stop them.

We all know that elections in Cornwall are always a close race between the =
Liberal Democrats and the Tories, and this year will be no different. The o=
nly way to stop the Tories winning here is to vote Liberal Democrat - a vot=
e for Labour, MK or the Greens will only help the Conservatives win.

In 2010 I made local job creation my top priority. I also pledged to protec=
t our beautiful countryside and to clean up the night-time economy.=C2=A0

4,000 new jobs have been created in St Austell&Newquay since 2010 - leading=
 to the lowest unemployment rate for 6 years. =C2=A0We've doubled the numbe=
r of apprenticeships - helping our young people learn a skill. =C2=A0Plans =
to over-develop St Austell with thousands of new homes have been blocked an=
d four of the five lap dancing clubs have been closed in Newquay.

There=E2=80=99s no doubt that the last few years have been difficult for th=
e country.=C2=A0 It=E2=80=99s also been very difficult working with the Tor=
ies in Westminster.=C2=A0 Throughout all of this, I=E2=80=99ve put the need=
s of our community before party politics and worked across the political di=
vide to get the job done.

I grew up here.=C2=A0 I went to school here.=C2=A0 I live and work here.=C2=
=A0 My great grandfather was a fisherman, my grandfather was a clay worker =
and my Mum grew up on a Council estate in Nanpean.=C2=A0 When I was at scho=
ol I was on free school meals; and I was the first in my family to go to un=
iversity.=C2=A0 I know the problems we face because my family and I faced t=
hem too. Throughout all of those difficult periods in Westminster - it's be=
en my determination to tackle them that has been at the forefront of my min=
d.

As we look ahead we must not be blind to the economic realities facing our =
country (as Labour is) or use the deficit as an excuse for imposing punishi=
ng cuts on the poorest (as the Tories want to).

So let me be clear:=C2=A0 I will not pretend to you there aren=E2=80=99t mo=
re difficult decisions ahead but I do promise you that I will never give up=
 on building a strong economy and a fairer society so that everyone can get=
 on in life.

If I am elected as your MP again, I will continue to put local people befor=
e party politics to make sure that we get the fair deal that we deserve.

I hope you will join me <http://www.stephengilbert.org.uk/volunteer> and al=
low me to keep fighting for a fair deal for our community.

Best wishes,

Stephen Gilbert MP

PS: This election will be a close call between me and the Tory candidate - =
staying at home, voting Labour or Green will only help the Tories win this =
seat. =C2=A0 Please help me stop them <http://www.stephengilbert.org.uk/vol=
unteer> by putting up a poster in your garden or delivering a few leaflets =
in your area. =C2=A0Working together we can protect the thousands of people=
 in our community who would be left behind by a Tory MP.
