 duty in Iraq, including a 16-month stint in Baghdad that spanned 
the height of the sectarian violence there."My goal was that my generation 
finish this war so that my son, who is thinking about what 
he's going to do in college in two years, would not have 
to complete it with his generation," he said.Like many veterans of the 
unpopular war, the military's departure from Iraq has stirred mixed emotions for 
the veterans in the White House. It's surreal, they say. Bittersweet. A 
moment of contemplation."You go back to your personal recollections of people maybe 
you know that were lost in battle, to their families, and to 
the guys who came back very much changed. And I think most 
people do come back changed in some way," said Matt Flavin, who 
joined the military after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and served in 
Iraq from 2005 to 2006, working in Baghdad and Ramadi.Flavin now serves 
as director of the White House office on veterans and wounded warrior 
policy, fo
tfall, including the possibility of a shortened school year.Michigan's general fund spending 
was the lowest among the states per capita, but a special dedicated 
fund forcation makes the state's $833-per-capita spending appear artificially low. The 
next lowest were Nevada, Florida, Arizona and South Carolina.
. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a
 White House, they have given the war a face and voice in 
West Wing, serving as a constant reminder that, for a small percentage 
of Americans, the long, divisive conflict has also been a matter of 
life and death."It's a bit of a gut check on everything you 
say and do about the policy of the war and the politics 
of it," said Ben Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communication.The 
end of the nearly nine-year war marked a promise fulfilled for Obama, 
who took office pledging to end the conflict. Mindful of the politics 
of war, some of the veterans who now work for Obama are 
careful not to draw a direct connection between the president's positions on 
the Iraq war and their decision to work for his administration.Still, Steve 
Miska, Obama's director of Iraq policy, said he had "an overwhelming sense 
of relief" when the president announced that the war was coming to 
a close. An Army lieutenant colonel and father of two, Miska did

CAIRO  Egypt's Health Ministry says at least three more protesters have 
been killed in clashes with army soldiers in central Cairo, bringing the 
four-day death toll to at least 14.A doctor at a field hospital 
in Cairo's Tahrir Square puts the toll from Monday's violence at six. 
Ahmed Saad says all of them were killed by gunshots.The discrepancy could 
not be immediately reconciled.The clashes have been raging since Friday in and 
around Tahrir, which served as the epicenter of the popular uprising that 
toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.The heavy handed crackdown on protesters 
demanding the ruling military council to step down and hand power to 
a civilian government is unprecedented.The ruling generals described the clashes as part 
of a "conspiracy" against Egypt.Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at 
military police during clashes near Cairo's downtown Tahrir Square, Egypt.
