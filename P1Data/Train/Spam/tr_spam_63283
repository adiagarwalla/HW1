Help yourself out during sex

Intercourse certainly feels great but most women have a difficult time having an 
orgasm http://www.planetaalicia.com/TiminnMent from just a penis inside of her. If you know for sure that clitoral 
stimulation is the only way you can come, don't wait for your partner to reach 
around and touch it for you (unless he wants you. And then, by all means...). 
Do it yourself.

Touching yourself during sex isn't masturbating with a peen inside of you. That's 
a common misconception that prevents women from getting everything they can 
out of sex. Clitoral arousal builds upon the pleasure from intercourse. It's like 
adding layers onto your orgasm. We mean, if cake is better with more layers 
then your O will be too.
