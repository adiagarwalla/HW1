t that killed 35 people.Authorities said the terrorists were planning to smuggle 
the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press. 
"They're always trying to accuse Georgia and its secret se
engine jet before lifting off, then quickly posting them as profile pictures 
on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and 
sent debris tumbling down the side of the mountain, leaving a giant 
earthy gash alon

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
 he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could
