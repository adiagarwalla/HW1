a long time," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday on 
Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy
ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and 
ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial 
in Baghdad.The Iraqi Interior M

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

 , the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha
t George Wallace and Lester Maddox, you know, I don't think they 
were advocating for urbancation in their time in office. So I 
think we have a pretty good distinction there," he said.Asked about Lewis' 
appearance in the city, Christie said: "Congressman Lewis is an American hero. 
Any time he wants to come to New Jersey, he will be 
welcomed with open arms. He led an extraordinary movement at great personal 
risk and sacrifice to himself."Christie said he would have cleared his calendar 
if Lewis had asked to meet with him.In a statement released Monday, 
Gusciora said the governor "constantly reverts to name-calling when he is unable 
to address issues on their merits.""The fact is the governor's opposition to 
the civil right of marriage equality is comparable to others who opposed 
other civil rights. If he doesn't like the comparison, then he should 
change his position on marriage equality and sign the bill into law," 
he said.Democrats have resurrected gay ma
