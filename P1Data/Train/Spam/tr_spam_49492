Police said two men died and 59 people were hurt in a 
predawn pileup of about 40 vehicles that closed heavily trafficked Interstate 10 
in eastern New Orleans through rush hour and beyond.Officer Garry Flot said 
22 people were taken to hospitals with minor to critical injuries, and 
another 37 refused treatment for minor injuries after the wrecks happened at 
about 4 a.m. on Thursday. He said a firefighter was injured while 
working at the scene.Flot said the crash took place on the westbound 
lanes heading toward the city's business district and involved a wide variety 
of vehicles.Both westbound and eastbound lanes were closed to permit emergency vehicles 
to access the area. Traffic was being detoured off the highway. It 
was unclear when I-10 will reopen.
