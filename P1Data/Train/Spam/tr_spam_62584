Lunges Sex Position
 The variation on Asian Cowgirl, the http://www.erc-nt.ru/Hawaiian Lunges position is basically the same with the receiver's front foot planted, but the rear leg is extended out behind them and between the giver's legs. The giver simply lays on their back with legs slightly open.
Although not overly difficult for the young and nimble, this position can be extremely difficult and tiring for many receivers, so their partner should offer some support using their hands whenever possible.
