he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put 
on the no-fly list a person must be on the larger terro
ers. All 45 people on board were feared dead.Due to the remoteness 
of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia 
as part of a six-nation tour of Asia aimed at drumming up 
new customers.It was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists 
on what was supposed to be a quick, 50-minute demonstration flight Wednesday.

the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level
