AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e

funding for Maricopa County.Arpaio has long denied the racial profiling allegations, saying 
people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they have 
committed crimes and that deputies later find many of them are illegal 
immigrants. He also said the decision by Homeland Security to sever ties 
will result in illegal immigrants being released from jail and large numbers.
