APJan. 31, 2012: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses a Security Council 
meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice --

APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

PHILADELPHIA  Retired Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who led the Roman Catholic Archdiocese 
of Philadelphia for more than 15 years, championing the Vatican line on 
homosexuality and abortion but later coming under fire by two grand juries 
investigating child sex abuse allegations, has died. He was 88.Bevilacqua died in 
his sleep Tuesday night at St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Wynnewood, a 
Philadelphia suburb, after battling dementia and an undisclosed form of cancer, an 
archdiocese spokeswoman said. He had been the spiritual leader of the 1.5 
million-member Archdiocese of Philadelphia from 1988 until his retirement in 2003.Bevilacqua, trained 
in both civil and canon lawyer, was sharply criticized but never charged 
by two Philadelphia grand juries investigating child sex abuse complaints lodged against 
dozens of priests in the archdiocese. His death comes just days after 
lawyers battled in court over his competency as a potential witness in 
the upcoming trial of

them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie

owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them
