to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more

Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are

a test program and waive us through (Baltimore has this in some 
terminals for example), but others are still struggling to implement it. For 
now, we must go through the same charades as passengers except it 
really is pointless for us.Do you ever hear qualms from passengers about 
your young age?Occasionally, we will hear people commenting that we look like 
kids. But, its really all relative and a matter of perspective. What 
we hear most often is people exclaiming how small the plane is 
or their reference to it as a puddle jumper. This, too, is 
relative and most often heard by infrequent flyers. Seasoned travelers know that 
as many as half of domestic flights today (if not more) are 
operated by regional jets. The flight decks on these aircraft are just 
as modern as mainline aircraft. In fact, most regional jets are fairly 
new from the past decade or so, and they can fly distances

d plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. "shows that 
some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether
