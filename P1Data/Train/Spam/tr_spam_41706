<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte
 e anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks in a breach that rattled U.S. foreign relations 
and, according to the government, imperiled valuable military and diplomatic sources. Defense 
attorneys argue the leaked material did little or no damage to U.S. 
interests.Fulton provided details of a confrontation that finally got Manning banned from 
the workplace. She said Spc. Jirhleah Showman grew angry after she was 
summoned from her bed to work, and saw Manning there, apparently playing 
a video game.Fulton said she heard Manning tell Showman to calm down. 
Fulton testified that she heard terse words exchanged, followed by shuffling sounds, 
and then saw Manning pinning Showman to the floor."She said he had 
struck her and she had a welt on her face," Fulton said.Another 
government witness, Sgt. Chad Madaras, testified that Manning was sometimes sullen and 
unresponsive, especially toward Adkins."He would sit down at his work station and 
kind of ignore everyone," Madaras said under
 rnment's Office of Civil Defense.In Iligan, a coastal industrial hub of 330,000 
people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died 
in Cagayan de Oro, most of them
