o oversee security operations.Although the demonstrating oil workers in Zhanaozen were fired 
by their employers over the summer, the protests have continued unabated.Kasymov said 
that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and 
the local branch of the governing Nur Otan party, Kasymov said.Kasymov said 
police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every 
police officer took the decision themselves. When they take a weapon off 
you, there is no need for an order to be issued," Kasymov 
said.He also insisted tha
aid the best way to "provide certainty for job creators, employees and 
the long-term unemployed is through regular order" -- a term used to

the differences," a McConnell aide added on Monday.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent

 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase
