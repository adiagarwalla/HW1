ng cuts.The House version of the legislation -- priced at more than 
$180 billion -- keeps the Social Security tax at 4.2 percent, extends 
unemployment benefits for 79 weeks -- rather than 99, and requires illegal 
drug testing and high school dropouts to get an equivalent to a 
GED. It also provides for the "doctor fix."In addition, the House legislation 
blocks an Environmental Protection Agency rule curbing pollution from industrial boilers and 
extends tax break for businesses buying equipment for 2012.Differences also lie in 
how to pay for the bill. The House bill wants to extend 
the current pay freeze on civilian federal workers for another year and 
requires them to contribute more toward their pensions; raises fee Fannie Mae 
and Freddie Mac charge for insuring mortgages; raises Medicare premiums paid by 
higher-income elderly; cuts some health care overhaul law programs; sells part of 
broadcast spectrum; prevents illegal immigrant parents from collecting child 
r the Cold War-era armed conflict ended in a cease-fire.Japanese Prime Minister 
Yoshihiko Noda held an emergency national security council with top Cabinet members 
soon after hearing the news.He "instructed us to be best prepared in 
case of any unexpected development" while top officials meet to discuss the 
situation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told journalists in Tokyo.Fujimura expressed condolences 
and said Japan hoped Kim's death would not affect the region adversely."First 
of all we hope that this sudden development would not give adverse 
impact on the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula," he said.The 
White House said it was in constant contact with South Korea and 
Japan, but offered no substantive comment on the implications of Kim's death, 
saying only that President Barack Obama "reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment 
to the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our 
close ally, the Republic of Korea."The news jo
omestic box-office record of $10.6 billion set in 2009, a mark that 
was nearly reached again in 2010.But with less than two weeks left 
and revenues lagging 4 percent behind last year's, that record is out 
of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was
 in the United States.The experts say they found the legal authority for 
EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera
SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous 
in photos and video from recent trips to China and Russia and 
in numerous trips around the country carefully documented by state media. The
