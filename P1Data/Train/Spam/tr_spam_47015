Subject: Cathal Embrey Teaspoons

Teaspoons
 http://www.ramvol.ru/diereses Teaspoons is similar to Bodyguard, but kneeling down. A rear-entry position with all the intensity of Doggy Style and with the connectivity of a side-by-side position. To get in this position, the receiver simply kneels in front and is penetrated from behind. This position is especially good in allowing the giving partner access to touch and caress the other's body, so make sure to keep those hands occupied!
The only difficult part of this might be in aligning the genitals; the easiest fix is a couch cushion or pillow.
