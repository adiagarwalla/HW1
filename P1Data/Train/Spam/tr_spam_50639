er members were upset with the union spending dues on non-union concerns."We're 
not happy," she said on Fox News. "When you pay dues, you 
think you're paying for a better work environment."SEUIs political action committee reported 
$70.4 billion in expenditures for the 2008 Obama campaign, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. And the union, which has 2.1 million members 
and is the fastest-growing union in North America, endorsed Obamas re-election campaign 
back in November 2011.SEIU will reportedly pay the rent for six months 
so Occupy protesters can plan demonstrations, workshops and continue to advocate for 
the 99 percent (of Americans) to have a say in returning the 
country to a just political and economic system.The union did not return 
a call to verify it is paying the rent.Occupy DC was essentially 
evicted in February from McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, 
for continuing to camp overnight on federal land. District officials ha

events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama has threatened to veto a Department of Justice appropriations 
bill House Republicans passed because, among other things, it includes a provision 
that blocks a gun control law his administration used Operation Fast and 
Furious to pass.The Obama administrations Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
wrote, and began implementing, a new rule that would require gun dealers 
in the four U.S. states that border Mexico to report sales of 
multiple semi-automatic rifles to the ATF.In the 2013 fiscal year budget for 
the Department of Justice and related agencies, House Republicans inserted a rider, 
or condition, that would force the ATF to not implement that rule.In 
a statement the White House released upon receiving the House appropriations bill,

that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops
