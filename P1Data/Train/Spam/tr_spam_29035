their baneful effects on the risinggeneration, for whose amusement it appea=

too little do we calculate on the direful effects of this species ofamuseme=

 you seethe new pantomime?"--"Yes." "Well, did you see any fun?"--"Yes, Ibe=

to teach them the art of pilfering to perfection, than to the theatre,when =
pantomimes are performed. To say that the persons who write andintroduce th=
ese pieces are in want of _sense_, may not be true; but Imust charge them w=
ith a want of sufficient thought, right feeling andprinciple, in not calcul=
ating on their baneful effects on the risinggeneration, for whose amusement=
 it appears they are chiefly produced.Many unfortunate persons, who have he=
ard sentence of death passed uponthem, or who are now suffering under the l=
aw, in various ways, havehad to lament that the _first seeds of vice were s=
own in their mindswhile viewing the pilfering tricks of clowns in pantomime=
s_. Alas!too little do we calculate on the direful effects of this species =
ofamusement on the future character of the young. We first permit theirmind=
s to be poisoned, by offering them the draught, and then punishthem by law =
for taking it. Does not the wide world afford a varietyof materials suffici=
ent for virtuous imitation, without descending tothat which is vicious? It =
is much easier to make a pail of pure waterfoul, than it is to make a pail =
of foul water pure. It must not besupposed that I wish to sweep off every k=
ind of amusement from thejuvenile part of society, but I do wish to sweep o=
ff all that has apernicious tendency. The limits which I have prescribed to=
 myself willnot allow me to enter more at large into this subject; otherwis=
eI could produce a number of facts which would prove, mostunquestionably, t=
he propriety of discontinuing these exhibitions.A conversation which I once=
 heard between some boys who were playingat what is called _pitch-in-the-ho=
le_, will prove the truth of myassertions. "Bill," said one of the boys to =
the other, "when did yougo to the play last?" "On Monday night," was the re=
ply. "Did you seethe new pantomime?"--"Yes." "Well, did you see any fun?"--=
"Yes, Ibelieve I did too. I saw the clown _bone_ a whole _hank_ of sausages=
,and put them into his pocket, and then pour the gravy in after them.You wo=
uld have split your sides with laughing, had you been there.A.B. and C.D. w=
ere with me, and they laughed as much as I did.And what do you think A.B. d=
id the next night?"--"How should Iknow."--"Why," replied the other, "he and=
 C.D. _boned_ about twopounds of sausages from a pork shop, and we had them=
 for supper." Thisconversation I heard from a window, which looked into a r=
uinous placewhere boys assembled to toss up for money, and other games. Thi=
s factalone, without recording any more, is sufficient to show the evil ofw=
hich I have been speaking. And I do most sincerely hope that those
