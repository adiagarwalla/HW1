d, especially the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The company's global sales climbed 
22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a
APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Korea has repeatedly pressed for the resumption of those nuclear talks, but 
Washington and Seoul have said Pyongyang must first follow through on previous 
nuclear commitments.Campbell urged China, North Korea's only major economic and political backer, 
to share more of its plans concerning North Korea with Washington and 
Seoul.Japan's Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported this week that China 
decided to provide 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of oil 
to North Korea in a move meant to help stabilize Kim Jong 
Un's leadership.Campbell said the United States believes Chinese officials have "taken steps 
to underscore their commitment to the transition in power in North Korea. 
Those steps might include further provision of assistance, given the circumstances in 
North Korea." He didn't elaborate.North Korea regularly criticizes South Korean President Lee 
Myung-bak and says it won't work with him. South Korea has cut 
off large-scale offici
 et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser
President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
