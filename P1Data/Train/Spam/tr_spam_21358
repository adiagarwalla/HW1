      Your doctor has probably told you fish oil is great for heart health.<br>
      <br>
      But they probably didn’t tell you, because they don’t know, that<br>
      fish oil can be VERY dangerous.<br>
      <br>
      Many fish oils are made with toxic farmed fish that live and grow<br>
      in their own feces.<br>
      <br>
      Others have mercury contamination.<br>
      <br>
      Most all of them give you disgusting “fish burps.”<br>
      <br>
      Fortunately, for those of us deathly <a href="http://notformom.com/36rz8176y1"><strong><u>
		afraid of having a heart attack</u></strong></a>,<br>
      <br>
      there’s something pure from the most remote regions of earth that<br>
      is WAY more powerful than fish oil.<br>
      <br>
      In fact, the fish oil companies stand to lose BILLIONS because of this<br>
      secret nutrient I’m about to reveal.<br>
