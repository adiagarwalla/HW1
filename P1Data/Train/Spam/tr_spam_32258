NEW YORK  U.S. stock futures are getting a boost from solid 
manufacturing data from around the world as attention turns toward the state 
of the U.S. economy in the run-up to a crucial jobs report.Dow 
futures are up 94 points at 12,671, while the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 futures are up 10 points at 1,318. The Nasdaq composite 
is up 14 points at 2,478.Figures released Wednesday show that China's manufacturing 
sector is growing steadily and Europe's is performing better than forecast. That 
gives investors hope that U.S. manufacturing figures will show the world's largest 
economy continues its recovery.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due 
to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory 
output likely grew at a faster rate in January after businesses spent 
more on industrial machinery, airplanes and other equipment.Investors will also focus on 
the monthly hiring figures from private payrolls agency ADP, which 
ent will remain at 7 percent or above through 2015The new figures 
also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand 
bargain" on the deficit, an effort that got hung up over taxes 
and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What
JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and 
 ReutersFILE 2009: Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki gestures during talks with his 
Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazif in Cairo.BAGHDAD  Iraq's parliament reconvened Tuesday after 
Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian 
political fight has been accompanied by a surge in violence, killing more 
than 200 people this month and raising fears of a civil war.Iraqiya 
leaders lifted the parliament ban on Sunday, and m
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the

78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to
