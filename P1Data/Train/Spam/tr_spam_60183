APJan. 31, 2012: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton addresses a Security Council 
meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice -- 
"stan
ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force 
must now review the OSC report and promptly take appropriate action."Air Force 
Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and 
counter to Air Force core values."In an earlier investigation report released in 
November, OSC officials said they had found "gross mismanagement" at the Dover 
facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki

alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat
