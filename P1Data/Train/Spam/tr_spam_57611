But until tonight I had not tried his new place, which has apparently garnered its own legion of fans (if Yelp is any indication).  My Mom had been here a number of times and is a passionately devoted fan of the restaurant.  So we decided to dine together so she could show me what I've been missing.

The restaurant is tucked in amidst a huge shopping center 10524400 on Tatum & Shea, just a stones throw from Paradise Valley Mall.  When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with an atmosphere and a look of a restaurant that is refined, but also casual.  There's a nice bar as well as some patio seating up front.  Towards the back you walk past a nice fireplace and a decent assortment of wines on the wall.  We got a reservation for two, but there was plenty of seating on Sunday that we really didn't need it.  Almost as if psychic, our host knew my Mom easily gets cold and sat us next to the fireplace.

The menu changes with whats in season 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 as Chef Rusconi apparently makes a point of it to source as much of his ingredients locally as possible.  Prior to arriving, I had my heart set on one dish in particular.  The beef tenderloin medallions with mac & cheese.  But before I could order, the waiter reminded me that night was beef short rib night.  Suddenly the gameplan changed.  10524400 I got the beef short rib with spaetzle, carrots, and green beans dressed in an au jus.  For an appetizer beforehand I got their white truffle mac n cheese so I could get my mac n cheese fix.  

The mac n cheese was served hot in a little pot and was delicious.  Super creamy, noodles were cooked perfectly, and the portion was perfect for sharing.  The short ribs were also good, though I wouldn't say its the best short rib I've had.  It was a little tougher and not as tender as short ribs I've had at places like Beckett's Table and Crudo.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
