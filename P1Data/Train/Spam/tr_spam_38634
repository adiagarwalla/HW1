your mouth". A MUST GO! As a celebratory lunch for being alive after a near death experience by crazy valet driver in front of 8305086 Mirage, we decided to have Bobby Flay grace us with his delicious Tex-Mex creations. Living it up in true Vegas style, margaritas were in order. Ultimate = a simple original favorite. White peach = excellent and refreshing. Pear = way too strong, and why was it hot pink? Everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. 8305086 contemporary decor, 8305086 presentation of each dish, and even 8305086 drinks. Bobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. 8305086 habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. 8305086 duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind.
