BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t
Tom Cruise is back with the slickest adventure-travel guide of the year: 
Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol. Boasting an exotic trip around the world, 
an engaging script, funny dialogue and spectacular stunts, Ghost Protocol is an 
adrenaline-rush adventure on a grand scale.The latest installment in the "Mission: Impossible" 
franchise forces Ethan Hunt and his team to go rogue after being 
framed for bombing the Kremlin. To clear their names they travel from 
Russia to Dubai to Mumbai tracking the maniacal Russian heavy whos intent 
on instigating global nuclear war.Ghost Protocol has a healthy mix of stealthy 
intrigue and urgency, combining the successful espionage elements of the original with 
a frenetic larger-than-life adventure featuring several jaw-dropping set pieces. The highlight is 
a breathtaking spider crawl up Dubais Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in 
the world.Bravo to Cruise for doing his own stunts.Along for the ride 
again is Simon Pegg as Benji, 
 police. It was unclear how many protesters remain in military police 
custody.On his Twitter account, leading reform figure and Nobel Peace Prize winner 
Mohamed ElBaradei condemned the violence."If the sit-in broke the law, isn't the 
cruelty and brutality used to break it up a greater violation of 
all human rights laws? This is not how nations are managed," he 
wrote.The military took over after longtime President Hosni Mubarak was ousted in 
a popular revolt in February. Rights groups and activists charge that the 
military is carrying on the practices of the old regime, including arresting 
and beating dissidents.Protesters at the Cabinet building said the clashes began Thursday 
evening after soldiers severely beat a young man who was taking part 
in the sit-in.Hundreds of people rushed to join the protest after online 
video and photos showed people carrying the wounded man. The pictures showed 
his face and eyes bruised and swollen, his head wrapped in gauze 
and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">IRWINDALE, Calif.  Police said three are dead, including the suspected shooter, 
in California office attack.A gunman stormed into an office of the Southern 
California Edison utility Friday and shot a man and woman before killing 
himself, police said.The building was quickly locked down and dozens of people 
were seen streaming out with their hands raised. Two nearby schools also 
were locked down but no one on the campuses was hurt."One male 
gunman shot one female, one male and then apparently took his own 
life," Police Chief Dennis Smith told reporters.The conditions of the two people 
he wounded were not immediately known. There was also no immediate word 
on what prompted the gunfire.The utility company office is in a complex 
of buildings that also includes a business called California Lighting Sales.Cindy Gutierrez, 
the controller for that business, said employees there didn't hear any shots 
fired and didn't realize anything was amiss until building management a
 AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
