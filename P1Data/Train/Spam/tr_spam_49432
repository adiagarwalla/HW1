 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
(AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his 
late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said 
at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic."He made 
a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights 
and run several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, 
my day is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement 
after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work 
that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the 
second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn 
and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted 
Bevilacqua's leadership.Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the 
priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took

 rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f
KABUL, Afghanistan  The international military coalition in Afghanistan says a man 
wearing an Afghan army uniform has shot and killed a NATO service 
member.Tuesday's killing in southern Afghanistan is the latest in a rising number 
of cases in which an Afghan soldier or a militant dressed as 
one has turned his weapon against foreign troops.NATO did not provide any 
other details.After an Afghan soldier killed four French soldiers on Jan. 20, 
French President Nicolas Sarkozy announced France would speed up its exit and 
ask NATO to hand over all combat operations to Afghan forces in 
2013 instead of by the end of 2014.The Pentagon says that while 
the number of cases of Afghans killing their international partners is rising, 
it does not appear to be a widespread problem.
