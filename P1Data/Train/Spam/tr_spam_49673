he Tennessean.The Tennessee Office of Vital Records does not have a divorce 
on record, The Tennessean reports.But The Tennesean has the April 22 wedding 
announcement all right, which states John and Tricianne Taylor were married on 
January 14.Cowboy boots and yellow roses accented the ambiance of the couples 
Texas heritage. The groom wore a white linen suit accented with a 
gold Parthenon tie, gift from the bride," it reads.Mary Witherspoon also says 
in court documents that she confronted Taylor, but that she refused to 
speak to her or respond to a letter in which Mary informed 
her John was still married.Mary Witherspoon also alleges Taylor is trying to 
borrow money as Ms. John Witherspoon, has gotten John to change his 
will, and is living in a condo owned by Reese, the report 
says.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t
 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">mptive move, the committee backed an amendment by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., 
prohibiting any spending on implementing an international agreement on activities in space 
unless the pact has been ratified by the Senate or authorized by 
law.The idea of another round of domestic base closings lost by a 
44-18 vote. Lawmakers have challenged the savings from previous closings. Defense Secretary 
Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal 
and "actively rebuilds the military within the constrained resources available to us."Smith 
said he was pleased that the bill includes new conditions on providing 
aid to Pakistan. "It is imperative that Pakistan support our counterterrorism efforts," 
he said.Election-year maneuvering over the size of the Pentagon budget is unf

characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t
