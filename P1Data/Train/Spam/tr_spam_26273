sidered illegal.Peace talks with the Palestinians stalled more than three years ago, 
largely over continued Israeli settlement construction. With Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze, 
a recent round of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Jordan 
has yielded no breakthroughs.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is under intense international pressure 
to stay at the negotiating table. A final decision is expected after 
Abbas consults with Arab League officials over the weekend. The Palestine Liberation 
Organization discussed the issue on Monday but stopped short of urging Abbas 
to halt the contacts.Israel has said it wants to keep talking.Also Tuesday, 
Israeli authorities said they have received permission to force feed a Palestinian 
prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for more than six 
weeks.Prisons spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said 33-year-old Khader Adnan would not be force 
fed until "medical conditions" warranted it, but provided no further
of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights and run 
several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, my day 
is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement after turning 
80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work that year. 
Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the second grand 
jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn and four 
others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted Bevilacqua's leadership.Prosecutors 
said last year that not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."Lynn was the first U.S. 
church official ever charged in the priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. 
His lawyers argue that he took orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is 
scled to start in March.Bevilacqua had been deposed in late November to
e manufactured by Pfizer and marketed by Akrimax Pharmaceuticals and shipped to 
warehouses, clinics and retail pharmacies nationwide, the company said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> and wounded four others. The base is in Kandahar Province in 
southern Afghanistan, and lawmakers have been demanding details about the incident."The insider 
threat is an issue of increasing significance to coalition forces and Afghan 
National Security Forces operating in Afghanistan," the defense officials said. "It creates 
distrust between our forces and their Afghan counterparts during a critical juncture 
in Afghanistan."Among the officials scled to present the data to the committee 
are Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary David Sedney and Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, 
who is the Pentagon's director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan coordination group.While there have 
been some instances of insurgents secretly joining the Afghan security forces, officials 
said it is difficult to determine how often that has happened because 
the infiltrator often remains undetected. Insurgents can easily disguise themselves as Afghan 
security forces and have been doing so more often
 WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for

FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents
