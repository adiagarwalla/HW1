<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">What a find! Me and the girlfriend were needed to stop in for a quick dinner on a Friday night (she may have beat me to it on the review...). 1733664 We figured we would stop in and give Chop Shop a try based on some other yelp reviews, plus despite being off the beaten path slightly its located in an easily accessible location right on Colfax. I've noticed this location more than a few times driving past on Colfax, its notable with the neat marquee style light bulbs.

The interior ambience is great, and the concept is unique. 1733664 Walking in you order from a counter, there are screen based menus, which are clear and easy to read, both above the ordering counter and in line as well. They have a limited selection of beer and some mixed drinks (but they had one of my favorite beers on tap, Avery White Rascal). All of the options here were very reasonably priced, from drinks to food.

The food was incredible. 51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b I had the Top Sirloin over a bed of potatoes and onions. The meat was covered in a light chimichurri sauce and the potatoes had an intriguing sauce that was indescribable but delicious. The meals were plated on wood chopping boards which had Chop Shop burned into them, really neat presentation, and the actual plating was excellent. My two hesitations about giving Chop Shop a 5th star were due to the food. 1733664 I ordered mine cooked medium and felt that it was cooked slightly past the point where I would consider medium, however this was very minor to me, it was not overcooked by any definition. I choose not to send it back but I felt a place specializing in steak should hit the nail on the head every time for cooking steak. My second minor qualm was the portion size. I ordered just an entree off the menu and wasn't quite filled up by it, in the future I'll order a side as well such as fries or a bowl of soup. For lunch it would have been fine, but for dinner I suggest if you have a hearty appetite you order something alongside your entree.

I can't wait to go back however, 1733664 the menu options are numerous and many were intriguing. The girl at the counter did note that many options change with the seasonal availability of ingredients which I really liked, I am looking forward to many more meals here in the future!
