Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But 13179182 tender meat and complex sauce compensated for 13179182 overly sweet bite. NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By 13179182 time 13179182 grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of 13179182 sweet dishes. But in fairness 13179182 "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, 13179182 sweet provides a gentle method for accepting 13179182 kick in many of 13179182 dishes.  There is a purpose behind 13179182 flavor selections. I appreciate 13179182 thoughtfulness behind 13179182 dishes.  What more could I ask? CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light. PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected. VERDICT: This was a lovely meal.
