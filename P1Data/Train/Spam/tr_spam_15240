percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate

that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.

weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJanuary 31, 2012: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kurt Campbell delivers a 
speech during a dinner hosted by the Korea Society in Seoul, South 
Korea. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia is reassuring South Korea 
that any diplomatic dealings with North Korea will be backed up by 
an unwavering U.S.-South Korea military presence.SEOUL, South Korea  In a message 
aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, 
were a signal to North Korea's new government that Washington is ready 
to talk after weeks of transition and uncertainty following the Dec. 17 
death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il.But Campbell also looked to reassure 
worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as 
South Korea is
 NEW YORK  U.S. stock futures are getting a boost from solid 
manufacturing data from around the world as attention turns toward the state 
of the U.S. economy in the run-up to a crucial jobs report.Dow 
futures are up 94 points at 12,671, while the broader Standard &amp; 
Poor's 500 futures are up 10 points at 1,318. The Nasdaq composite 
is up 14 points at 2,478.Figures released Wednesday show that China's manufacturing 
sector is growing steadily and Europe's is performing better than forecast. That 
gives investors hope that U.S. manufacturing figures will show the world's largest 
economy continues its recovery.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due 
to be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory 
output likely grew at a faster rate in January after businesses spent 
more on industrial machinery, airplanes and other equipment.Investors will also focus on 
the monthly hiring figures from private payrolls agency ADP, which 
creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers
