<p style="font-size:xx-small;">A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

  Sharyl Attkisson reported in December. That would require some U.S. gun 
shops to report the sale of multiple rifles or long guns. Demand 
Letter 3 was so-named because it would be the third ATF program 
demanding gun dealers report tracing information. (VIDEO: Chaffetz to Dems on Fast 
and Furious: Have guts to take on Holder)Democratic politicians have also invoked 
Fast and Furious when pushing for stricter gun control laws. During an 
early November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
tried to leverage the crisis to push for anti-gun regulations.My concern, Mr. 
Chairman, is theres been a lot said about Fast and Furious, and 
perhaps mistakes were made, but I think this hunt for blame doesnt 
really speak about the problem, Feinstein said during a Nov. 1 hearing. 
And the problem is, anybody can walk in and buy anything: .50-caliber 
weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts and send them down 
to Mexico. So,
 t that killed 35 people.Authorities said the terrorists were planning to smuggle 
the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press.
