EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a

Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
ong independents. Obama receives 45 percent of non-aligned adults compared with 41 
percent for Romney. Against Gingrich, Obama holds a wide lead among independents, 
with 54 percent supporting the president and 31 percent backing the former 
Georgia congressman.Another piece of good news for Obama: people generally like him 
personally. Obama's personal favorability rating held steady at 53 percent, with 46 
percent viewing him unfavorably. About three-quarters called him likable.The economy remains a 
source of pessimism, though the poll suggests the first positive movement in 
public opinion on the economy in months. One in five said the 
economy improved in the last month, double the share saying so in 
October. Still most expect it to stay the same or get worse.The

Affairs and Corporate Communications. It involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,000

Europe since WWII, but sometimes people forget the terrible violence that happened

still brewing in parts of the world today, and we all cant 
keep turning a blind eye.These themes are universal, we need to understand 
that there are places bubbling up now that we need to prevent, 
we need to reflect on the past and understand what weve learned,

cried for him," said villager Huang Hancan. "He must have suffered from 
mistreatment for a good healthy man to turn into a dead man 
just a day after being detained. No doubt, he was beaten to 
death and everyone can imagine that."In an interview this week with Hong 
Kong online magazine iSun Affairs, Xue Jinbo's daughter said his body showed 
signs of bruising and swelling on his mouth, hands, neck and elsewhere, 
as well as open wounds on his forehead and jaw."When we looked 
at his back, there were also many bruises that look like he 
had been kicked or stamped on," she said in a video posted 
on the magazine's website.Calls to the offices of the Communist Party propaganda 
department and the government of Shanwei city, which oversees Wukan, rang unanswered 
Friday. Chinese media reported that local authorities said Xue died of cardiac

their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was," said Robert 
Khuzami, SEC's enforcement director."These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute 
investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the 
market about the amount of risk."Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about 
half of U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million loans.The Bush administration seized
