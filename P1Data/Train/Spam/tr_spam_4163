produces 5 million barrels of oil each day and consumes 20 million 
gallons a day of refined oil."The U.S. is by far the largest 
consumer of refined products on the planet," he said. "It is natural 
that the vast majority of this product will stay in the region 
with the highest demand."Girling acknowledged that after last year's oil spills in 
the Gulf of Mexico and Michigan's Kalamazoo River, the public has grown 
distrustful of companies that produce and transport oil. He said TransCanada and 
the entire industry need to improve communication with the public.Project opponents have 
"created this perception that we were going to poison drinking and irrigation

a very sensitive issue for some people. If someone said to me 
that this was going to be contaminating my water, I'd be concerned 
as well."

took photographs of as many as 14 young girls while they were 
changing in her classroom and at her home and shared them with 
Doby. Crain also is accused of setting up video chats on her 
school computer between her students and a man named "Uncle G," who 
authorities say was Doby."Any person who has a child that's been a 
student of Mrs. Crain has been on pins and needles wondering if
