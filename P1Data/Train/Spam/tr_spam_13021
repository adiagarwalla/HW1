scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you

the West Bank that qualify for housing subsidies. The incentives, according to 
a statement from the prime minister's office, are "meant to encourage positive 
migration to these communities."The list of qualifying settlements include major enclaves that 
would likely remain in Israeli hands under a peace deal. But most 
are located deep inside the West Bank and likely would have to 
be dismantled.In a separate move, the government on Monday appointed a committee 
to examine land ownership issues in the West Bank.The panel will review 
a 2005 government report that found several dozen outposts were built not 
only without state approval, but on privately held Palestinian land. Officials said 
the report needs to be reviewed because its author, state prosecutor Talia
