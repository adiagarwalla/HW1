Wise Investor trudieandfrankie@fs.net,

I've realized there are glearing warning signals for an "inevitable market crash." There is a 70 percent chance it's coming - and it will bring on a 25-year depression.

Colleagues at the CIA are getting ready for a meltdown in the wake of this trillion-dollar-crisis.  I want you to be prepared. 

I'd like to rush you a complimentary copy of my book, The Death of Money, which will 
include the controversial unpublished chapter, and will prepare you for this financial upheaval.  

A massive depression is coming. Go here to protect yourself while you still can

My first thoughts of The Porch, awesome. 24341192 We came for lunch on a Saturday, and the place was already heavily packed. The whole place gave me a good vibe and great ambiance. 

We walked in and were greeted right away, 24341192 and even though the place was pretty busy we got seated right away and had immediate service. We had our drinks in no time and service was prompt. 

I had onion rings and the chicken avocado BLT.  The food came out quick and he onion rings were hot and fresh. They were perfectly fried and flavorful. The chicken sandwich was just as good, the chicken was juicy and delicious. The whole meal was wonderful. The table next to us had ordered the fried chicken Cobb salad, that looked so decadent!3ea0e5d93dac9ffb3e4aa4f8a5ba52fa
