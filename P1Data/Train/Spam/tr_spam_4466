URGENT: Read Banned Fox News Story Here - Document #8777786
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Release Date:  January 19, 2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Status: BANNED


This major scandal has broken.
 
We believe there to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest U.S. food producers.
 
This story is so controversial, Fox News banned it from being aired... they also fired the two covering reporters.
 
If you support the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH Obama after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down?

This is your warning from me - what you are about to watch may make you sick to your stomach.

Mr. Doug Hill,
Director of The Laissez-Faire-Club

I met girlfriends here for dinner. 18513788 We ordered a little bit of everything and sampled not one but three desserts. Everything was delicious!! 
We started with the beef carpaccio snd pomme frites. 18513788 I loved the fried pickles on the carpaccio and the pomme frites were better than expected. Like several other reviews have mentioned...make sure you get an order! 
For our meal, we decided on the Parmesan gnocchi, 5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013 Garganeili and Pork carnitas. Each one was excellent but my favorites of the night were the Garganeili with the house made Italian sausage which was packed with so much flavor...and the pork carnitas with the pickled cabbage and queso fresco!!! Yummy!!!
For dessert we ordered the pot de creme 18513788 (chocolate and expresso custard), the apple cobbler and the chocolate brownie with biscoff ice cream....all were so darn good!!! But my goodness that biscoff ice cream was heavenly.  Such a cool place, with excellent food. I look forward to my next visit.5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013
