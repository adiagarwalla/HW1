NB: THE INSURANCE FEE (US$150:00) IS ABSOLUTELY COMPULSORY, AND MUST BEPAID BEFORE THE SHIPMENT OF YOUR PARCEL WHILE THE MAILING FEE SHOULD BEPAID TO THE DELIVERY AGENT THAT WILL DELIVER YOUR PARCEL TO YOUR DOORSTEP). 

Due to the diplomatic content of your parcel, it will be illegal to send it without being insured as it will violate the federal deliveryrules governing diplomatic parcel delivery. This means payment for the insurance fee must be made before the parcel is sent to avoid risk. 

This is because of some bad experience we had in the past. 

We can not afford to re-issue your cheque if anything goes wrong. In this case payment for the insurance fee is absolutely compulsory, while the mailing fee should be paid to any of the above listed delivery company you choose at the point of delivery. Your prize is protected by a hardcover insurance policy, which makes it impossible to ct any amount from the money before remittance. 

This means that the above insurance charges cannot be cted from the prize and hence must be provided by you before your parcel is shipped. 

This is in accordance with section 13(1)(n) of the international gambling act as adopted in 1993 and amended on 3RD july 1996 by the constitutional assembly. This is to protect receipients and to avoid misappropriation of funds. fill the  information bellow;
