should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.

rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of

Arpaio's office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, 
including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic 
Constitutional rights. "We found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the 
culture of the department, a culture that breeds a systematic disregard for 
basic constitutional protections," said Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division.The report will be used by the Justice Department to seek 
major changes at Arpaio's office, such as new policies against discrimination and 
improvements of staff and officers. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for 
saying whether he wants to work out an agreement to make the
