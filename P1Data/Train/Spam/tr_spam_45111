The Proposal - kamasutra sex position

The Proposal sex position takes a bit of practice and good aim!

Kneeling face-to-face, he puts his left foot flat on the ground front of him (like 
he's proposing) http://www.pr-lab.dk/turquoise and she puts her right foot on the ground and nudges closer. 

Penetration can be made by leaning forward towards the planted feet, lunging 
back and forth creates a slow, upright romp.
