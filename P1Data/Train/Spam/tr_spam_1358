In Weigler's process a bath is prepared by passing washed chlorine gas into =
a concentrated aqueous solution of stannous chloride to saturation, and expe=
lling excess of gas by warming the solution, which is then diluted with abou=
t ten volumes of water, and filtered, if necessary. The articles to be plate=
d are pickled in dilute sulphuric acid, and polished with fine sand and a sc=
ratch-brush, rinsed in water, loosely wound round with zinc wire or tape, an=
d immersed in the bath for ten or fifteen minutes at ordinary temperatures. =
The coating is finished with the scratch-brush and whiting. By this process =
cast-or wrought-iron, steel, copper, brass, and lead can be tinned without a=
 separate battery. The only disadvantage of the process is that the bath soo=
n becomes clogged up with zinc chloride, and the tin salt must be frequently=
 removed. In Hern's process a bath composed of=FF=FF
Tartaric acid    2    oz.
Water    100     "
Soda    3     "
Protochloride of tin    3     "

is employed instead of the preceding. It requires a somewhat longer exposure=
 to properly tin articles in this than in Weigler's bath. Either of these ba=
ths may be used with a separate battery.
SECTION VII.
GALVANIZING.

Galvanizing, as a protecting surface for large articles, such as enter into =
the construction of bridges, roofs, and shipwork, has not quite reached the =
point of appreciation that possibly the near future may award to it. Certain=
 fallacies existed for a long time as to the relative merits of the dry or m=
olten and the wet or electrolytical methods of galvanizing. The latter was f=
ound to be costly and slow, and the results obtained were erratic and not sa=
tisfactory, and soon gave place to the dry or molten bath process, as in pra=
ctice at the present day; but the difficulty of management in connexion with=
 large baths of molten material, and the deterioration of the bath, and othe=
r mechanical causes, limit the process to articles of comparatively small si=
ze and weight. The electro deposition of zinc has been subject to many paten=
ts, and the efforts to introduce it have been lamentable in both a mechanica=
l and financial sense. Most authorities recommend a current density of 18 or=
 20 amp=FF=FF=FF=FFres per square foot of cathode surface, and aqueous solut=
ions of zinc sulphate, acetate or chloride, ammonia, chloride or tartrate, a=
s being the most suitable for deposition. Electrolytes made by adding causti=
c potash or soda to a suitable zinc salt have been found to be unworkable in=
 practice on account of the formation of an insoluble zinc oxide on the surf=
ace of the anode and the resultant increased electrical resistance; the elec=
trolytes are also constantly getting out of order, as more metal is taken ou=
t of the solution than could possibly be dissolved from the anodes by the ch=
emicals set free on account of this insoluble scale or furring up of the ano=
des, which sometimes reaches one-eighth of an inch in thickness. To all inte=
nts and purposes the deposits obtained from acid solutions under favourable =
circumstances are fairly adhesive when great care has been exercised to thor=
oughly scale and clean the surface to be coated, which is found to be the pr=
incipal difficulty in the application of any electro-chemical process for co=
pper, lead, or tin, as well as for zinc, and that renders even the applicati=
on of paint or other brush compounds to futile unless honestly complied with=
. Unfortunately these acid zinc coatings are of a transitory nature, Their =
durability being incomparable with hot galvanizing, as the deposit is porous=
 and retains some of the acid salts, which cause a wasting of the zinc, and =
consequently the rusting of the iron or steel. Castings coated with acid zin=
c rust comparatively quickly, even when the porosity has been ced by oxi=
dation, aggravated no doubt by some of the corroding agents=FF=FFsal-ammonia=
c, for instance=FF=FFbeing forced into the pores of the metal. Other matters=
 of serious moment in the electro-zincing process, apart from the slowness o=
f the operation, were the uncertain nature, thickness, and extent of the coa=
ting on articles of irregular shape, and the formation of loose, dark-colour=
ed patches on the work; the unhealthy and non-metallic look and want of bril=
liancy and the lustre prevented engineers and the trade from accepting the p=
rocess or its results, except for the commoner articles of use. To obviate a=
ny tendency of the paint to peel off from the zinc surface, as it generally =
manifests a disposition to do, it is recommended to coat all the zinc surfac=
es, previous to painting them, with the following compound: 1 part chloride =
of copper, 1 part nitrate of copper, 1 part sal-ammoniac, dissolved in 61 pa=
rts of water, and then add 1 part commercial hydrochloric acid. When the zin=
c is brushed over with this mixture it oxidizes the surface, turns black, an=
d dries in from twelve to twenty-four hours, and may then be painted over wi=
thout any danger of peeling. Another and more quickly applied coating consis=
ts of, bi-chloride of platinum, 1 part dissolved in 10 parts of distilled wa=
ter, and applied either by a brush or sponge. It oxidizes at once, turns bla=
ck, and resists the weak acids, rain, and the elements generally.

Zinc surfaces, after a brief exposure to the air, become coated with a thin =
film of oxide=FF=FFinsoluble in water=FF=FFwhich adheres tenaciously, formin=
g a protective coating to the underlying zinc. So long as the zinc surface r=
emains intact, the underlying metal is protected from corrosive action, but =
a mechanical or other injury to the zinc coating that exposes the metal bene=
ath, in the presence of moisture causes a very rapid corrosion to be started=
, the galvanic action being changed from the zinc positive to zinc negative,=
 and the iron, as the positive element in the circuit, is corroded instead o=
f the zinc. When galvanized iron is immersed in a corrosive liquid, the zinc=
 is attacked in preference to the iron, provided both the exposed parts of t=
he iron and the protected parts are immersed in the liquid. The zinc has not=
 the same protective quality when the liquid is sprinkled over the surface a=
nd remains in isolated drops. Sea air, being charged with saline matters, is=
 very destructive to galvanized surfaces, forming a soluble chloride by its =
action. As zinc is one of the metals most readily attacked by acids, ordinar=
y galvanized iron is not suitable for positions where it is to be much expos=
ed to an atmosphere charged with acids sent into the air by some manufactori=
es, or to the sulphuric acid fumes found in the products of combustion of ro=
lling mills, iron, glass, and gas works, etc., and yet we see engineers of n=
ote covering-in important buildings with corrugated and other sheets of iron=
, and using galvanized iron tie rods, angles, and other constructive shapes =
in blind confidence of the protective power of the zinc coating; also in sup=
reme indifference as to the future consequences and catastrophes that arise =
from their unexpected failure. The comparative inertia of lead to the chemic=
al action of many acids has led to the contention that it should form as goo=
d, if not a better, protection of iron than zinc, but in practice it is foun=
d to be deficient as a protective coating against corrosion. A piece of lead=
-coated iron placed in water will show decided evidences of corrosion in twe=
nty-four hours. This is to be attributed to the porous nature of the coating=
, whether it is applied by the hot or wet (acid) process. The lead does not =
bond to the plate as well as either of the other metals=FF=FFzinc, tin, copp=
er, or any alloys of them. The following table gives the increase in weight =
of different articles due to hot galvanizing:=FF=FF
