 compelling a decision within an unreasonably short timetable."All they did was 
shorten the review process," one senior administration official said.White House Communications Director 
Dan Pfeiffer offered a blunt warning earlier this week that the GOP 
was endangering the entire project."How will the GOP explain to their members 
that their bill doesn't force the President to approve Keystone, it essentially 
kills it?" he said on Twitter.In another tweet, he wrote: "The House 
bill simply shortens the review process in a way that virtually guarantees 
that the pipeline will NOT be approved."At the same time, Democrats struggled 
to explain why they were so vehemently opposed to the Keystone provision 
just days ago. Obama stated last week that he would reject any 
effort to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut bill.White House officials 
said Saturday that Obama was referring to any effort to force approval 
of the project, but that the president can accept a bill that l
y was low, generally and amongst her reality starring cohorts.Kims positive Q 
score is a 12 and her negative is a whopping 53. The 
average in the reality television category is a positive score of 18 
and a negative of 32.When you look at Kim and Kanye together 
you see that the audience does not favor either of them, Levitt 
said. For the most part they turn off the general audience."Even the 
tabloid magazines, who typically love celebrity couplings, say they dont want to 
see a West-Kardashian union.Right now Kim needs to focus on repairing her 
image and winning back the public's approval and their trust in her. 
Kanye West is a horrible choice. Those two would be the most 
hated couple in America if they started dating, explains In Touch Senior 
Editor Dorothy Cascerceri. He's extremely outspoken to the point of self-absorbed and 
conceited in the eyes of many. She needs to go with someone 
who the public already loves.Qualitatively and quantitatively Kim and Kanye 
 heights.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDecember 13, 2011: Jerry Sandusky, the former Penn State assistant football coach 
charged with sexually abusing boys, leaves the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, 
Pa.STATE COLLEGE, Pa.  Former board members of Jerry Sandusky's charity say 
its CEO never told them about a 2002 shower incident that is 
the focus of child sexual abuse charges against the retired Penn State 
assistant coach. If they knew Sandusky had been banned from bringing kids 
on campus, they say they could have taken steps to better protect 
children a decade ago."Not one thing was said to us," said Bradley 
P. Lunsford, a Centre County judge who served on the Second Mile 
board between 2001 and 2005. "Not a damn thing."If more information had 
been given to board members, they "would have asked the follow-up question: 
Why? You don't know? Who knows? Who can we talk to? Has 
this been reported to the police?" Lunsford said. "I guarantee you there 
would have been a competition among all those 
 ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
t the police did not shoot to kill, but fired in the 
air or in the ground, and that some people may have been 
fatally struck by ricocheting bullets. Kasymov conceded, however, that the police force 
would have to put in place better contingency planning for the deployment 
of nonlethal crowd control techniques.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
chairperson-in-office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, expressed his concern in a statement 
at the measures adopted in suppressing the disorder."Any action to control crowds 
by law enforcement should be proportionate and in line with international human 
rights standards," he said.Rights activists will likely also be concerned by what 
appeared to heavy-handed treatment of detainees at Zhanaozen's main police station Sunday 
evening. Journalists at the station reported hearing screams coming from what appeared 
to be interrogation rooms, while a number of men with bloodied faces 
were lined u
