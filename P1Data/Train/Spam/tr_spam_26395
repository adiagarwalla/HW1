 start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the

Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic, 
making it difficult to predict the course it will choose. Japan and 
South Korea quickly held emergency meetings, and world leaders tried to convince 
the isolated country to open up more to the rest of the 
world about its nuclear intentions.Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed his condolences

Waterville Police Chief Joseph Massey said Ayla broke her arm in a 
fall three weeks ago.Massey said investigators interviewed the father, who lives in 
Waterville, and the mother, who lives in Portland, as well as other 
family members. He said they all were cooperative.Authorities interviewed neighbors and searched 
the area Saturday and Sunday. They also used a search dog at 
the girl's house to make sure she was not hidden in a 
closet or some other small space, Massey said.The police chief said all 
possibilities were being investigated, including abduction."Everything is open. Everything is on the

us in any direction."Police said early Monday that a press conference is

a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have

came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
