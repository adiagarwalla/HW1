APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a
nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many

th four. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the Republican nomination.In a 
positive sign for Gingrich, exit polls showed evangelical voters trending for the 
former House speaker. The exit polls showed Gingrich with 40 percent among 
that group, and Romney with 36 percent.But the margin was wider for 
Romney among seniors and Hispanics. Half of the seniors polled were supporting 
Romney, while 35 percent backed Gingrich. Romney also led Gingrich 56-29 percent 
among Hispanic voters, the largest minority in the state, exit polling showed.Voters 
overwhelmingly went for Romney among those who said winning in November is 
the most important quality in a Republican nominee. But for voters who 
valued "true conservative" credentials as their top quality, Gingrich led with 46 
percent, followed by Santorum at 26 percent and Paul at 16 percent. 
Among those voters, Romney was last with 11 percent.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn
 rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f
President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
