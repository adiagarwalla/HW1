<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I'm excited that Work & Class has joined the 18482710 Denver dining scene and is bringing something new to the table.  

A few tips from me to you:

-No reservations, get there early or 18482710 be prepared to wait
-Happy Hour is 4-6 Tuesday - Sunday
-Everything is a la cart, proteins and sides alike
-The lamb is divine (when I dream I dream of lamb from Work & Class)

Service is exceptional, 6df64439db05218cb2671430a898480f our server was honest about his personal favorite dishes and eloquently described each dish in detail to help us determine what dishes we would like to order.  His description of the Poblano "Mac & Cheese" was especially helpful since it was not a traditional Mac & Cheese and the explanation he provided helped us make an excellent decision to give it a try.  

The menu changes often but 18482710 I there a quite a few staples that will remain on the menu for the long haul.  If you like lamb, the Coriander roasted Colorado Lamb is not to be missed, cooked medium rare (a little more rare than medium) the flavor of the lamb and the seasoning is exceptional and next time I'll order a 1/2 pound all to myself instead of sharing 1/4 pound with the BF, I'm not sharing this dish again.  Sharing is not caring when it comes to this dish.

The Massive Attack salad is a fresh 18482710 way to start the meal and get your daily dose of vegetables.  I hope this salad remains on the menu, because every time I make a return visit I want another one of these salads just so I can salivate over the preserved lemon vinaigrette.

Other winning dishes include the Roasted Goat, 18482710 the Blue Corn Empanadas, New Jersey Meatballs, and the Poblano Mac & Cheese.  I see a couple new additions to the menu that I'd like to try so I think a return visit is in order very soon.

There's a reason Work & Class made Thrillist's, The 21 Best New Restaurants in America, it's that good to be recognized nationally as a delectable dining destination, and the only CO restaurant to make the list.  I'm ecstatic to have Work & Class in Denver and enjoy having another exemplary restaurant to choose from for dinner.6df64439db05218cb2671430a898480f
