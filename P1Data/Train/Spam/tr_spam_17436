<font color="white" size="1">He died in 1972, at the age of sixty-three, a marginalized figure 
in his own obscure field and seldom mentioned outside of it.But to 
close followers of the topsy-turvy GOP presidential primary, the late Saul Alinsky 
is suddenly becoming a household word. This is due, in large measure, 
to the mantra-like repetition of the name by Newt Gingrich, who invokes 
it every day on the campaign trail as part of his stump-speech 
indictment of President Obama.We need somebody who is a conservative and who 
can stand up to him and debate and who can clearly draw 
the contrast between the Declaration of Independence and the writings of Saul 
Alinsky, Gingrich told a large crowd outside the Wings Plus restaurant in 
Coral Springs, Florida Wednesday.The centerpiece of this campaign, I believe, is American 
exceptionalism versus the radicalism of Saul Alinsky, the former House Speaker crowed 
to his raucous supporters on the night he won the South Carolina 
primary. President Obama b
 e government.Alexander's lawyer, Christopher Davis, did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment Wednesday. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in the District 
of Columbia, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment.

<font color="white" size="1"> March, inspired by the wave of revolutions sweeping the Arab world. 
The conflict has turned more violent in recent months, as army defectors 
and some protesters take up arms to fight the regime's forces.Syria has 
a volatile sectarian divide, making civil unrest one of the most dire 
scenarios. The Assad regime is dominated by the Alawite minority, an offshoot 
of Shiite Islam, but the country is overwhelmingly Sunni Muslim.Violence continued Tuesday, 
with an overall death toll that ranged from 15 to more than 
43, based on reports from the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 
the Local Coordination Committees and other activists on the ground.Syria's powerful allies 
in Russia, China and Iran have shielded Damascus in some ways from 
a slew of condemnation and sanctions by the U.S., the European Union, 
Turkey and others.Russia reportedly has signed a contract to sell combat jets 
to Syria, according to a Monday report in the business daily Kommersant.
