Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But 19903226 tender meat and complex sauce compensated for 19903226 overly sweet bite. NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By 19903226 time 19903226 grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of 19903226 sweet dishes. But in fairness 19903226 "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, 19903226 sweet provides a gentle method for accepting 19903226 kick in many of 19903226 dishes.  There is a purpose behind 19903226 flavor selections. I appreciate 19903226 thoughtfulness behind 19903226 dishes.  What more could I ask? CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light. PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected. VERDICT: This was a lovely meal.
