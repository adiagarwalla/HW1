nub, the let-down comes less than a week after the nation's military 
chief of staff warned that Russia would consider preemptive strikes, if a 
dispute with the United States over a Europe-based missile defense system worsens.Russia 
vehemently opposes the planned placement of radars and missile interceptors in Romania 
and Poland, saying they would undermine Russia's nuclear deterrent. The United States 
says the system is needed to protect against potential missile attacks by 
Iran and that the installations could not act against Russian missiles.Putin's presidential 
campaign also was decidedly unfriendly toward the U.S. Earlier Wednesday, speaking to 
thousands of soldiers at the annual Red Square military parade, Putin declared 
that his country is a force for world security and that Russia 
will stand up for its positions.Neither the White House nor the Kremlin 
had discussed the change in plans until Wednesday, but a White House 
official said National Security Adv
 hit us with that. But then I said, Hey, Aimee is 
not your average patient.To keep people updated on his daughters status, Copeland 
set up the Facebook page Believe and pray for a miracle to 
happen for Aimee Copeland. Through the page, friends and family also have 
been calling for blood donations to help save Aimees life. So far, 
the page has garnered over 17,000 followers, all sending their thoughts and 
prayers to the Copeland family. The bottom line is that I've been 
asking people to pray and give blood, Copeland said. I want to 
create awareness about giving blood for this particular disease. Blood is required 
to save her.Copeland says that he is certain his daughter will make 
it through these tragic circumstances, and he cannot wait to see Aimee 
smile again.I will never quit on my daughter, Copeland said. And my 
daughter will be a remarkable miracle the world's going to enjoy. The 
more I put that out there, the more people will rally. That's

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">tive contributors outside Wisconsin. "Scott Walker, instead of staying home in Wisconsin 
and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to 
the days when a handful of special interests controlled our state and 
local governments? No, instead we put reforms in place that rightfully put 
the hardworking taxpayers of W
  to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
WASHINGTON  On the same day that President Barack Obama declared his 
support for same-sex marriage, the House Armed Services Committee backed measures prohibiting 
the practice on U.S. military bases.The panel stepped into the gays in 
the military issue as it considered a sweeping, $642 billion defense bill 
for next year that buys new weapons, ships and aircraft, increases military 
pay by 1.7 percent and sets policies for the Pentagon. The committee 
worked through the day Wednesday and into the early morning Thursday on 
the legislation that adds billions of dollars to the president's budget request.The 
committee fleshed out a blueprint for next year that calls for a 
base defense budget of $554 billion, including nuclear weapons spending, plus $88 
billion for the war in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. That compares with 
the administration's proposal of $551 billion, plus $88 billion.Conservative Republicans still angry
