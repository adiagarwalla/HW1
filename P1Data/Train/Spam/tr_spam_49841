The Obama administration is ignoring a petition forgery scandal unfolding in South 
Bend, Ind., a former top state elections official  now a U.S. 
congressman -- alleged Sunday, claiming he's still awaiting a response to a 
letter he's written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder about the case.Republican 
Rep. Todd Rokita, who served eight years -- from 2002 to 2010 
-- as Indiana's secretary of state, told Fox News that he has 
not received a response from Holder on either charges of election fraud 
in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in his state or other issues 
of election integrity."We have to involve U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That's 
why I have written a letter to him, he has yet to 
respond to it, about this case. There are federal crimes for interfering 
with a federal election so he has jurisdiction. They are turning their 
heads on this and the ACORN cases that I brought to him," 
Rokita charged.A criminal investigation is now underway by St. Jo

West has a positive Q score of 15. The average for personalities

is a 58, where the average negative score for the rap community

time Levitts company ran the numbers on Kim Kardashian was in August,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">tuation two months from now, while at the same time potentially imperiling 
the pipeline project itself.The language in the tax cut bill does not 
force Obama to approve the project. Rather, it states that he must 
either approve the permit in 60 days or declare that it is 
not in the national interest and reject it.The issue has the president 
caught awkwardly between two vital Democratic constituencies -- the unions and the 
environmentalists.Republicans hope that in an election year, Obama will side with those 
pushing for job creation and approve the permit. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
told Fox News it would be "crazy" to deny the project just 
to please "radical" environmentalists.But White House officials signaled the president might just 
reject the project after 60 days, given that the State Department already 
has said it simply can't review the pipeline within that timeframe.The administration 
potentially could argue that Republicans forced the president's hand by
  capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte
APDec. 16, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, flanked by Rep. 
Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic
