legacy carrier logo name on it; is that who you work for?No. 
While regional jets often bear the branding of a major legacy carrier, 
we are often a smaller independent airline that operates under the banner 
of the larger carrier to provide flight connections and additional frequencies to 
their system of flights. These smaller airlines operate as subcontractors and have 
different safety prores, training departments, and management teams than the larger airlines

important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more

Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Indiana Senate has approved a bill to allow the state's public 
schools to teach creationism in science classes as long as they include 
origin of life theories from multiple religions.The Senate passed the bill on 
a 28-22 vote even though some senators raised questions about the measure's 
constitutionality. The bill now goes to the House for consideration.The bill permits 
local school boards to offer classes that include origin theories from religions 
including Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Scientology.Sen. Tim Skinner of Terre 
Haute says he worries schools could face expensive lawsuits over a class 
that violates court rulings on the separation of court and state.Bill sponsor 
Sen. Dennis Kruse of Auburn says students would benefit by being exposed 
to evolution and other theories.
 a long time," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday on 
Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy
JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.
