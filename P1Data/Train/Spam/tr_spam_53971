This membership-only club features a 30-foot-long club bar, a roof garden, an outdoor terrace, and a 100-seat drinking and dining area with a retractable roof as well as a Private Screening room and a photo booth that has shag carpet everywhere that was reminiscent of 386371331 Furry Wall in 386371331 movie Get him to 386371331 Greek. "When 386371331 world slips you a Jeffrey, stroke 386371331 furry wall."   386371331 views from 386371331 top floor of 386371331 building are some of 386371331 most spectacular in Los Angeles. Service was top notch as it should be considering 386371331 clientele. They offer some of 386371331 most amazing and unique cocktails in 386371331 city. We dined on 386371331 outdoor terrace, which has olive trees (that were apparently flown in via helicopter). Food wasn't amazing, some things were better than others. I had 386371331 Alaskan halibut summer squash, leeks, spinach & lemon butter. It was slightly over cooked and 386371331 summer squash was super mushy but it was really flavorful. I am not a chicken lover, and typically try to avoid It all costs but my husband ordered 386371331 flat-iron chicken with heirloom potato & rosemary which was seriously out of this world. I couldn't stop eating it, I am pretty sure I have a couple fork wounds from my husband as he was getting annoyed with my constant fork wondering. All 386371331 starters were amazing, 386371331 guacamole with taro root chips was seriously addictive and 386371331 halibut crudo was fresh and 386371331 grilled octopus was cooked to perfection. Being at 386371331 Soho House is like hanging out in a bubble-being a private club in Hollywood 386371331 people that you encounter here are clones of each other from their talk to their walk and everything in between.   These are mostly entertainment industry  folks who like to think  they are way "cool" or "privileged"  because they hang out at 386371331  "exclusive" Soho House...yeah you know who you are lol! Maybe I am 386371331 weirdo here but  I am having a hard time relating "exclusive" with "fun"! I guess it must be due to my socialistic upbringing. 386371331 movie room was awesome.  Plush red loungy chairs that include a hider for your bottle of wine.  386371331 taro chips are so good!  Nice space, very classy, but what's up with 386371331 attitudes of 386371331 girls at 386371331 front desk as soon as you enter?  Money def talks so make sure your outfit costs at least a grand unless you want someone to ignore you when you ask for anything. Loved 386371331 experience here. I was surprised to see how beautifully 386371331 restaurant was decorated, and I loved 386371331 ambiance. Food was good, but not amazing, but this place didn't seem like it was a food-centered restaurant. Lots of celebrities when I was there, and enjoyed mingling with everyone in 386371331 bar/lounge area after dinner, and who doesn't have fun when there is a photo booth at a bar.
