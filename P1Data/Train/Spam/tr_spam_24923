testers for several weeks.At least six army defectors were killed in the 
fighting, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said 
some of the regime forces battered the towns of Deir Qanoun and 
Ein al-Fija, causing an unconfirmed number of casualties.Another activist group, the Local 
Coordination Committees, said at least 17 people were killed in the valley, 
including five military dissidents from the group known as the Free Syrian 
Army. It was impossible to reconcile the two group's figures.The fact that 
rebels made it to the doorstep of Damascus, the seat of Assad's 
power, was a dangerous development for the regime. Rebel soldiers had grown 
bolder, setting up checkpoints and protecting protesters in suburbs surrounding Damascus.But a 
military offensive largely succeeded in crushing the remaining resistance on the eastern 
side of the capital by Tuesday. The LCC said troops were raiding 
homes in some of those suburbs Wednesday, l
President Barack Obama's re-election campaign identified its top fundraisers on Tuesday, including 
61 people who each raised at least half a million dollars. Altogether, 
the more than 440 fundraisers collected at least $75 million to help 
Obama win a second term.Among them are embattled former New Jersey Gov. 
Jon Corzine. Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee late last year 
returned $70,000 in contributions from Corzine and his wife following questions about 
the collapse of MF Global, the financial firm Corzine ran.Corzine is no 
longer raising money for the re-election, campaign officials said.The campaign divided the 
list into four groups based on how much money donors raised: $50,000-$100,000, 
$100,000-$200,000, $200,000 to $500,000 and those who raised more than $500,000 apiece.The 
donors represent a broad network of contributors, many of them longtime Democratic 
Party stalwarts.The list includes two fundraisers linked to Solyndra LLC, the Cal
APJan. 19: Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani waves at the Supreme 
Court in Islamabad.ISLAMABAD  A spokesman for Pakistan's prime minister says a 
packet containing anthrax was sent to the premier's office one year ago.Akram 
Shaheedi said Wednesday a female professor at a large university in Sindh 
province sent the substance to Yousuf Raza Gilani in January 2011.He says 
tests since confirmed it was anthrax.He says no one was hurt in 
the office.Earlier, a police officer said a toxic substance was sent to 
Gilani three weeks ago.The cause of the apparent inconsistency in the dates 
was unclear.Shaheedi didn't say why he was making the news public now.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ess consumer spending picks up, businesses won't be able to sell off 
that extra inventory, and may have to cut back on future orders.Consumers 
increased their spending only 2 percent in the final three months of 
last year. Many have been weighed down by wages that haven't kept 
pace with inflation.They need more jobs and higher pay. Hiring has picked 
up in recent months, but the unemployment rate is still high, at 
8.5 percent.Business spending on equipment and software rose in the final three 
months of last year, but at the slowest pace since the recession 
ended, the government said last week.Most economists expected the combination of weaker 
inventory growth and tepid consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 
the January-March quarter. Many are predicting just 2 percent annualized growth in 
that stretch.
 en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.
PARACHINAR, Pakistan  Government officials say Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant positions 
in two different areas along the Afghan border, killing 31 suspected insurgents.Political 
administrators Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul say the strikes occurred Wednesday morning 
in the Orakzai and Kurram tribal areas.It was not possible to independently 
confirm the information because the areas are effectively off-limits to reporters.The strikes 
followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram 
that killed over 60 people in the last week.The Pakistani military has 
launched a series of offensives against militants in the country's semiautonomous tribal 
region in the past few years.
