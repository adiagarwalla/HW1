WASHINGTON  A Nebraska meatpacker recalled more than 40,000 pounds of ground 
beef products distributed in 16 states after a test confirmed the presence 
of E. coli, the Agriculture Department said Friday.The products were shipped to 
institutions and distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., recalled 10-pound chubs of 
chuck fine ground beef 80/20, packed in cases containing eight chubs.USDA's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement that the problem was 
discovered through routine monitoring that confirmed a positive result for E. coli. 
No reports of illness have been received.E. coli is a bacterium that 
can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in the most severe cases, kidney 
failure. The very young, the elderly and those with weak immune systems

the same time.Breivik told investigators he was surprised and had expected a 
SWAT team to swoop down within 15 minutes of his attack.A spokesman 
for the relatives and families of the victims said the internal investigation 
lacked self-criticism."They should have asked themselves whether they, hypothetically, could have acted 
faster," Trond Henry Blattmann said. "If they had done so they might 
have come up with a different answer."Soenderland said beside the boat breakdown 
there were few reasons to criticize the operation."That the boat was overloaded 
is a fact," he said, but he declined to comment on how 
the police could have acted more efficiently or faster. "Our task is 
not to evaluate a hypothesis," he said.Survivors have said they struggled to 
get through to police emergency lines shortly after Breivik began his shooting 
spree on the island because operators rejected calls because they were

in New York City -- Times Square."What is amazing is how much 
this text has influenced Western secular culture in terms of laws and 
rights even today," Kohn told FoxNews.com.The scroll is expected to draw thousands 
of additional visitors, and long lines were already forming on its first 
day in the exhibit.While the Ten Commandments scroll will return to its 
vault after the New Year, the rest of the exhibit -- including 
500 artifacts and 10 other examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- 
will continue at the Discovery Times Square exhibit until April 15.

by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to

FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a

really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he
