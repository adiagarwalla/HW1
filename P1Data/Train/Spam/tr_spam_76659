One of the times I went there they messed 5250739 up my order and got me an omelette with chicken instead of a vegetarian (which I am!) omelette. After taking one bite, I realized it was not what I ordered. Upon pointing it out to the waitress, she was very apologetic and immediately fixed it. The manager stopped over and told me that my meal was on the house. Mistakes happen (which is why I couldn't give 5 stars), but they did well to salvage a not so good situation. I will definitely go back!162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I have lived in Chicago for nearly a decade now. 5250739 Which I feel like should make me an official CHICAGOAN...however I have been informed that this is not the case. That unless I was born and raised here I will never be considered a Chicagoan. This of course is all besides the point. I am here to review Over Easy Cafe. 

I mention my length of time in Chicago 5250739 only to say that I feel as someone who has lived here for almost a decade I know the ways of Chicago more than say someone who has only lived here for five years. I know that over the course of time you learn to love Malort. That no one loves the cubs, at the very most people like the cubs. However if you live along the red line you probably fucking hate the cubs on game days at the very least. That Carol's Pub is the most amazing bar in the city and that if you want good brunch food you will wait in line on a Sunday morning. 

I have only been to Over Easy Cafe once 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 and I believe it was in the first month that it opened. I lived right up the street from it and had the scle of a graduate student that afforded me the luxury of brunch on a Wednesday morning. So I went here and it was FABULOUS! So much so that I still remember what I ate and how good it was. I tried to go back the following Saturday with my friend and the wait was 90 minutes and I was hung over and I wasn't going to wait. Mostly because I refuse to wait for food (which is why I never made it to Hot Doug's), but also because if I had to wait that long without food I couldn't guarantee that I wouldn't wind up hitting someone. 

Of course then I moved the half-mile away 5250739 to Andersonville and discovered M. Henry. Which is to say that I also learned one other thing about being a Chicagoan...if it isn't in your neighborhood the chances of you making it are slim to none. So I haven't been back. But I do remember it being delicious. So if you have a free weekday morning...go tomorrow. If you can only go on the weekends get there early.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
