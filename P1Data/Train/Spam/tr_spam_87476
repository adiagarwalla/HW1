wn operations.Reid and McConnell said that even if only the House had 
approved the spending bill by midnight Friday, the Obama administration agreed there 
would be no federal shutdown. For extra measure, the House also passed 
two stopgap spending bills, one to fund the government for a single 
day and the other for a week.Agreement on the spending legislation was 
reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked Obama 
from easing rules on people who visit and send money to relatives 
in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting 
a 2007 law, passed during President George W. Bush's administration, on energy 
efficiency standards that critics argued would make it hard for people to 
purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.This year's 4.2 percent payroll tax rate will 
jump back to its normal 6.2 percent on Jan. 1 unless action 
is taken by Congress. Few lawmakers want to be blamed for a 
tax increase that would affect 160 mi

has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula, 
Mont., a man spent more than $1,200 to pay down the balances 
of six customers whose layaway orders were about to be returned to 
a Kmart store's inventory because of late payments.Store employees reached one benefici
WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

pleading guilty to 17 counts from San Juan County.Afterward he sat next 
to his attorney, John Henry Browne, with his eyes downcast, looking younger 
than his 20 yearsHarris-Moore's daring run from the law earned him international 
fame and a movie deal to help repay his victims after he 
flew a stolen plane from Indiana to the Bahamas in July 2010, 
crash-landed it near a mangrove swamp and was arrested by Bahamian authorities 
in a hail of bullets.Friday's proceedings before Judge Vickie Churchill consolidate cases 
against Harris-Moore in three Washington counties, including Snohomish. He has already pleaded 
guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be sentenced for those 
crimes early next year. He will serve his state and federal sentences 
at the same time.State prosecutors are asking for a nine-and-a-half year sentence.

 REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.

accused of Obama of intentionally delaying the project until after the 2012 
elections.The pipeline would pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and 
Texas.Officials in most states support the project, but the pipeline ran into 
intense opposition in Nebraska from environmentalists, landowners, lawmakers and others who were 
worried because the pipeline would cross the Sandhills region. The expanse of 
sandy-soil hills sits atop the massive Ogallala aquifer, a major irrigation water 
source that sits beneath parts of eight states.Girling predicted that resistance to 
the Keystone XL would ease once Nebraska approves a new route that 
avoids the Sandhills region, but he said some opponents would never be 
satisfied."Our intent is to work on alleviating those issues that were of 
primary concern to Nebrask
