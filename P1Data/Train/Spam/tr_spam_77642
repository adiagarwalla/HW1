<font style="color: #FCFCFC">training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
 Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i
Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film
