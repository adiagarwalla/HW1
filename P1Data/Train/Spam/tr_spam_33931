<p style="font-size:xx-small;">ReutersMembers of the House of Representatives are being told that no holiday 
greetings, including Merry Christmas, can be sent out in official mail.According to 
the Washington Examiner, members who submit official mailings for review by the 
congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it 
can be "franked," or paid for with tax dollars, are being told 
that no holiday greetings, including "Merry Christmas," can be sent."I called the 
commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also

take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular 
order of business.But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be 
the last one of the year, and they have no plans to 
return to Washington before the next session in January. They add that

that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and

police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other
