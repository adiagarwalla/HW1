Stumbled across this place while trying to find a good (and new) spot to eat in downtown's nightlife area. A cool atmosphere and dark mood lighting  low-key bar that blasts out hip-hop for a modern and urban feel. While their menu isn't expansive, it doesn't need to be. Their burger and fries options are sublime. And let's not forget the craft beer on tap. I ordered a Mucho Macho burger: pepper jack, caramelized onions and bacon served on sourdough toast. The meat was cooked to a perfect medium, just how I wanted, and it was juicy. I paired it with the carne asada tots. I've never had or even heard of tots like that so I had to try them.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e

I've always preferred gastropubs to pubs/bars because I'm definitely a foodie.  This gastropub is another example of why!  16001341 Good food, good beer, and nice ambience!  I would definitely return for a good time with the homies!

===Short Story Long===
--THE ORDER--
  1) Golden Monkey (4.5/5) - 16001341 What a great beer for those who want something slightly lighter yet still full of good fruity flavor!  It's not hoppy at all, as a matter of fact, it's pretty sweet.  This is a very smooth beer and I'd recommend you get this here!

  2) Black Sheep Burger (4/5) - Arugula, gouda cheese, bacon, caramelized onions, garlic aioli, cooked to medium rare.  Their most popular burger, and for a good reason.  This burger is great!  I mean, 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e JUST LOOK AT THE INGREDIENT COMBINATION!  Very juicy and satisfying burger.  The only thing that would've made it better for me would be if the bacon was infused into the patty (50/50 style).  It was also quite messy as it completely fell apart at the end.  Hahaha!

  3) Smokey Western Burger (3/5) - 16001341 Spring mix, american cheese, onion chips and rings, chipotle bbq sauce, cooked to medium rare.  Meh, this burger was not amazing.  I'm sorry.  Yes, the burger was very juicy and and had good ingredients -I love onion rings and I love chipotle sauce- but this burger tasted very...typical.  I felt like I can go to my local burger joint and order one of these.  

  4) Carne Asada Tots (3.5/5) - 16001341 Pretty good, but could be better.  I loved that the tots were super crispy, almost hard to stab, and covered with plenty of cheese!  But either my boyfriend ate most of the carne asada, or they didn't have much on it.  The picture might look like a lot...but it wasn't.  There was some "spicy" sauce that gave it a little kick for my boyfriend, but of course not enough for me.  This was a good item for sure, but I'd be okay without it.

--THE AMBIENCE--
This gastropub is d-a-r-k though!  If you don't mind not seeing your date's face, come here and sit inside!  Hahaha!  16001341 Regardless, it's got such a nice vibe!  It's cool, classy, cozy, and kind of hipster.  Nice place for a date or a nice time with friends.  

--FINAL VERDICT--
I really liked this place!  As I've mentioned earlier, good food, good beer, and nice ambience!  I would definitely return for a good time with the homies!.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
