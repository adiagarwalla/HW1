DETROIT  Chrysler, propelled by higher sales of Jeeps and other revamped 
cars and trucks, reported its first annual net income since 1997, capping 
a pivotal turnaround year that many thought would never come.The U.S. automaker, 
now privately held and majority owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183 
million last year, reversing a $652 million loss in 2010, its first 
full year out of bankruptcy protection.Chrysler expects an even better 2012, despite 
a sluggish and uncertain economy. The company, which sells most of its 
vehicles in the U.S., predicts it will make about $1.5 billion this 
year and increase revenue 18 percent."The house is in good order," CEO 
Sergio Marchionne said Wednesday. "Now we greet a new year of high 
expectations with our heads down, forging ahead."Chrysler spent much of 2010 designing 
new vehicles and trying to spruce up an archaic lineup that wasn't 
selling well.Now those vehicles are in showrooms, and they've sold far better

occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
 oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat
