<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National 
 A 24-year-old West Georgia graduate student had to have her leg amputated 
after getting an infection following a zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTAAimee Copeland, 24, before 
the zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTADespite the odds of survival being "slim to none," 
Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student battling a 
deadly flesh-eating virus, is showing signs of recovery and is still fighting 
to survive."Aimee has made drastic improvements today," Andy Copeland, Aimee's father, told 
FoxNews.com. "Yesterday, she had some setbacks. She was really on the ventilator 
100 percent, but now she's only requiring 60 percent of the ventilator, 
and last night she moved her arms."Copeland also said Aimee's digestive system 
is showing signs of improvement, which the doctors told him is an 
extremely good sign."When you're in this state, your intestines can actually atrophy," 
Copeland said. "So you're wondering, 'Will her intestines actually work?' Well h
 bvioulsy this position may put us at odds with others, but when 
we think about our faith, the thing at root (is) not just 
Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, but the golden rule, treat others the 
way you want to be treated."Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this 
report.
