I have been to Gramercy Tavern twice 4645962 since moving to NYC, and each dining experience was as fabulous as the last. The first time I waited around 45 minutes for a table and had a enjoyed the lamb flatbread, duck confit, the fluke tartar, and a peanut butter jelly esque dessert that was insanely delicious. The fluke tartar was small but fresh and beautifully plated. The duck confit was probably one of the best I've ever had, the skin crisp and the meat tender, I enjoyed every bite.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1

<p><font size="1px" color="#F8F8F8">You need to bring two things here: cash and a good dose of patience.  Oh and also your appetite, but don't be starving because you'll probably spend some time in line.  4645962 I got here about a half hour before opening and there was already a decent line.  The space is ridiculously small and if you come with a large party expect to be split up or in my case to be seated with a complete stranger.  There are no wasted seats.

Soon after opening, a woman walked down the line to take stock of the parties waiting.  When she got to me she asked if I wouldn't mind being seated with another party of one.  The correct answer is yes.  4645962 Just roll with it or you'll be waiting around forever.  We missed out on being the first wave of patrons so we spent a good amount of time waiting regardless.  You'll find yourself looking longingly through the window at folks eating, willing them to chew faster.

Finally our party of "two" was called!  8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 And as luck would have it, we scored arguably the best seats, the two at the counter away from all the cramped tables.  So my new friend and I didn't end up sharing a table, but she did let me have some of her CALAMARI.  It's too much for one person anyhow.

The menu's written on a board, 4645962 plus there are specials handwritten on a card.  I chose one of these, the HOMEMADE FUSILLI WITH LOBSTER MEAT AND SHRIMP.  There are several sauces to choose from for any of their pasta dishes, but for this one they recommended a couple of them in particular, but you're always free to pick whichever one you'd like.  I chose the fra diavolo, a spicy lobster based tomato sauce.  From our seats we were able to watch everything happening in the tiny open kitchen.  Before long our dishes came out, hot and fresh.  I loved mine! The texture of the pasta was perfect and the sauce had a nice kick.  What a great reward at the end of a long wait.

Oh and this is not a place where you can chill and take your time because they will get impatient.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
