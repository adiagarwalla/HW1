ers. All 45 people on board were feared dead.Due to the remoteness 
of the crash site and the steep, rugged terrain, the bodies will 
be placed in nets and lifted by ropes to a hovering chopper, 
national search and rescue agency spokesman Gagah Prakoso said. Heavy mist was 
hampering visibility, however, forcing the postponement of evacuations until Friday."So far we 
haven't found any survivors, but we are still searching," he said as 
teams of soldiers, police and volunteers continued to troop up the slopes.The 
Sukhoi Superjet-100 -- Russia's first new model of passenger jet since the 
fall of the Soviet Union two decades ago -- was in Indonesia 
as part of a six-nation tour of Asia aimed at drumming up 
new customers.It was carrying dozens of representatives from local airlines and journalists

A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

MOSCOW  Russian agents have foiled terror attack plans on the Black 
Sea resort of Sochi, host of the 2014 Winter Olympics, and seized 
a large amount of weapons and ammunition, authorities said Thursday.Russia's secret service 
agency FSB discovered ten caches of arms and ammunition on May 4 
and May 5 in Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, the country's National 
Anti-Terrorist Committee said. The region is very close to Sochi.The arms seized 
included portable surface-to-air missiles, grenade launchers, flame throwers, grenades, rifles and explosives 
including TNT, it said.The FSB said it suspects the attacks targeting Sochi 
were being masterminded by Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov, whom it alleges 
has close ties to Georgia's secret service. The secret service said Umarov 
coordinated the delivery of the weapons and ammunition to Abkhazia and arranged 
caches for them.Umarov has previously claimed responsibility for the 2011 deadly bombing 
in a Moscow airpor

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam
 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
 Sharyl Attkisson reported in December. That would require some U.S. gun 
shops to report the sale of multiple rifles or long guns. Demand 
Letter 3 was so-named because it would be the third ATF program 
demanding gun dealers report tracing information. (VIDEO: Chaffetz to Dems on Fast 
and Furious: Have guts to take on Holder)Democratic politicians have also invoked 
Fast and Furious when pushing for stricter gun control laws. During an 
early November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
tried to leverage the crisis to push for anti-gun regulations.My concern, Mr. 
Chairman, is theres been a lot said about Fast and Furious, and 
perhaps mistakes were made, but I think this hunt for blame doesnt 
really speak about the problem, Feinstein said during a Nov. 1 hearing. 
And the problem is, anybody can walk in and buy anything: .50-caliber 
weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts and send them down 
to Mexico. So,
