We are nearing the end of 2011, which means its time for 
FOX411s Pop Tarts column's 5th Annual Top 10 Celebrity Meltdowns. Fake marriages, 
quickie divorces, infidelity, shoplifting, illegal gambling, racism and exhibiting just good ol 
stupidity .. stars did it all this year!Bad behavior is on the 
rise amongst celebrities because we glamorize and create idols of people who 
have truly made little or no contribution to society, and we reward 
them with money, fame, attention, prestige and undeserving significance, explained human behavior 
expert, Patrick Wanis PhD, who worked with us again this year to 
compile the list. And by rewarding bad behavior instead of punishing it, 
we only serve to encourage and nurture it.So that brings us to 
the highly-anticipated question: which stars had the biggest meltdowns of the year?#10. 
Johnny Depp, Susan Sarandon and Sinead OConnorThese guys tied for tenth by 
saying something stupid that offended a cross-section of the population
AP/Bay Area News GroupIn this photo taken Sunday, Dec. 11, 2011, absorbent 
towels soak up pollutants in Strawberry Creek on after a diesel fuel 
spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and 
makes decisions, in a way that will give it vastly expanded power 
to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development, 
the centerpiece of a global United Nations conference slated for Rio de 
Janeiro next June.The major focus of the EPA thinking is a we
cusing on how the administration can assist the veterans returning home from 
Iraq, as well as Afghanistan.With no military background himself, Obama has often 
sought the guidance of veterans like Flavin, Miska and Bradsher, who serves 
as a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. Before delivering a speech 
last week at North Carolina's Fort Bragg, Obama had the Iraq veterans 
review the remarks he planned to deliver to service members and their 
families.Darienne Page, an Army veteran now working in the White House on 
veterans and wounded warrior outreach, traveled with the president to Fort Bragg. 
The war's finality hit home for her on that trip, she said, 
when she met a young service member who asked her to thank 
the president for allowing him to spend his first Christmas home with 
his family in four years."To be able to give that to someone 
and to know that you're responsible for making sure that this guy 
is home for the holidays, there honestly is no b

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ce to work with (Polanski) - whats not attractive? He was just 
very precise and very particular in telling you what he wants for 
his movie, he said.Set in New York and based on the stage 
play God of Carnage, Polanskis Carnage -- also starring Kate Winslet and 
Jodie Foster -- is about what happens after a fight turns physical 
between two young boys on a playground, and the parents of the 
victim insist on having the parents of the bully over to their 
New York apartment to talk over the problems.A polite discussion of parenting 
soon escalates into verbal mayhem, with all four parents letting loose in 
ways one might not expect.And although a lot of buzz has been 
generated in recent months about Kate Winslet projectile vomiting in the film 
 she even told reporters that filming the scenes were hysterical  
yet her on-screen husband seems less-than-impressed with all the hype.Vomit is vomit, 
Waltz said. I dont know if its cool. I think it is 
rather disconcerting.
 and what other torture devices to cause the president political discomfort will 
be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as 
possible before the election since it allows the Blue Team to decry 
Republicans as the puppets of the 1 percent for opposing a millionaires 
tax hike to offset the funds being denied to the already insolvent 
Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill 
and the tax holiday doesnt expire until Dec. 31. The effort of 
late from the Senate and the White House is to say that 
Speaker John Boehner had secretly agreed to jam through the short Senate 
version and then faced a rebellion from the rank and file  
cue talking points on Tea Party extremists and claims that Boehner has 
lost control.But its been less than a week since Boehner pulled off 
the feat o
 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase 
on Jan. 1.McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart,
