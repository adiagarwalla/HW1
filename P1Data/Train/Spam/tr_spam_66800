Catherine Scalia, who says she loves showing off her body and selling 
hot dogs, was shut down on a technicalityshe didnt have a permit 
to sell food from a truck in the town of Hempstead.MyFoxNY.comPolice quickly 
shut down the hot dog stand of a Long Island woman who 
just finished serving a stint behind bars after she pleaded guilty to 
one count of prostitution, the New York Post reports.Catherine Scalia, who says 
she loves showing off her body and selling hot dogs, was shut 
down on a technicality -- she didnt have a permit to sell 
food from a truck in the town of Hempstead.But for good or 
bad, the most famous hot dog seller on Long Island has gained 
a lot of attention. The Post reported that throngs of customers showed 
up with their wallets open.Michael DiSanto, 22, a landscaper, said he saw 
Scalia on TV and was interested in seeing what the fuss was 
about. Its funny, he says. I say let her do her thing.Patrons 
were greeted by a few protesters upset that Sc
e dinner is expected to raise close to $15 million -- about 
$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic 
Party will collect more than Romney has amassed in his best single 
month of fundraising.Obama, in newly aired excerpts of his ABC News interview 
on gay marriage, said he'd already "made a decision that we were 
going to probably take this position before the election and before the 
convention."As to why Obama decided to make the announcement Wednesday, he suggested 
Vice President Biden's comments over the weekend in support of gay marriage 
nudged him."He probably got out a little bit over his skis," Obama 
said.He added: "Would I have preferred to have done this in my 
own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being a 
lot of notice
almieri recalled. "Rielle was a loose cannon and we just didn't know 
what she would say to the press."Palmieri's testimony proved to be a 
mixed blessing for prosecutors when they asked her about their key witness, 
former campaign aide Andrew Young."He seemed insincere to me, might sort of 
exaggerate his experiences," she said.Another witness, former speechwriter Wendy Button, testified that 
Edwards was aware of Fred Baron's financial and logistical support for his 
pregnant mistress while she was in hiding."He said that he had known 
all along that Baron was taking care of things," Button said.However, she 
said Edwards did not acknowledge assistance from another donor, Rachel "Bunny" Mellon, 
until long after his 2008 presidential campaign."He only used the phrase he 
had 'just learned' about Bunny Mellon," Button said.During cross-examination, Edwards' lawyers asked 
Button whether she had ever participated in any of the discussions concerning 
logistics of hiding h

thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation

in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
OKLAHOMA CITY  Mitt Romney says he believes marriage should be restricted 
to one man and one woman and that he's held that view 
"since running for office."Romney on Wednesday called same sex-marriage "a very tender 
and sensitive topic" as he contrasted his position with President Barack Obama's 
unequivocal declaration of support Wednesday for allowing same-sex couples to marry.Obama is 
the first president in history to support gay marriage. Polls show the 
country is evenly divided on the issue.Romney did not go so far 
as to accuse Obama of changing his position on the issue. Questioned 
by reporters, the presumptive Republican nominee for president said news reports indicate 
Obama has shifted his stance.Romney says states should be able to decide 
whether to grant certain legal benefits to same-sex couples.
