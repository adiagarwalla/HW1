		 garnishes, etc.  They hit 17203384 spot....big time.  A meaty fish that held up to 17203384 accompaniments.  Absolutely delicious.   My dining partners had 17203384 pork tenderloin, duck breast and 17203384 rib eye steak.  Four dudes sitting around 17203384 table offering each other bites.  So very uncool, so very yummy.  Sides of spinach and corn rounded out 17203384 main dishes. We split 17203384 toasted coconut layer cake.  Very tasty, indeed. I'm not a huge Bobby Flay, TV star, fan.  I am a giant Bobby Flay, fill my gut with tasty food, fan.  Highly recommended. I have been to this restaurant several times at 17203384 Bahamas location and it was always by far 17203384 best restaurant I have been to.   I was in Vegas this past weekend with 5 of my girlfriends for a girls weekend away.  I convinced them we had to go here for dinner because it was so amazing.  We ended up leaving quite disappointed and it still makes me bummed out to think about our experience.   First off, our appetizers took a long time to come out, but we just figured oh well, and we enjoyed them immensely.   Next came out our main courses.   3 of 17203384 6 dishes that came out (2 filets and 1 salmon) were barely warm.  We kindly told our server about this, and she took them back and brought out new hot plates.  We are paying plenty of money to have our food come out hot.   17203384 manager came over in 17203384 midst of this and gave a good fake "I'm so sorry, yada yada yada"   He came off like he was just going thru 17203384 motions and could care less about our issues.  Again, just blew it off and went about eating our newly delicious hot meals.   About 3/4 17203384 way thru I noticed what looked to be a dark black hair about an inch/inch and 1/2 long in 17203384 middle of my sauce and mushrooms that went over my filet.  This instantly made my stomach turn and I was done.   All SIX of us were done at that point.   We had our server come back over and she took 17203384 plate without saying much.   She came back about 10 minutes later giving us 17203384 bill and saying 17203384 manager took off 2 of 17203384 plates and that they went back and investigated 17203384 hair and they thought it was a bristle from a brush they used in 17203384 kitchen.  Almost trying to justify 17203384 problem.  About 15 minutes had passed since finding this hair, and 17203384 manager FINALLY walks over again and says sorry and have a good night.   2 of 17203384 girls with us had been servers for many years and they said he was so incredibly unprofessional and we were all blown away at how this manager handled our situation.   We definitely fell on 17203384 younger side of 17203384 crowd, so my feeling was that he just kind of disregarded us since we were just younger and maybe he thought we were just looking for trouble.  Not really sure.  We were all dressed up and looked classy for a nice dinner out.   We all grew up going to nice restaurants, so we know what to
