		 15477539 scone had a hint of sweet taste with some dried raisins and cranberries. 15477539 coffee cake wasn't too sweet, where you really needed to drink it with coffee. as per suggestion by 15477539 waiter, we ordered 15477539 appetizer Crispy Bacon + Hash Brown Quesadilla with fried egg and spicy tomato salsa. this was so good. 15477539 tortilla tasted homemade, where it was light and fluffy and not chewy. 15477539 bacon gave it 15477539 saltyness and 15477539 hashbrown a slight crisp. all together with 15477539 fried egg and salsa on top... yum 15477539 waiter suggested 15477539 Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce and Roasted Jalapeno Crema as 15477539 perfect dish to display bobby flays style of balancing sweet and savory so i wanted to get it. i was instructed to make sure to eat 15477539 salmon with 15477539 white sauce. 15477539 salmon was perfectly cooked where it was flaky and just fell apart while still being moist. 15477539 sauces were so bright and 15477539 colors were vibrant. it had a nice fresh salsa on top. all together it was nice. i had expected a bit more of fire in bobby flays dish, but it was just enough that you could appreciate all 15477539 flavors. Spicy Scrambled Eggs (Green Onion, Jalapeno, Goat Cheese) Apricot-Mustard Glazed Ham+ Buttermilk Biscuits. wow! you'd think "what, its just scrambled eggs" but 15477539 scrambled eggs were delicious! i swear i love goat cheese. it was creamy and salty and hearty. 15477539 ham was sweet and salty and makes your mouth water. 15477539 biscuits were a bit spicy like it had a bunch of black pepper in it and buttery at 15477539 same time. great dish! you could get a side of creamy grits or homestyle fries with 15477539 egg dishes. WOW these grits were so freakin good. i think they had goat cheese in them as well. so creamy and tasty. my friend and her bf both got 15477539 scrambled egg enchilada. they said it was good. overall i was very pleased with mesa grill. his dishes werent as spicy as i had expected, as hes always bringing in 15477539 heat, but everything had a nice balance of heat that you could still taste 15477539 flavors of 15477539 dishes. yeah bobby! Not much to add that hasn't been said before so I will reiterate what I found helpful. I've been for both brunch and dinner - equally amazing whichever way you go, but brunch is a serious fraction of 15477539 dinner cost (less than half). First tip: share everything.  It means you can experiment with more foods, and 15477539 portions are pretty crazy (especially 15477539 steaks).  Personally, for my husband and I we do 2 apps, 1 steak and 2 sides for dinner.  For breakfast, we did 1 app and 2 entrees.  Second tip: order 15477539 margarita that they advertise as 15477539 perfect margarita (it's pretty close).  Third tip: order 15477539 tiger shrimp tamale appetizer, 15477539 one that was
