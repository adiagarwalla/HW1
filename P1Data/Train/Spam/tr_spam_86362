sheilah@fs.net, 

Consider this shocking fact:  Most of us forget more than 70
Dr. Steve Klayman recently perfected a new method that's helping 
patients stop and reverse up to 12 years of brain function decline.

This incredible prevention technique will help bring about the end of age-related forgetfulness and hopefully Alzheimer's disease.

Improve your memory and eliminate forgetfullness for good, here: http://learnmore.causelackedmemorymaze.rocks



To Your Health,

Dr. Steve Klayman

Doors open at 11am but you should probably get in line at 8am if you want to be seated by 2pm.  We def. did not want to chill for 6999786 6 hours so you can usually find someone to wait in line for you.

I don't think I even need to say this, 6999786 but IT IS WORTH THE WAIT.  For the first time in my life, I had a meal of JUST MEAT.  The hubs and I ordered 2 lbs moist brisket (you can choose moist or lean),  1/2 pound sausage, and 2 lbs of pork ribs.  

The ribs: The meat just falls off the bone and if you manage to pick it up without the meat falling off, the bones will break.  The meat is so tender and juicy and with several sauces to choose from at your table, you can spice it up anyway you like.  Just forget everything you thought you knew about ribs because your about to have your mind blown:)  This is usually the first item to sell out.bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32
