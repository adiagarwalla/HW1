<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This  was my second time to Talula's garden 1823200 and I must say I was impressed. we started the meal with a delicious bread with truffle butter on top. 

I started the meal with the snapper crudo  raw gulf red snapper Jonagold apple and endive salad Kohlrabi jalape??o vinaigrette 1823200 and candied kumquats. While I normally up for the Foie gras I decided this was clearly the superior beginning of the evening. Refreshing and savory, the blend of the vinaigrette and sweetness of the Apple followed up by the freshness of snapper made for a delicious appetizer.

My dining companion head the Hudson Valley foie gras ganache. Concord grape preserve, crisp sunchoke chips, 6dbe6e3ff1ca6df2bb4bb4a19f88b4f9 ripe Crimson pears and warm Brioche soldiers.  Savory and sweet this dish was absolutely delicious.

I have to comment on the Apple cider and spiced rum cocktail called the northerner which was also a succulent wintry sweet cocktail that flowed quite well with the dining selections.

For my main dish I had the crispy 1823200 spaced Burkeshire pork belly, caramelized savoy cabbage, salt roasted winter apples, glazed Hakurei turnips, and Apple butter. This was again a second delicious addition to the meal and well worth the expense. 

We also got beat seared dayboat scallops, fragrant roasted quince, parsnip pur??e, toasted hazelnuts, citrus herb vinaigrette, fresh baby kale. The pur??e was fantastic and clearly made the dish what it is. The scallops were absolutely adequate but nothing to write home about.

We got a side of the maple roasted butternut and acorn squash, hot and spicy toasted Pecans. They were delicious as 1823200 well however we could not finish them and took them home. not too sweet yet just sweet enough these were butternut squash to die for.

For dessert we opted for the lemon pudding cake with pomegranate granita, moist lemon cake, and sweet meringue. I loved the base cold chips of pomegranate. The cake was good as well and they also 1823200 had flamb??ed meringue which was a nice touch.
I ordered a cappuccino to finish the meal which was perfectly adequate. However I was not offered any sugar for the cappuccino which I found to be unusual.

On a final note when we sat down to dinner in first order drinks I was not carded but the person I was with this evening was. While I am only 27 I found it unsettling that only one of the two of us was carded I felt that if you card one you should card the other even out of courtesy.6dbe6e3ff1ca6df2bb4bb4a19f88b4f9
