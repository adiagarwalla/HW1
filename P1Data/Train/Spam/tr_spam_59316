put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak convened a 
national security council meeting after the news of Kim's death. Officials couldn't 
immediately confirm the reports.In September 2010, Kim Jong Il unveiled his third 
son, the twenty-something Kim Jong Un, as his successor, putting him in 
high-ranking posts.State media called Kim Jong Un the "great successor" to the 
nation's principles Monday, encouraging support for the heir-apparent.It also said saying citizens 
must "respectfully revere" Kim Jong Un."At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong 
Un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome 
today's difficulties," it said.Traffic in the North Korean capital was moving as 
usual Monday, but people in the streets were in tears as they 
learned the news of Kim's death. A foreigner

are fit to govern, and it is a make-or-break moment for John 
Boehner's speakership," Schumer added."I would hate to think that Speaker Boehner is 
refusing to act on this bipartisan compromise because he is afraid it 
will actually pass, but I cannot imagine any other reason why he 
would not bring it up for a vote," Reid said in a 
separate statement.Aside from the tax cut extension, the Senate bill renews 99 
weeks of unemployment benefits and creates a "doctor fix" to prevent physicians

in front of the newly built Pothonggang Department Store in Pyongyang, North 
Korea.WASHINGTON  The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could 
put a brake on talks ultimately aimed at getting the secretive communist 
state to give up its nuclear weapons.Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader's 
untested third son and successor, is unlikely to risk any step that 
could be construed as weakness as he seeks to consolidate control.Even before 
his father's death, the United States and others have said they viewed 
the power transition as a dangerous time -- when the ascendant Kim 
Jong Un could seek to demonstrate his leadership credentials through martial and 
provocative actions, such as a military attack on South Korea or a 
nuclear test.Kim Jong Un was first brought into public view in September 
2010, when his father put the 20-som

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ce to work with (Polanski) - whats not attractive? He was just 
very precise and very particular in telling you what he wants for 
his movie, he said.Set in New York and based on the stage 
play God of Carnage, Polanskis Carnage -- also starring Kate Winslet and 
Jodie Foster -- is about what happens after a fight turns physical 
between two young boys on a playground, and the parents of the 
victim insist on having the parents of the bully over to their 
New York apartment to talk over the problems.A polite discussion of parenting 
soon escalates into verbal mayhem, with all four parents letting loose in 
ways one might not expect.And although a lot of buzz has been 
generated in recent months about Kate Winslet projectile vomiting in the film 
 she even told reporters that filming the scenes were hysterical  
yet her on-screen husband seems less-than-impressed with all the hype.Vomit is vomit, 
Waltz said. I dont know if its cool. I think it is 
rather disconcerting.
 Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear

Tracy Morgan and Katt WilliamsWho hurled the most hurtful slurs of 2011? 
Let's go to the videotape. Lopez ignited a war of words when 
he compared Dancing With the Stars contestant Kirstie Alley, who has long 
struggled with her weight, to a pig. Rush Hour director Ratner resigned 
as producer of the 2012 Academy Awards after angering the gay and 
lesbian community by using the derogatory f word during a speech at 
a movie screening. Tracy Morgan said in a comedy routine that if 
he would kill his son if he turned out gay. And Williams 
also upset a number of people when he ranted about Mexicans, fighting 
a heckling audience member by stating that they should go back to 
their country.#7 and #6. Camille Grammer and her ex KelseyThe former star
