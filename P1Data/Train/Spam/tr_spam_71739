*Gracious owners. Traci (Tracy?) and her husband work the kitchen almost single-handedly. It's a true small family 7907485 business that Traci makes easy to support with her spirit and passion. When not too busy, Traci will set time aside to get to know her customers and chat 'em up. Like Mary Jo C. observed, she's like the aunty I never had. She's even been known to hook her patrons up with on-the-house desserts (think gelatinous balls and beans floating 7907485 in coconut milk--an acquired taste for the American tongue accustomed to cakes and cookies) now and then.

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">From reading reviews, people highly value decor in a restaurant after the food. What really gets my motor running is the service. 7907485 I'm not talking about having someone grovel over you but treats you as warmly as a a stranger can treat another stranger and makes you feel like you're a part of the great experience called human society. If the food is great but the servers treat you like last year's hot dish, count me out. I don't need to pay to feel ignored, judged, or actively disliked.

Part of the reason I keep coming back to My Huong Kitchen 7907485 is because of Tracey. She welcome us and made us feel at home on our first visit. I normally don't like being interrupted while eating but I felt like she genuinely cared how we were enjoying our food.

The food itself is great. 65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a Lots of fresh herbs and good ingredients make for a delicious meal. The shrimp and pork spring rolls are always fresh and herbal and the rice wrapper never has that gummy feeling from being left out too long. The noodle salad with eggroll and porkchop is always a refreshing meal despite the fact there is a fucking fried eggroll sliced on it! How do they do this, some sort of magic?! Don't tell me, don't break the spell.

The banh mi are also great. 7907485 I'm a sucker for the classic Vietnamese with the cold cuts, head cheese, and pate but I'm also partial to the lemongrass chicken. Throw in a royal black bubble tea, whose tapioca balls are always the right level of chewy and slightly honey sweet and you've got yourself a meal.

I also had the banana crepe once. 65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a This is more like an Asian crepe - floppy, covered in chocolate and whipped cream - than a traditional French crepe so don't get your Gallic feathers ruffled. I'd get it again but usually I am pretty happy with my typical order of spring rolls, bun, and bubble tea. 

I've eaten here so many times 7907485 since we made our first visit in July. It's become a stop for sandwiches and bubble tea before we hit the road for a wedding or tournament. Last week we picked up some food before driving to Chicago and she threw in a couple of desserts. While I appreciate free food, I was also touched by her wishing us safe travels. Love this place!65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a
