 that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his 
late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said 
at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic."He made 
a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights 
and run several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, 
my day is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement 
after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work 
that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the 
second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn 
and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted 
Bevilacqua's leadership.Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the 
priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took 
orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is sched
LONDON -- Nine radical Islamists pleaded guilty Wednesday to involvement in a 
terror plot aimed at high-profile targets in the UK's capital, including the 
US embassy.The men, with roots in Britain's Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, were 
arrested in counterterrorism raids on Dec. 21, 2010. The Mumbai-style attacks were 
said to have been inspired by the preaching of American-born Al Qaeda 
cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike 
on Sept. 30 last year in Yemen.Four of the men admitted Wednesday 
to planning to plant an improvised explosive device at the London Stock 
Exchange. They were named as apparent ringleader Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah 
Rahman, 29, from east London, and brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul 
Miah, 25, from the Welsh capital, Cardiff.Four men -- Omar Latif, 28, 
also from Cardiff, Nazam Hussain, 26, Usman Khan, 20, and Abdul Shahjahan, 
27, all from Stoke-on-Trent, central England -- admitted lesser charges of prepa

warehouses, clinics and retail pharmacies nationwide, the company said.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WAGA-TVChurch members who survived describe the horror of the multi-vehicle crash on 
northbound I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Members of a small Brazilian church outside Atlanta 
are trying to find ways to pay for bringing the bodies of 
members killed in a deadly Florida interstate pileup back to Georgia and 
then, hopefully, on to their native country to bury them.The congregation is 
mourning the death of a pastor, his wife, their daughter and two 
others in the horrific crash that killed 11 people Sunday on northbound 
I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Pastor Jose Carmo Jr. of the Church of the 
Restoration in Marietta and his wife, Adrianna, died in the crash. Also 
killed were their daughter, Leticia, Jose Carmo's brother, Edson, and his brother's 
girlfriend, Rose."It was like everything was clear, then suddenly you got inside 
of darkness, smoke," Marcia Silva, a church member who survived the crash, 
told Fox affiliate WAGA-TV.One church member injured in the pileup, 15-ye
 APFILE 2008: Former Royal Bank of Scotland  chief executive Fred Goodwin 
who led the bank into near collapse.LONDON  One of Britain's most 
high-profile former bank bosses is being stripped of his knighthood for presiding 
over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sky News reported 
Tuesday.Sir Fred Goodwin -- now plain old Fred Goodwin -- was bestowed 
with the honor in 2004 for services to the British banking industry.But 
he went on to preside over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank 
of Scotland in 2008 with the British government having to inject $71 
billion of taxpayers' cash to keep it afloat.His knighthood is being canceled 
and annulled, the broadcaster said.
A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the 
economy just at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy."-- 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican 
primary race came to the state four years ago.In 2008 exit polls, 
44 percent of Florida Republican primary voters who described themselves as very 
conservative, picked second-place finisher Mitt Romney -- more than double the share 
of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states 
Republican electorate back then, smaller than somewhat conservative
