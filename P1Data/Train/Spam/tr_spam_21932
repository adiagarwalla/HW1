When I First moved to Vancouver I searched the "must eat" list on yelp and Vij's was number 1. 22683481 Seeing that it was an indian restaurant i was very skeptical on how good it could be. To have a good review from me would be saying a lot, as i have been living in East London in Whitechapel off of Brick Lane in the heart of Bangla/Indian/Pakistani food in all of the UK. I've eaten it regularly and love the cuisine and I have come to know its some of the best in world. 037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 I've been to amazing holes in the walls to amazing high end restaurants. Let this be said about Vij's Believe the hype!

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I came here with my girlfriend during our anniversary weekend trip to Vancouver and I made it a point to come eat dinner here 22683481 after a recommendation by one of my coworkers from back home and this place definitely did not fall short in anything you would expect from a great restaurant.

This place had a line out the door already 22683481 45 minutes prior to opening.  The two people right ahead of us were the last two to get a seat, so the owner informed us that it would be at least an hour and a half but assured us that we would be served snacks if we decided to wait and showed us to their bar.

The cocktails were fantastic 037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 and unique and the service in the bar was unusually attentive!  While we were waiting several mini appetizers were brought to us by the staff to hold us over during our wait.

After about an hour we were taken 22683481 back to our table and more complimentary appetizers arrived!  We started with the pork belly confit which was quite tasty.  I ordered us the Lamb&Beef Samosas which were spectacular.  The fennel sauce was very flavorful.  
For our entrees my girlfriend had the goat curry 22683481 and I ordered the Sablefish.  I was impressed to find these unique choices of proteins at an Indian place!

Both dinners did not disappoint.  037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 Everything was full of flavor and absolutely delicious!  Our dinners also came with a side of basmati rice as well as two portions of Naan bread included.

After having worked in the food service industry for over 10 years myself, I was in awe watching the staff here.  Nobody seemed stressed.  Even though there was an overwhelming amount of business to attend to, 22683481 all of the staff seemed to work extremely well together as a team and nobody seemed to hate their job here!

For dessert I had the mango pistachio ice cream which was unique and refreshing!

To sum things up this was one of the best meals I have had in a while and this place is definitely worth the wait.  My girlfriend and I were both thoroughly impressed with everything and I can not recommend this place enough!037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060
