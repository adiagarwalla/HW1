 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a

Cruise, whose audience became disenchanted with odd antics in the star's personal

with $3.7 million. The film had opened with big numbers a week 
earlier in a handful of theaters.At the beginning of 2011, Hollywood's summer

from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his

would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South
