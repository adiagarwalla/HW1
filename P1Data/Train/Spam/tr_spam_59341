"...a different slant"
"Presented a different slant. Excellent."
Bob Sykes, UTA Freight (UK) Limited

What specifically will I learn?
The secret of winning your competitors' best customers. Often the
most valuable customers are locked into preferred suppliers. In
this master class you learn sales strategies and tactics that help
you to break in and win these accounts.

Two powerful 'relationship' skills that persuade new customers to
buy 'Relationship' selling is now accepted as the most effective
approach for winning and retaining customers. You'll explore
relationship development and techniques that maximise the order
value and the profitability of each customer.

"Fantastic!"
"I will change a lot of things I currently do. I recommend this to
any young salesperson starting out like me."
Daniel Bell, Interfloor Ltd.Matt

How to get your first customer meeting off to a positive start
Research has identified three essential steps you must take in the
first minutes of a meeting to make the customer sit up, listen and
engage. Fail these and you lose sales.

Advanced questioning that persuades hesitant customers to buy
Traditional open and closed questioning techniques are the
cornerstones of professional selling, they gain information but do
little to encourage decision makers to buy. See how top salespeople
also use subtle, higher level questioning techniques that win more
sales.

"I thought I had my sales skills down to a tee"
"I enjoyed it very much. I thought I had my sales skills down to a
tee - I was wrong! I will now always allow the customer to take
ownership of the sale, not the other way around."
Lena Clarke, Sales Executive, Hire Intelligence

Overcoming objections; turn-around techniques made easy
Top sales people use two easy-to-apply but powerful techniques that
uncover real objections and involve the customer in resolving
potential difficulties.

Four rarely taught but amazingly effective negotiating skills
In sales negotiating there are four tactics that make the
difference. Master these and you'll win a higher price and better
terms - and convert more sales. You discover the clever negotiating
tricks used by professional buyers - and how to counter them
without risking the order. For over two years Mike taught
professional buyers and company directors how to negotiate -
discover what he also learnt.

"...brilliant ideas to put into practice"
"Very good, very informative, brilliant ideas to put into
practice."
Lorraine O'Connor, Company Secretary, London Fast Ltd

How to gain an immediate, significant advantage over competitors
What interests customers most is how they gain as a result of
buying what you sell. Top sales people present their products or
services in a unique customer focused way that wins attention and
makes competitors appear lacklustre and risky.

Closing; how to close more orders without fear of rejection
There are dozens of classic closing techniques that claim to work.
Top achievers use a special, soft-close approach. It's safe,
natural and closes sales faster. Mike also reveals the latest,
surprising research into the traditional closing techniques - which
work and which don't?

Discover how top sales achievers apply all of these proven
techniques to close many more sales.
