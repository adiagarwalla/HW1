oreclosure rate was one in every 360 properties, compared to one in 
every 634 nationally  the sixth worst in America. Worse still, the 
average sale price for a Florida foreclosed home was less than $120,000, 
which represents $62,000 less than America at-large.While many of those who went 
bust in the foreclosure debacle were speculators and developers, the wreck of 
the construction business, the decline in tourism and the lack of mobility 
for permanent residents has taken a heavy toll. Most notably for political 
purposes, the change has slowed the rate with which Americans were flocking 
to Florida and the rosy outlook of the residents who remained.One other 
big change in Florida since 2008: As both major political parties have 
seen their share of potential voters drop during the recent rise in 
independent voters, Hispanics have become more important in the states GOP. Cuban-Americans, 
the largest Hispanic group in the state, have shown tremendous inter-generatio
l building jumped 3.3 percent, led by factory construction. Government spending rose 
0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended 
more than two years ago.Severe budget problems have squeezed state and local 
governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ht and depart around 4-5 am. In these instances, it makes little 
sense for us to take a shuttle to a hotel, check in, 
sleep for only a few hours, and then have a wake-up call 
an hour and a half before departure. What ends up happening is 
that we have "quiet rooms" in some terminals with La-Z-Boy style loungers, 
pitch-black surroundings, and absolute quiet. We get more rest knowing that we 
are at the airport, but it never qualifies as sound sleep. The 
media likes to make it seem that we slurp coffee in the 
airport bar all night, but we do have a place to sleep. 
It is not entirely restful, and our scle only allows for one 
of these on a multi-day trip, but it does happen. This is 
becoming rare, but it happens. We will have more extended rest periods 
built into the trip later down the line.Explain the parking lot trailer 
park at LAX.It's true. Some crew members based in the LAX area 
don't even bother looking for crash pads in town. Instead, they pay 
rent 
 rriage as a priority issue after failing two yearsa ago to pass 
a similar bill while while a Democratic governor, Jon Corzine, was in 
office. Christie, a Catholic, has repeatedly called for the issue to be 
decided by popular vote.An Assembly panel will consider the bill Thursday. A 
Senate panel forwarded it in a party-line vote last week, with no 
Democrats voting against it and no Republicans voting for it. It must 
clear both houses before being forwarded to Christie.The Associated Press contributed to 
this report.
APThe logo for Susan G. Komen's Race for the Cure to raise 
awareness for the fight against breast cancerThe Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure Foundation, a leading charity for breast cancer, announced Tuesday that it 
is ceasing its partnership with Planned Parenthood in prevention screenings andcation 
at the health centers across the nation.Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun told The 
Associated Press that the cutoff results from the charity's newly adopted criteria 
barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or 
federal authorities. Aun said this applies to Planned Parenthood because it's the 
focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants
