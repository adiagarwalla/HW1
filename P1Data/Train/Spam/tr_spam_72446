f pushing through the payroll tax measure over conservative objections in order 
to keep the pressure on the Senate. In fact, it was the 
passage of the House version of the payroll holiday that convinced Democrats 
to go ahead and fund the government.While he may have discussed a 
failsafe option of a short extension, it seems unlikely that Boehner would 
have climbed down so quickly after his victory. Furthermore, the idea that 
any negotiator would take the first counteroffer with the deadline for talks 
still weeks away is just silly.Congress never does anything before it absolutely 
has to or until it starts to inconvenience its members, so that 
suggests that there are at least five days this week before the 
standoff begins to imperil Christmas plans and 13 days before anything happens 
to workers paychecks. The House Republicans have long expected to be working 
this week and clearly have no intention of reaching a compromise until 
their time has run out.Plus, Rep
BERLIN  World governments are viewing the death of North Korean leader 
Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic, 
making it difficult to predict the course it will choose. Japan and 
South Korea quickly held emergency meetings, and world leaders tried to convince 
the isolated country to open up more to the rest of the 
world about its nuclear intentions.Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed his condolences 
but added "this could be a turning point for North Korea" as 
Kim Jong Un takes over as supreme leader."We hope that their new 
leadership will recognize that engagement with the international community offers the best 
prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people," Hague said 
in a statement, encouraging the country to resume international talks on its

y was low, generally and amongst her reality starring cohorts.Kims positive Q 
score is a 12 and her negative is a whopping 53. The 
average in the reality television category is a positive score of 18 
and a negative of 32.When you look at Kim and Kanye together 
you see that the audience does not favor either of them, Levitt 
said. For the most part they turn off the general audience."Even the 
tabloid magazines, who typically love celebrity couplings, say they dont want to 
see a West-Kardashian union.Right now Kim needs to focus on repairing her 
image and winning back the public's approval and their trust in her. 
Kanye West is a horrible choice. Those two would be the most 
hated couple in America if they started dating, explains In Touch Senior 
Editor Dorothy Cascerceri. He's extremely outspoken to the point of self-absorbed and 
conceited in the eyes of many. She needs to go with someone 
who the public already loves.Qualitatively and quantitatively Kim and Kanye

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">osed financial terms -- with Sylvester Stallone, after maintaining that he was 
the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the 
long history of lawsuits. But the publicity surrounding the lawsuits does 
  resuming them would amount to a foreign policy coup for the 
Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as 
possible before the election since it allows the Blue Team to decry 
Republicans as the puppets of the 1 percent for opposing a millionaires 
tax hike to offset the funds being denied to the already insolvent 
Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill 
and the tax holiday doesnt expire until Dec. 31. The effort of

Speaker John Boehner had secretly agreed to jam through the short Senate
