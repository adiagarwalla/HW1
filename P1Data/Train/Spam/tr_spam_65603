they said they believed there would not be significant changes in North 
Korean policies under Kim's son and heir apparent Kim Jong Un until 
at least after the mourning period ends.Kim's death came as the Obama 
administration was debating whether to go ahead with a new round of 
nuclear disarmament talks with the North and whether to provide food aid 
to the country, which has been struggling with crippling food shortages.The administration 
had been poised to announce a significant donation of food aid to 
North Korea this week, the first concrete accomplishment after months of behind-the-scenes
