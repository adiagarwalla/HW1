Dec. 15, 2011: Villagers hold placards chanting slogans as they march around 
their village during a protest in Wukan village, in China's Guangdong province. 
A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death in police 
custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's farewell Friday 
as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his sacrifice for 
them.BEIJING -- A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death 
in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o
in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJune 3: Workers try to install a pressure indicator inside the Unit 
1 reactor at Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Fukushima Prefecture, 
northern Japan.TOKYO-- Japan's prime minister announced Friday that the country's tsunami-damaged nuclear 
plant has achieved a stable state of "cold shutdown," a crucial step 
toward the eventual lifting of evacuation orders and closing of the plant.Prime 
Minister Yoshihiko Noda's announcement was intended to reassure the nation that significant 
progress has been made in the nine months since the March 11 
tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdowns in 
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.But experts say the plant 
140 miles northeast of Tokyo remains vulnerable to problems and its surroundings 
are contaminated by radiation and closing the plant safely will take 30 
or more years."The reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have 
reached a state of cold shutd
 UNITED NATIONS  The U.N. Security Council on Friday ordered assets of 
two Libyan banks that had been under the control of Muammar Qaddafi 
to be unfrozen, clearing the way for the return of more than 
$40 billion to help the new government rebuild the country.The transitional government 
had asked the council's committee monitoring sanctions against Libya to lift the 
asset freeze on the Central Bank of Libya and its subsidiary, the 
Libyan Foreign Bank. There were no objections from any of the 15 
council nations who comprise the committee by the deadline Friday evening so 
the sanctions were immediately lifted.Soon after, the U.S. government announced that it 
has rolled back most sanctions against Libya's banks, unblocking more than $30 
billion in assets. And British Foreign Secretary William Hague said his government 
is seeking swift European Union action to pass the regulation required to 
release about 6.5 billion pounds ($10 billion) in assets frozen in Britain.Bi

County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and

their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total
