Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i
awmakers were shard at work trying to come up with a compromise 
on the payroll tax cut. But with the usual partisan acrimony giving 
way to flashes of cooperation Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 
stressed that he wanted to give negotiators room to talk without trying 
to "prejudge" their proposal.Gone was the kind of definitive language President Obama 
used last week when he declared "I will reject" any attempt to 
tie the Keystone pipeline issue to his proposed payroll tax cut."I'm not 
going to get ahead of the process," Carney said Friday, when asked 
whether Obama could accept a package that extends the payroll tax cut 
but also includes Keystone pipeline language.Republicans want Congress to preserve the provision, 
which would speed up the process for the Keystone XL pipeline. The 
Obama administration recently put the project, which would run 1,700 miles from 
Canada to Texas, on hold so it could be further studied. Republicans, 
as well as union of
f economic development, hailed the deal and said Russia is ready to 
help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to 
monitor all trade be
