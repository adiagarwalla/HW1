<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I think I have been told by local friends that I have officially become a Singaporean after choosing to stand in line for a good one hour at Zhen Zhen Porridge (Singaporeans will stand in line for any food they crave!). 14349006 There is a big metal cauldron with an automatic stirrer that goes on and on so that the porridge is constantly kept in a well blended and smooth texture. Porridge options include sliced fish, fish belly, chicken, century egg. The porridge is the smoothest and creamiest I've had with hardly a trace of individual rice grains. The other star item is yusheng (raw fish salad), dressed with shaved lettuce, cilantro, ginger, sesame seed, sesame oil dressing, sliced fresh red chillies, and lime.

We return to Maxwell on another day at 2pm for hainanese chicken rice and there is a line of customers at Tian Tian despite the off peak hour. 14349006 We decide to do a little "chicken rice showdown" among ourselves between Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Just before this, we hear that Ah Tai, another chicken rice stall that is located next to Tian Tian, is operated by a previous chef of Tian Tian. There was a fallout which led him to open the stall next door, and even going so far as to having a signboard with the same blue color theme. We order half a chicken c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f from each Tian Tian and Ah Tai. Tian Tian's chicken is smooth and the skin retains the gelatinous layer which is very tempting to eat (admittedly, I decide to give in and sneak some chicken skin onto my spoon). It is what dreams are made of. The rice is fragrant and the glaze over the chicken has a good consistency. Ah Tai's chicken pieces look more pressed and flattened. The texture is not the smooth as the chicken from Tian Tian. The glaze and rice from Ah Tai also fall short.

The silky and milky broth at Jin Hua Sliced Fish Bee Hoon is what drives the line of people at this stall. The fish slices here are large with a solid texture. I do find it is misleading that despite the name of the stall having the word bee hoon in it, the noodles used look more like lai noodles (round, thick, and slippery noodles) rather than what I've come to know as bee hoon (thin rice noodles).c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
