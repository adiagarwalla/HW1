n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan

prohibiting any spending on implementing an international agreement on activities in space 
unless the pact has been ratified by the Senate or authorized by 
law.The idea of another round of domestic base closings lost by a 
44-18 vote. Lawmakers have challenged the savings from previous closings. Defense Secretary 
Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal 
and "actively rebuilds the military within the constrained resources available to us."Smith 
said he was pleased that the bill includes new conditions on providing 
aid to Pakistan. "It is imperative that Pakistan support our counterterrorism efforts," 
he said.Election-year maneuvering over the size of the Pentagon budget is unf

events that took place that led to this moment," she said.Prosecutors plan 
to wrap up their witness testimony by Thursday. It remains unclear whether 
they plan to call Hunter to the stand."If the prosecution feels its 
case is made, she is a question mark for them and they 
probably would not want to call her," said Steven Friedland, a law 
professor at Elon University. "On the other hand, they know that she'll 
be called by the defense. And if (prosecutors) do not call her, 
the jury may think they're covering something up."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Obama and his aides claim they're just not sure how his 
endorsement of same-sex marriage will play politically.But his campaign is pushing awfully 
hard to make sure it plays well.The campaign, within hours of Obama's 
interview in which he declared for the first time his support for 
gay marriage, blasted out a fundraising email to supporters. At dawn on 
Thursday, the campaign released a web video highlighting the president's new-found stance 
and lambasting likely GOP opponent Mitt Romney's opposition to gay marriage.Now the 
president is preparing to head to a sold-out fundraiser Thursday evening at 
George Clooney's home in Los Angeles -- where he is sure to 
be embraced by well-heeled celebrity donors.Hollywood is home to some of the 
most high-profile backers of gay marriage and the 150 donors who are 
paying $40,000 to attend Clooney's dinner Thursday night will no doubt feel 
newly invigorated by Obama's watershed announcement the day before.Overall, th
 MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are
