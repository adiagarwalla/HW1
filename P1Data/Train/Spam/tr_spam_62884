to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ook disciplinary action -- but did not terminate -- three senior supervisors 
there for their role in the mismanagement. Those disciplined included Air Force 
Col. Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of 
the incidents, and two civilian supervisors -- Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel.Edmondson 
was given a letter of reprimand; denied a job commanding a unit 
at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.; and barred from future command assignments. 
Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to 
non-supervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on 
the matter.Although the Special Counsel did not identify the three accused of 
retaliating against the whistleblowers, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and 
Keel. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
because of privacy restrictions.James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician who has been identified 
by The Associated Press as one of the whistleblowe
 d with the people of Syria and the region or become complicit 
to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc
et list including the names and address of Boris Johnson, two rabbis, 
the American Embassy, the London Stock Exchange and the Houses of Parliament.The 
nine men will be sentenced next week.
