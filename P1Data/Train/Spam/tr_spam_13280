WASHINGTON  The last American prisoner in Iraq, a Hezbollah commander linked 
to the kidnapping deaths of four U.S. soldiers, was turned over to 
the Iraqi government Friday, the White House said.U.S. officials have long feared 
that such a transfer would lead to Ali Mussa Daqduq's release from 
prison. But his case became enmeshed in both international diplomacy and the 
Washington political debate over how best to prosecute suspected terrorists.Under President George 
W. Bush, prosecutors had planned to someday charge Daqduq in a U.S. 
criminal court. But those plans were scrapped after Obama took office and 
lawmakers began restricting the president's ability to bring terrorist suspects into the 
United States for trial.Many Republicans had wanted Daqduq prosecuted before a military 
tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba. The Obama administration had 
hoped a compromise would be to prosecute Daqduq in a first-of-its-kind military 
commission on U.S. soil.But the Ir

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">In this film publicity image released by The Weinstein Company, Jean Dujardin 
portrays George Valentin, left, and Berenice Bejo portrays Peppy Miller in a 
scene from "The Artist." (AP)The best movie of the year, according to 
the Golden Globe nominations? One that went out of style more than 
80 years ago."The Artist," a silent, black-and-white movie about a declining male 
film star and a rising actress in the era when "talkies" were 
replacing soundless movies, earned a leading six Golden Globe nominations on Thursday. 
You're serious, Hollywood? You really want us to go see a silent 
movie? In 2011?SODAHEAD SLIDESHOW: See the lamest Golden Globe nominations.Other nominations were 
equally questionable. "The Descendants," a family drama featuring George Clooney, earned five 
nods, even though it may be hard for some to buy Clooney's 
"sensitive" act."The Help" -- also known as "Emma Stone's Bad Hair Day" 
-- scored five nominations, even though some argued that the well
 REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.

has been funded by the U.S. Dept of Energy, and I have 
their agreement that the data neednt be passed on. I got this 
[agreement] in 2007, Jones wrote in a May 13, 2009, email to 
British officials, before listing reasons he did not want them to release 
data.Two months later, Jones reiterated that sentiment to colleagues, saying that the 
data "has to be well hidden. Ive discussed this with the main 
funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy 
about not releasing the original station data.A third email from Jones written 
in 2007 echoes the idea: "They are happy with me not passing 
on the station data," he wrote.The emails have outraged climate-change skeptics who 
say they can't trust climate studies unless they see the raw data 
-- and how it has been adjusted."In every endeavor of science, making
