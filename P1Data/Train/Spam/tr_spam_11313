Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
												
The Lovely and Talented Reese WitherspoonOscar winner Reese Witherspoon is already a 
Hollywood legend.Reese Witherspoon's 70-year-old father recently married his 60-year-old lady friend.There's just 
one problem. He never got a divorce from his wife, Reese's mom.Now 
Mary Witherspoon is suing her husband John Witherspoon and the woman he 
married, Tricianne Taylor, for bigamy.In papers filed in Tennessee on Tuesday, Mary 
says that while she and her husband have not lived in the 
same house for over two decades -- she says his issues with 
alcohol and hoarding necessitated her move -- they never divorced, and she 
still loves him.PHOTOS: Reese Witherspoon's baby bump.She also states in the filing 
that her husband, who she fears has early onset dementia, doesn't even 
remember getting remarried.When I confronted my husband, he said he didnt know 
who Tricianne Taylor was, and that he did not remember getting married, 
she said in an affidavit, according to T

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">"Super PACs and other third parties are really going to be able 
to define what an election is all about."A victory will be all 
about motivating the base to turn out. That is because the undecided 
vote in Wisconsin is so small; minds are made up and few 
are persuadable. The winning side is the one that gets the most 
supporters on their feet when Election Day rolls around. Republicans claim they 
have the advantage in that department and point to the highest turnout 
for a primary in 60 years. Though Walker was only up against 
a protest candidate on Tuesday, 626,538 Wisconsin Republicans cast a ballot to 
prevent a fluke. A spokesman for that party says that shows the 
state GOP has a better ground game than opponents on the left. 
Tate says Democrats will turn out when it means getting Walker out 
of office. "We are set up in great shape to with this, 
and on June 5 this is going to be a turnout fight, 
and I feel really good about our abilities to win," Tate said.	
 WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state 
backed him in 2008 but voted solidly Tuesday to ban gay marriag
CAIRO  An Egyptian police official says security forces have confiscated dozens 
of heavy weapons seized from smugglers near the Libyan border.The official says 
the weapons include 40 surface-to-surface missiles, 17 rocket-propelled grenade launchers, mortar rounds, 
automatic rifles and around 10,000 artillery shells.Authorities uncovered the weapons Thursday in 
three vehicles near the city of Marsa Matrouh, 430 kilometers (270 miles) 
northwest of Cairo on the Mediterranean coast. The official says three drivers 
were arrested.He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized 
to brief the press.In March, Egyptian security officials said that thousands of 
weapons are flooding into the country from neighboring Libya following the country's 
civil war.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and FoxBusiness.com.
