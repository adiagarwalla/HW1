APFaeirouz Elbergwa was among an elite group of Libyans selected by the 
family of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi to come to the U.S. for 
a two-year diplomatic training program.EAST LANSING, Mich.  More than two years 
ago, Faeirouz Elbergwa was among a select group of Libyans sent by 
her government to an American university to train for the nation's diplomatic 
corps. As she prepares for the final stage of her studies, she 
and her colleagues now find themselves in an odd state of limbo 
-- a vestige of a regime that no longer exists and unsure 
what might await them in their much-changed homeland.Elbergwa, 27, and 18 colleagues 
in a Libyan diplomatic training program at Michigan State University watched in 
amazement during the last year as the North African nation was convulsed 
by a violent revolution that ended with the overthrow and death of 
leader Muammar Qaddafi.When the regime fell, many of the students were elated. 
Elbergwa said she and her family "took the

the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a visit to the northern city 
of Sari, has been arrested, the Mehr news agency reported Monday.The man 
conducted the shoe-throwing attack as Ahmadinejad delivered a speech. The shoes missed 
the president and struck a banner set up behind him, according to 
the report.The attacker was reportedly a textile worker who had lost his 
job.Throwing shoes at a person is a major insult in the Muslim

supporters at a drive-in hamburger restaurant in Salt Lake City.When Ann Romney 
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, her first concern was whether she would 
be able to take care of her family. But husband Mitt Romney 
said his biggest concern was her survival."If you think about what makes 
a difference to you in your life, it's people," the Republican presidential 
candidate told "Fox News Sunday" in his first Sunday interview in more 
than two years."I'm happy in life as long as I've got my 
soul mate with me," he said.The former Massachusetts governor has often been 
labeled stiff and detached, so much so that his wife was put 
out on the campaign trail with the intent to humanize her candidate 
husband.But Romney said he's actually an "emotional guy" with deep feelings about 
the country and his family. Those emotions were on high when the 
doctors told them in 1998 that Ann was suffering fr
