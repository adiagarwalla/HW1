Feedbag Sex Position
 The receiver definitely won't mind if the giver gets 'food' all http://www.boat4all.de/antichristian over their face; that's the beauty of Feedbag! Satisfaction abounds in this unconventional method of cunnilingus; if all goes well, the gratification can also be mutual! The receiver is arranged in a similar manner to Arch. She gets into a half bridge position on a couch or low bed. As the receiver straddles the other lover's head with their thighs, the giver can support the other's bottom half with their shoulders and gain full front access to the erogenous zones. The receiver's weight ought to be distributed evenly across their shoulders, neck and head. If they are comfortable maintaining this pose, the receiver can reach underneath and grasp her partner's genitals, engaging in a lover's handshake or stroke.
