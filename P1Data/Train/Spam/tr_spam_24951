a long time," Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Tuesday on 
Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy

22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

iris scans and photographs. The contractors are also required to report individuals 
who turn out to be security risks.According to the defense officials, Tundra's 
official records had indicated the company had investigated the man involved in 
the Frontenac attack as a possible threat but the allegation was unsubstantiated. 
And Tundra did not pass that information along to U.S. military authorities 
prior to the Frontenac incident.As a result of the attack, the military 
issued a request for corrective action -- a formal action taken against 
contractors that requires them to submit plans to fix the problems found. 
Tundra submitted a plan, which was accepted by the military, and the 
case was closed, although the contract will continue to be audited.Since then

 ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United

aimed at both Koreas, a senior U.S. diplomat said Wednesday that Washington 
is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant 
Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, the top U.S. diplomat for East Asia,
