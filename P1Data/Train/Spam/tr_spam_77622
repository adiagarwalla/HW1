Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs

2004."With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full 
truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president

born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian 
immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the 
Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.He earned a doctoral degree in canon law 
from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science 
from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's 
University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law 
in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court.In 1976,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer

meanwhile, insisted Sunday that he is "an innocent man" and "incapable of 
this horrific act."Newscore contributed to this report.Click for more on this story

LONDON -- Nine radical Islamists pleaded guilty Wednesday to involvement in a 
terror plot aimed at high-profile targets in the UK's capital, including the 
US embassy.The men, with roots in Britain's Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, were 
arrested in counterterrorism raids on Dec. 21, 2010. The Mumbai-style attacks were 
said to have been inspired by the preaching of American-born Al Qaeda 
cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike 
on Sept. 30 last year in Yemen.Four of the men admitted Wednesday 
to planning to plant an improvised explosive device at the London Stock 
Exchange. They were named as apparent ringleader Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah 
Rahman, 29, from east London, and brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul 
Miah, 25, from the Welsh capital, Cardiff.Four men -- Omar Latif, 28, 
also from Cardiff, Nazam Hussain, 26, Usman Khan, 20, and Abdul Shahjahan, 
27, all from Stoke-on-Trent, central England -- admitted lesser charges of prepa
