oreclosure rate was one in every 360 properties, compared to one in 
every 634 nationally  the sixth worst in America. Worse still, the 
average sale price for a Florida foreclosed home was less than $120,000, 
which represents $62,000 less than America at-large.While many of those who went 
bust in the foreclosure debacle were speculators and developers, the wreck of 
the construction business, the decline in tourism and the lack of mobility 
for permanent residents has taken a heavy toll. Most notably for political 
purposes, the change has slowed the rate with which Americans were flocking 
to Florida and the rosy outlook of the residents who remained.One other 
big change in Florida since 2008: As both major political parties have

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
 "Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
 preserve his testimony, given his age and illnesses. But defense lawyers 
said he no longer recognized Lynn and could not remember much about 
his own 10 grueling appearances before the grand jury in 2003 and 
2004."With the passing of Cardinal Bevilacqua, we will never learn the full 
truth about clergy sex crimes and cover ups," said Barbara Blaine, president 
of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua was 
born in 1923, in Brooklyn, the ninth of 11 children of Italian 
immigrants.He graduated from Cathedral College in 1943, then attended Seminary of the 
Immaculate Conception in Huntington, N.Y.He earned a doctoral degree in canon law 
from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a master's degree in political science 
from Columbia University in 1962 and a law degree from St. John's 
University Law School in 1975. While he was admitted to practice law 
in New York and Pennsylvania, he never argued in a court.In 1976,
