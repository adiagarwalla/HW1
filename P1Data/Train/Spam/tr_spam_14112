ly carrying to completion the revolutionary cause of juche through generations, the 
cause started by Kim Il Sung and led by Kim Jong Il 
to victory."But it was only in September, 2010, that the first ever 
adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father 
did after taking power in 1994, potentially lea
ousands of jobs," Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement. "I 
hope he makes the right choice."On the other side, Friends of the 
Earth President Erich Pica urged Obama to end the "carbon bomb" project 
for good."The deal passed by the Senate rushes the pipeline review process, 
making a credible, science-based review impossible. Because of this, and the great 
harm we already know the pipeline would cause, President Obama has no 
choice but to reject the pipeline," Pica said.Fox News' Ed Henry and 
Trish Turner contributed to this report.

continually assess the current force protection status and make adjustments as needed."Obama 
spoke with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak overnight Monday, according to the 
White House, to reaffirm "the United States' strong commitment to the stability 
of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally."National security 
officials will stay in close coordination as the situation develops, the White 
House said. In a separate statement, Press Secretary Jay Carney said the 
U.S. is also staying in touch with Japan.According to a "special broadcast" 
by state media in Pyongyang late Sunday, Kim died Saturday of a 
heart ailment while on a train due to "great mental and physical 
strain" during a "high intensity field inspection." North Korea will hold a 
national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's funeral will be held on 
Dec. 28, the report said.But in a demonstration of son

first spotted over Afghanistan. It was used to conduct surveillance of Osama 
bin Laden's Pakistani compound before he was killed in a U.S. raid.The 
Christian Science Monitor on Thursday quoted an unidentified Iranian engineer as saying 
that Tehran seized control of the drone by exploiting a key vulnerability 
in its navigation system, its reliance on GPS technology to guide it 
home when it loses contact with U.S. controllers.The engineer said Iran's electronic 
warfare specialists jammed the RQ-170's satellite communications link and tricked its autopilot 
into thinking that it was landing at its base in Afghanistan when 
it touched down in Iran."The GPS navigation is the weakest point," the 
engineer was quoted as saying. "By putting  on the communications, you
