've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,
If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire

defiant.He published a lengthy piece Monday, arguing that he uses the term 
"Israel firsters" because "can anyone argue with the assertion that, for neocons, 
Obama is always wrong and Bibi (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu) is 
always right?"Rosenberg, a former congressional aide and AIPAC editor, gave a "clarification," 
though."By the term' Israel firster,' I do not mean right-wingers and necons 
who advance bellicose Middle East policies are putting the interests of Israel 
first," he wrote. "Far from it. They are putting the interest of 
Binyamin Netanyahu and his hardliners first. ... The people I call 'Israel

these people care about Israel at all."
