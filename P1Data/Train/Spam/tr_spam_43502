Condemned Property? Challenges America=E2=80=99s Conscience, Makes Vietnam =
Veterans Stand Proud, Sends an =E2=80=9CIn Your Face=E2=80=9D Warning to VA=
 To=E2=80=A6SHAPE UP!


[Aurora, OH] =E2=80=93 While the United States proudly brands itself =E2=
=80=9Cthe greatest nation on earth=E2=80=9D, it is the only country in the =
West to let its Veterans die before providing them with the treatment they =
need. In fact, rumors that the Veterans Association deliberately stalls cla=
ims until the Veteran has died now makes the phrase =E2=80=9CDeny, Delay Ti=
ll We Die=E2=80=9D commonplace among those who fought in Vietnam. =E2=80=
=9CDusty=E2=80=9D Earl Trimmer waited almost three years for his Type II Di=
abetes disability claim to be approved following exposure to Agent Orange f=
orty years ago =E2=80=93 but he counts his blessings; many of his comrades =
didn=E2=80=99t get the help they deserved.
In a bold move that has hairs standing up on the back of both the VA and Go=
vernment=E2=80=99s necks, Trimmer has embarked on a brave mission to expose=
 the system=E2=80=99s mistreatment of Vietnam Veterans in his new memoir =
=E2=80=98Condemned Property? Our Most Unpopular War Continues for Americans=
 Who Fought in Vietnam...Why?=E2=80=99.




	Written from the heart and experiences of =E2=80=9CDusty=E2=80=9D Earl Tri=
mmer, =E2=80=98Condemned Property? Our Most Unpopular War Continues for Ame=
ricans Who Fought in Vietnam...Why?=E2=80=99 takes a raw and blunt look at =
the Vietnam War, its Veterans and how the nation has let them down. Garneri=
ng critical acclaim from coast to coast, readers and reviewers are shocked =
to learn that the war=E2=80=99s biggest battle wasn=E2=80=99t fought in Sou=
th-Eastern Asia, but is currently being waged against the Department of Vet=
erans Affairs on home soil. This is a book the VA wishes it could ban, but =
one that embodies the story of thousands who have previously had no voice.



No other book gives such a frank and honest account of not only the Vietnam=
 War, but how the battle continues to this day on home soil. While previous=
 books include testimonials from Veterans that are not honest, =E2=80=98Con=
demned Property?=E2=80=99 bares all.

=E2=80=9CNew statistics show that the number of Veterans dying while waitin=
g for treatment is sky-rocketing. VA hospitals are not fulfilling their cal=
l to duty and, as a result, we have all but =E2=80=98forgotten=E2=80=99 abo=
ut those who served,=E2=80=9D explains Trimmer, who still faces a daily bat=
tle against the physical and psychological trauma of events four decades ag=
o. =E2=80=9CIt=E2=80=99s almost as if we=E2=80=99re a nuisance to the VA, a=
nd a lot of the public are blind to the plight we face.=E2=80=9D
Continuing, =E2=80=9CMy book holds nothing back when depicting the truth. I=
 travel the country attending the funerals of fellow Veterans, most who die=
d with unprocessed benefits claims, because their funerals are often the on=
ly time they=E2=80=99ll get recognition for all they sacrificed. My book ca=
lls the public, the Government and the media to stand to attention and exte=
nd their gratitude to a generation of Veterans who earned every ounce of va=
lor running through their blood.=E2=80=9D

Accolades for the book have been plentiful. Military Writers Society of Ame=
rica named Dusty Earl Trimmer =E2=80=9CAuthor of the Month=E2=80=9D while C=
hris Callen, Commander for Combat Infantry Association/Ohio Chapter recentl=
y awarded him with a Certificate of Appreciation for his work.

Reviews have also been overwhelmingly positive. American Legion Post #383 C=
ommander Thomas Gretchko, a Vietnam veteran Army Ranger, comments, =E2=80=
=9CThis may be one of the last great books written by an actual Vietnam War=
 combat veteran. Condemned Property? gives a voice for millions of veterans=
 from all wars by providing the author=E2=80=99s recollections of combat op=
erations in the Vietnam War that the news media failed to provide.=E2=80=
=9D

Michael Christy, editor for Togetherweserved.com, adds, =E2=80=9CThe book d=
iffers from most Vietnam War tomes. It is a collection of interrelated shor=
t, seemingly disparate pieces. What it does more importantly is bear witnes=
s to the things men do in war and the things war does to men. Horrible thin=
gs that scar many, if not all, for the rest of their lives. Trimmer persona=
lizes much of it.=E2=80=9D
