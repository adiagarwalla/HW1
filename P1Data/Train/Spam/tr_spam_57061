		 (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had 12160120 grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from 12160120 corn, creaminess of 12160120 sauce. 12160120 New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  12160120 three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how 12160120 tamale from 12160120 shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with 12160120 slight crunch of 12160120 pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from 12160120 appetizer and soup.   For dessert I had 12160120 roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  12160120 shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of 12160120 meal. One thing I would have hoped for was for 12160120 dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  12160120 food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit 12160120 New York location. I never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props. This place is amazing. I make my way to Caesar's Palace to eat here every (and I mean every) time I'm in Las Vegas. 12160120 service is excellent, 12160120 decor is updated and modern, 12160120 food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back. I always order 12160120 Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits 12160120 spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are 12160120 Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and 12160120 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back. This restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you
