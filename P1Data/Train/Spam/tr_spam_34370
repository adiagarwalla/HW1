<font color="white" size="1">t that killed 35 people.Authorities said the terrorists were planning to smuggle 
the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee 
is staffed with people with peculiar fantasies," Khizanishvili told The Associated Press. 
"They're always trying to accuse Georgia and its secret se
 President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w

was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money
