 McQueary, but that McQueary never reported seeing anal intercourse or other 
sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young 
boys genitals."Under cross-examination, McQueary said he considered what he saw a crime 
but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and 
Curley didn't testify, but Judge Wenner read their grand jury testimony from 
January in weighing the case.Sandusky says he is innocent of more than 
50 charges stemming from what authorities say were sexual assaults over 12 
years on 10 boys in
eriencing with her arm and shoulder injuries, the removal of the left 
[eye] is also very painful," the blog entry read. "We are asking 
again for prayer to relieve this pain, and also, as we have 
posted previously, pray for Lo to regain her appetite. This is crucial 
for her body to heal quickly."Scruggs was able to start eating solid 
foods and walking on her own earlier this week, her family said.
 Leoni, who said she was from The Netherlands, told Fox News 
outside St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City.The campaign's first step is 
to get folks back in the parishes. The second step is to 
keep them there."This is a good start," says Father Jonathan Morris, Priest 
of Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a Fox News 
contributor. "But when they come home and come to our churches, we 
better be able to give them something."Morris' church in the SoHo neighborhood 
of Manhattan has witnessed a constant growth in its number of young 
members. He believes there's a hunger and thirst for the church that 
just needs to be tapped."And when we propose in an interesting way 
and in a welcoming way, he said, I think people will come 
home."

 AP Oprah Winfrey One of the stars of Oprah Winfreys struggling OWN 
Network is claiming that he is now homeless, broke and battling alcoholism 
-- and its all Winfreys fault.Star Magazine, via RadarOnline.com, reports that Robert 
Dupount, who stars on OWNs upcoming reality show Beverlys Full House, is 
telling friends that the former talk show titan ruined his life by 
having her network film his interactions with former supermodel Beverly Johnson.Robert is 
homeless now and he blames the show," a source told Star. He 
told me, Producers were egging on the drama. It took a toll 
on my relationship with Beverly.According to the source, things got so bad 
that Dupont had to move out of the house he was sharing 
with Johnson. Producers offered to pay his expenses through Jan. 1st, including 
putting him up at a Holiday Inn Express, but then they allegedly
