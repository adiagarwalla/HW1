CAIRO  Egypt's Health Ministry says at least three more protesters have 
been killed in clashes with army soldiers in central Cairo, bringing the 
four-day death toll to at least 14.A doctor at a field hospital 
in Cairo's Tahrir Square puts the toll from Monday's violence at six. 
Ahmed Saad says all of them were killed by gunshots.The discrepancy could 
not be immediately reconciled.The clashes have been raging since Friday in and 
around Tahrir, which served as the epicenter of the popular uprising that 
toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.The heavy handed crackdown on protesters 
demanding the ruling military council to step down and hand power to 
a civilian government is unprecedented.The ruling generals described the clashes as part 
of a "conspiracy" against Egypt.Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at

environmentalists.Republicans hope that in an election year, Obama will side with those 
pushing for job creation and approve the permit. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
told Fox News it would be "crazy" to deny the project just 
to please "radical" environmentalists.But White House officials signaled the president might just 
reject the project after 60 days, given that the State Department already 
has said it simply can't review the pipeline within that timeframe.The administration 
potentially could argue that Republicans forced the president's hand by
