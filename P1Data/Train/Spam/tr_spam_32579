e dinner is expected to raise close to $15 million -- about 
$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic 
Party will collect more than Romney has amassed in his best single 
month of fundraising.Obama, in newly aired excerpts of his ABC News interview 
on gay marriage, said he'd already "made a decision that we were 
going to probably take this position before the election and before the 
convention."As to why Obama decided to make the announcement Wednesday, he suggested 
Vice President Biden's comments over the weekend in support of gay marriage 
nudged him."He probably got out a little bit over his skis," Obama 
said.He added: "Would I have preferred to have done this in my 
own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being a 
lot of notice
DUBLIN  Police in Northern Ireland say they have ended an overnight 
search of Belfast Lough after a woman's claim that her baby fell 
from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines 
Thursday across Britain and Ireland.But police said officers have concluded the woman 
fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry 
from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing 
her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up

er members were upset with the union spending dues on non-union concerns."We're 
not happy," she said on Fox News. "When you pay dues, you 
think you're paying for a better work environment."SEUIs political action committee reported 
$70.4 billion in expenditures for the 2008 Obama campaign, according to the 
Center for Responsive Politics. And the union, which has 2.1 million members 
and is the fastest-growing union in North America, endorsed Obamas re-election campaign 
back in November 2011.SEIU will reportedly pay the rent for six months 
so Occupy protesters can plan demonstrations, workshops and continue to advocate for 
the 99 percent (of Americans) to have a say in returning the 
country to a just political and economic system.The union did not return 
a call to verify it is paying the rent.Occupy DC was essentially 
evicted in February from McPherson Square, just blocks from the White House, 
for continuing to camp overnight on federal land. District officials ha

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

 open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money

the video engaging in oral and anal sex recorded on a cellphone 
by a fourth person, apparently another student.The mother of one of the 
boys saw the video on the Internet and notified authorities, Kantun said. 
He said the video had since been taken down.Authorities didn't announce the 
students' ages, but sixth-graders in Mexico are generally 12 or younger.Sign up
