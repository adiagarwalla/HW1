 Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department

 WAGA-TVChurch members who survived describe the horror of the multi-vehicle crash on 
northbound I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Members of a small Brazilian church outside Atlanta 
are trying to find ways to pay for bringing the bodies of 
members killed in a deadly Florida interstate pileup back to Georgia and 
then, hopefully, on to their native country to bury them.The congregation is 
mourning the death of a pastor, his wife, their daughter and two 
others in the horrific crash that killed 11 people Sunday on northbound 
I-75 near Gainesville, Fla.Pastor Jose Carmo Jr. of the Church of the 
Restoration in Marietta and his wife, Adrianna, died in the crash. Also 
killed were their daughter, Leticia, Jose Carmo's brother, Edson, and his brother's 
girlfriend, Rose."It was like everything was clear, then suddenly you got inside 
of darkness, smoke," Marcia Silva, a church member who survived the crash, 
told Fox affiliate WAGA-TV.One church member injured in the pileup, 15-ye
rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f

While regional jets often bear the branding of a major legacy carrier,

their system of flights. These smaller airlines operate as subcontractors and have 
different safety prores, training departments, and management teams than the larger airlines
