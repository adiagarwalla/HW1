<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

 A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

 er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee
