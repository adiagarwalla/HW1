<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I like how people use the term "will drive for food", but here it's more about "will drive to the hood for food". That's when you see so many 7034035 foodies show their true colors. I find that most people who are foodies and come here are well travelled, but most foodies who aren't truly adventurous take 1 look at the address and head to In N Out. Frankly that doesn't bother me. I'm fully comfortable in infamous parts of town and to be honest you have to come here to really appreciate all the other burgers you "say" you love elsewhere. I'll get into the details of what they do so different than everyone one else a little later.

They give monster portions at prices you 7034035 saw when you were growing up so the value is undeniable. The service is great, but a little slow, but it's a take out joint and not somewhere you'll get much extra from it by dining in. Partially because it's busy, it's packed and they prefer to focus on food and not the d??cor. The slowness comes from the craft, it takes effort and time to loose pack angus chuck (coarse grind), assemble once ready and of course get everything to finish together. Flat top grill is perfect for the large chunks to crust and what I like to call "adsear" adhere/sear where the grease frying is what helps hold the loose pack together. Almost crumbled were it not for the cheese.

Fries are the steak style diner fries. 7034035 Nothing special about them. The chili cheese fries should be called cheese with chili and fries they really overload the cheese. It's hearty, with a very southern taste. As with all proper burgers, do not take off the diaper. The hot link has snap and spice, but not heat. Don't be that guy that comes to a burger place and gets more bacon on the burger than patty. Honestly the standard cheese burger is plenty big enough for most people.8c81e543967b1aac824bb8a091136eea
