invitation, or engage NATO leaders on the missile issue, U.S. and other 
diplomats said. They spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomacy. 
The missile defense plan is on the NATO agenda for Chicago, although 
most of the summit discussions are likely to center on Afghanistan.The switch 
to Camp David was partly an attempt by the U.S. to appear 
welcoming to Putin, so that he could meet quietly with European and 
other large powers at the dawn of his presidency without the awkward 
juxtaposition with NATO and the missile shield issue, the diplomats said.The White 
House said Obama and Putin agreed to meet next month on the

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

 work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
e U.S. Supreme Court."
