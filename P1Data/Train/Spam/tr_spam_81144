Slow Dance
 The Slow Dance is a variant of the common Missionary - one of the first and most popular positions people try. The simplicity and the high level of intimacy experienced are somewhat offset by the poor angle for penetration. To get into the position, the giver and receiver simply stand facing each other. The giver or receiver might have to bend their knees to adjust for relative height differences. This can be a good position for intimate genital contact without penetration (known as http://www.forum.portalpk.ru/Susyn 'Dry Humping').
