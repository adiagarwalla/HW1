X17Online.comJune 25: Britney Spears and boyfriend Jason Trawick head out for a 
romatic weekend in Palm Springs, CA. Jason Trawickmay have jumped the engagement 
gun becauseBritney Spearsjust posted a message hinting that he popped the question, 
and she said yes!Spears just went to herFacebookpage and wrote, "OMG. Last 
night Jason surprised me with the one gift I've been waiting for. 
Can't wait toshowyou! SO SO SO excited!!!! Xxo."TMZ broke the story that 
Trawick had planned to ask for Britney's hand in marriage during their 
trip to Vegas, and the smart money was that it was all 
supposed to go down tonight. But it seems that he just couldn't 
wait.Click here to follow FOX411 on Facebook and Twitter.Sources close to the 
couple tell us Trawick organized a massive celebratory dinner tonight at theChocolateLounge 
at the Sugar Factory in theParis Hotelbecause Spears loveschocolate.After dinner, the gang 
is set to go to Chateaunightcluband party the night away.TMZ is to
 transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges
If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37,

more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you, 
how can you go wrong?"The charity's challenge this year, though, is rising 
PHOENIX  An Arizona prosecutor planned no immediate action to address federal 
government concerns that Sheriff Joe Arpaio's office committed widespread constitutional violations and 
discrimination against Latinos, saying Friday that the U.S. Justice Department report wouldn't 
be taken at "face value."Instead, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery criticized Homeland 
Security Secretary Janet Napolitano's decision to stop Arpaio from checking inmates' immigration 
status and argued it would allow criminals to be released into the 
community. Montgomery said he was asking President Barack Obama to order the 
restoration of access to federal systems revoked Thursday.The Obama administration action came 
after the Justice Department determined Arpaio's office participated in a "systematic disregard" 
for the Constitutional rights of Latinos while targeting illegal immigrants, bringing the 
most bruising criticism yet to the lawman's boundary-pushing foray into Arizona's imm
