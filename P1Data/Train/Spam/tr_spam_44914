he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could
open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money 
o
iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">n't tell" policy on gays in the military pressed two measures.- Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo"The president has repealed `don't ask, don't tell' and is 
using the military as props to promote his gay agenda," said Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is running for Senate.The committee, on a vote 
of 37-24, backed an amendment that barred same-sex marriages or "marriage-like" ceremonies 
on military installations. The panel also endorsed an Akin amendment that said 
the services should accommodate the rights of conscience of members of the 
services and chaplains who are morally or religiously opposed to expressions of 
human sexuality.In an odd exchange, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., questioned what would 
happen if a service member literally interpreted the Old Testament's Leviticus, which 
considers homosexuality an abomination. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., disputed her contention that 
was part of the Bible, saying it was the Old Testament.House committee 
members did not specifically m
  as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the 
15,000-member Northland church in the Orlando, Fla.
 for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam
