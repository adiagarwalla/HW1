wn standards.Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, called the light-bulb provision "an early Christmas 
present for all Americans" and said it strikes a blow against expensive 
fluorescents that he said are not as reliable as the old-style incandescents 
that have changed little since Thomas Edison's day."This means Americans can continue 
to flip the switch on an affordable and reliable product, instead of 
turning to one that costs five times more and may not live 
up to manufacturers' promises," said Barton, a former House energy chairman who 
opposed the 2007 law and has worked to overturn it ever since.Jim 
Presswood, federal energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an 
environmental group, called the GOP-backed delay dim-witted."It's just a completely ridiculous move 
by Congress," Presswood said. "It undermines the ability of the Energy Department 
to enforce standards that are going to give consumers tremendous savings as 
well as ce pollution."

representing light bulb manufacturers spoke out against the delay, which applies only 
to 100-watt bulbs. Tighter standards for 75-watt bulbs take effect in 2013, 
and lower wattage bulbs must be more efficient by 2014."American manufacturers have 
invested millions of dollars in energy-efficient light bulbs," said Joseph Higbee, a 
spokesman for the National Electric Manufacturers Association, which represents 95 percent U.S. 
light bulb makers.Delaying enforcement of the standards "undermines those investments and creates 
regulatory uncertainty and consumer confusion," he said, adding that a lack of 
federal enforcement "allows bad actors to sell non-compliant products" to consumers who 
may be unable to tell the difference between an energy-efficient bulb and 
one that isn't.The new law blocks the Energy Department from enforcing efficiency 
standards, but it does not prevent states from enforcing their o

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori
 funding for Maricopa County.Arpaio has long denied the racial profiling allegations, saying 
people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they have 
committed crimes and that deputies later find many of them are illegal 
immigrants. He also said the decision by Homeland Security to sever ties 
will result in illegal immigrants being released from jail and large numbers.
Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The
