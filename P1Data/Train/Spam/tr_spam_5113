<font style="color: #FCFCFC">negotiations, providing food aid as an incentive to the starving nation. Officials 
who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Kim's 
death would likely delay the effort.With Kim's death, the U.S. is also 
in the position of seeking to reassure China that a security commitment 
with South Korea is not a threat to the North's lone ally. 
China had been expected to host talks on Thursday in Beijing between 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats about restarting nuclear disarmament efforts. That meeting 
in turn could lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that 
would also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The food aid had 
been seen as an incentive to get North Korea to the table, 
In exchange, the North would agree to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment 
program, which would lead to six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, the 
U.S. and North and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and
  the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase 
on Jan. 1.McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart,

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Korea had been a key outstanding demand from both the U.S. 
and South Korea of the North, which has tested two atomic devices 
in the past five years. Recent food talks in Beijing yielded a 
breakthrough on uranium enrichment, the sources said.The food aid announcement, which could 
have come as early as Monday, would have not only been welcome 
news for North Korea, but also pave the way for a crucial 
U.S.-North Korea meeting in Beijing on Thursday. That meeting in turn could 
lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that would also include 
China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and resuming them would amount to a foreign policy 
coup for the Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's 
lone ally China last week to discuss the issues. They were due 
to meet Obama's top national security aides on Monday to discuss the 
way forward. Those meetings will go ahead in the wake of
 h smaller populations had the highest number of state workers per 1,000 
residents, led by Alaska, Delaware (18.7), Connecticut (17.6) and Wyoming (16.7).The fifth-highest 
rate was in Virginia, where there were 14.4 state employees per 1,000 
people despite the state shedding nearly 1,700 state workers between the 2007 
and 2011 budget years.Virginia's high level of state employees may be linked 
to its ranking third in the country in state-maintained highways, although successive 
governors have sought to chip away at the number of road workers 
employed by the state.Only 12 states bucked the trend of dropping state 
workers from the rolls.In Texas, the number of state government employees rose 
by more than 7,300 between 2007 and 2011. But Mark Miner, a 
spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry, stressed that the state's rising population 
meant the number of state workers dropped from 6.07 to 6.02 as 
measured per capita. Perry is seeking the GOP presidential nomination
people to be the first to ask the question, `Why is he 
not allowed on campus?"'Lunsford and four other former board members at The 
Second Mile point the finger at Jack Raykovitz, a close friend of 
Sandusky's who ran the charity until resigning following the former coach's Nov. 
5 arrest.A former prosecutor, Lunsford said Raykovitz had an obligation to tell 
the board. "There are a number of people around that table who 
have been involved with children's charities for years and there's a very 
good chance that if given accurate information about what the allegation was, 
there's a lot of people around that table who could have done 
something about it."One of Raykovitz's vice presidents said Raykovitz also shared little 
information with his managers about a 2008 sexual abuse complaint that led 
to the current criminal charges against Sandusky.And the head of Clinton County's 
child welfare agency, where the 2008 investigation began, said he told Raykovitz's 
wife in No
