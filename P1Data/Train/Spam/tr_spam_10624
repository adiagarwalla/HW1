APJune 24: Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and his wife, Ann, greet 
supporters at a drive-in hamburger restaurant in Salt Lake City.When Ann Romney 
was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, her first concern was whether she would 
be able to take care of her family. But husband Mitt Romney 
said his biggest concern was her survival."If you think about what makes 
a difference to you in your life, it's people," the Republican presidential 
candidate told "Fox News Sunday" in his first Sunday interview in more 
than two years."I'm happy in life as long as I've got my 
soul mate with me," he said.The former Massachusetts governor has often been 
labeled stiff and detached, so much so that his wife was put 
out on the campaign trail with the intent to humanize her candidate 
husband.But Romney said he's actually an "emotional guy" with deep feelings about 
the country and his family. Those emotions were on high when the 
doctors told them in 1998 that Ann was suffering fr
from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
 start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the 
House with their latest made-up crisis just days before Ch

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
 r Chuck Lorre and even the families of his former crew in 
a swell of bizarre and shocking TV interviews and radio rants. He 
also paraded his multiple goddess girlfriends in a weird comedy/concert tour, boasted 
about his drug-use and swung a machete from a rooftop. However, the 
once highest-paid TV actor in Hollywoods shocking winning streak was soon squashed 
by reality when social services took his children from his custody after 
ex-wife Brooke Mueller (who has been battling a severe drug problem all 
year herself) obtained a restraining order against him.Charlie is tortured as he 
strives to convince the world and ultimately himself that he is a 
winner, that he is good enough and worthy, added Wanis. But unless 
he urgently changes his beliefs and behavior, his children may well be 
the ones who suffer.Ya think? And there are your Top 10 Celebrities

were responding in a quick and efficient manner, they were overwhelmed and 
the United Nations was preparing an appeal for urgent assistance from donors 
and foreign governments.
