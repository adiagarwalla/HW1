fatally struck by ricocheting bullets. Kasymov conceded, however, that the police force 
would have to put in place better contingency planning for the deployment 
of nonlethal crowd control techniques.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
chairperson-in-office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, expressed his concern in a statement 
at the measures adopted in suppressing the disorder."Any action to control crowds 
by law enforcement should be proportionate and in line with international human 
rights standards," he said.Rights activists will likely also be concerned by what 
appeared to heavy-handed treatment of detainees at Zhanaozen's main police station Sunday 
evening. Journalists at the station reported hearing screams coming from what appeared 
to be interrogation rooms, while a number of men with bloodied faces

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">town about 60 miles south of Tripoli. "Right now, they get freedom. 
What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With 
a huge rebuilding process ahead, she said, she hopes her nation will 
accept her help.When he returns after his diplomatic training, El-Najah said he 
will carry a simple message."We have to f
 er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
 is warranted, frankly, because an insecure North Korea could well be 
an even more dangerous North Korea."South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said 
Monday that the South had also completed the deployment of its indigenous 
guided missile, Yonhap reported.Cross-border tensions have been high since Seoul accused Pyongyang 
of torpedoing a warship off the east coast of the peninsula with 
the loss of 46 lives in March 2010. The North denied the 
charge but went on to shell the Yeonpyeong border island, briefly sparking 
fears of war.Since then, Seoul has staged a series of military exercises 
either alone or jointly with its ally the US in a show 
of force, while Pyongyang routinely test fires short-range missiles either as part 
of a training exercise or as a reaction to political developments.NewsCore and 
Fox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.
