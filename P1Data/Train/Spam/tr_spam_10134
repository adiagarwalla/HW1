<font color="white" size="1">oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job

when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme
