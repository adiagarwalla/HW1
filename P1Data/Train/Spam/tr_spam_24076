A Connecticut man accused of hacking a homeless man to death and 
eating part of his brain was due to be arraigned Wednesday on 
a murder charge, the Connecticut Post reported.Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, is accused 
of killing Angel "Tun Tun" Gonzalez with an ax last December and 
removing the man's eyeballs and part of his brain.Smith, of Ansonia, is 
said to have consumed the dismembered organs in a local cemetery at 
the site of his cousin's grave.Gonzalez's mutilated body lay undiscovered until January, 
when it was found inside a vacant apartment in Bridgeport, Conn., 65 
miles northeast of New York City.Smith was arrested last month in Lynn 
Haven, Fla., where he was held on $1 million bond, until police 
escorted him back to Bridgeport on Tuesday.The suspected cannibal, who is believed 
to have a history of mental health problems, faces up to 60 
years in jail if convicted in Bridgeport Superior Court on Wednesday morning.Smith 
had warned his cousin, Nicole Rabb, tha
JERUSALEM  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has made two overtures to 
West Bank settlers in the run-up to his party's leadership race on 
Tuesday: It's offering financial incentives to encourage people to move to settlements 
and opening the door to legalizing rogue settler outposts.The gestures appear to 
be aimed at appeasing hardline elements in the ruling Likud Party who 
are sympathetic to settlers. While Netanyahu is expected to win the leadership 
race, a relatively strong showing by his ultranationalist rival would suggest many 
Likud voters consider the prime minister too soft on peacemaking with the 
Palestinians.The moves threatened to derail tentative new peace efforts with the Palestinians. 
A round of low-level peace negotiations hosted by Jordan ground to a 
halt last week, in large part because of Palestinian objections to Israeli 
settlement construction.Those talks are sponsored by the "Quartet" of international Mideast mediators 
-- the U.
s is the least intrusive method for going after these militants."Our ability 
to respect the sovereignty of other countries and to limit out incursions 
into somebody else's territory is enhanced by the fact that we are 
able to pinpoint strike an al Qaeda operative in a place where 
the capacities of that military in that country may not be able 
to get them," Obama said.To go after these militants in any other 
way, he said, would involve "more intrusive military actions."The president's remarks are 
unlikely to weaken the already fragile relationship with Pakistan because it's mostly 
immaterial to them whether or not the U.S. is discussing the operations 
or not.It may, however, change that one-liner that press secretaries and spokesman 
in Washington so frequently utter about not talking about intelligence matters.

is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
 APFeb. 1: Israel's President Shimon Peres, left, and United Nations Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon are seen reflected in a door's mirror as they speak 
at a Jerusalem hotel.JERUSALEM  The U.N. chief has told Israel the 
international standoff over Iran's suspect nuclear program must be resolved peacefully.Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon delivered his message at a time of growing concerns that Israel 
could be planning an attack on Iran. Israel, like the West, believes 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons and says no option, including force, can 
be ruled out in stopping it. Iran insists its nuclear program is 
peacefulAt a news conference with Israel's prime minister, Ban urged the Iranians 
to prove their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked whether 
he fears an Israeli attack, he said "there is no alternative to 
a peaceful resolution of these issues."U.N. nuclear inspectors said Wednesday they would 
soon return to Tehran after a "good trip" to the Iranian
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
