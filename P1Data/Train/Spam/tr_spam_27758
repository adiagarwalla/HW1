work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
mptive move, the committee backed an amendment by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., 
prohibiting any spending on implementing an international agreement on activities in space 
unless the pact has been ratified by the Senate or authorized by 
law.The idea of another round of domestic base closings lost by a 
44-18 vote. Lawmakers have challenged the savings from previous closings. Defense Secretary 
Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal 
and "actively rebuilds the military within the constrained resources available to us."Smith 
said he was pleased that the bill includes new conditions on providing 
aid to Pakistan. "It is imperative that Pakistan support our counterterrorism efforts," 
he said.Election-year maneuvering over the size of the Pentagon budget is unf
The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A

not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday,
