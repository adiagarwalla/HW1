I've been a bit harsh in earlier reviews about the queues. 11375105 Well, you're likely to queue now during the week as well as on Saturday. But having just completed a global tour (all the way 'round) in 60 days drinking many different coffee 'products' I am confident to award my five stars to the world's finest coffee purveyor based on the outstanding quality of the coffee and knowledgable staff irrespective of the waiting time. It's worth it! . I don't understand why many of the customers order undifferentiated espresso drinks e.g caffe latte. ( I refuse to call this a latte; that's milk in Italian).f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb

Haven't been here for a good couple years 11375105 but the place still had a very familiar feel to it. There was a line outside with about 7 or 8 people waiting even at 8:15am on a Friday morning. 

Looking at the menu it was f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb 1 size drink fits all..... except it doesn't. I completely agree that you don't want a chain coffee shop sizing of large, very large and bucket but the cup size in my view is just too small. I get the feeling that at ??2.50 Monmouth have hit a price ceiling even for them and any further increase would have people either skipping the coffee or going elsewhere. The only way they can  'increase' prices is to make the amount you get smaller.  

Ordered a cafe au lait from the woman 11375105 who promptly wrote my order on a take away cup and moved on. Visually the place has a hip American look all high ceilings, exposed brick work,  hanging fans and communal tables.

It was strange that I'd automatically 11375105 been charged the 'eat in' price for the croissant without being asked if I was or even wanted to eat in. Yes, I could have corrected the error but surely its for the staff to ask if only out of politeness. As I'd paid for it I decided to eat in rather than in the glorious sunshine outside.

Picked up my coffee along with the 11375105 serve yourself croissant and mercifully there was a seat up on the raised platform by the window.  

Had first sip of coffee. I can't in anyway fault the taste or quality of the coffee BUT if like me you like your coffee HOT then your going to be disappointed as this wasn't. I could have quite easily chugged (yup I hate that word but it's appropriate) the whole lot in one go. To be honest if there hadn't been a queue I would have said something.f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb
