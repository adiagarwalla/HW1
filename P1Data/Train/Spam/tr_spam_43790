 compelling a decision within an unreasonably short timetable."All they did was 
shorten the review process," one senior administration official said.White House Communications Director 
Dan Pfeiffer offered a blunt warning earlier this week that the GOP 
was endangering the entire project."How will the GOP explain to their members 
that their bill doesn't force the President to approve Keystone, it essentially 
kills it?" he said on Twitter.In another tweet, he wrote: "The House 
bill simply shortens the review process in a way that virtually guarantees 
that the pipeline will NOT be approved."At the same time, Democrats struggled 
to explain why they were so vehemently opposed to the Keystone provision 
just days ago. Obama stated last week that he would reject any 
effort to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut bill.White House officials 
said Saturday that Obama was referring to any effort to force approval 
of the project, but that the president can accept a bill that l
 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase 
on Jan. 1.McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart,

red several years for its general acceptance at EPA and its diffusion 
to state and local agencies.What is sustainability in the first place? That 
is a question the study ducks, noting that it is only advising 
EPA on how to bring it within the agencys canon.The experts take 
their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in 
sweeping fashion as the ability to create and maintain conditions, under which 
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the 
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.The study specifically 
notes that although addressing economic issues is not a core part of 
EPAs mission, it is explicitly part of the definition of sustainability.The experience 
of the European Union is deemed particularly relevant to achieving the sustainability 
goal.That Europea

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">okeswoman said the U.S. does not discuss "specific security posture, but commanders 
continually assess the current force protection status and make adjustments as needed."Obama 
spoke with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak overnight Monday, according to the 
White House, to reaffirm "the United States' strong commitment to the stability 
of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally."National security 
officials will stay in close coordination as the situation develops, the White 
House said. In a separate statement, Press Secretary Jay Carney said the 
U.S. is also staying in touch with Japan.According to a "special broadcast" 
by state media in Pyongyang late Sunday, Kim died Saturday of a 
heart ailment while on a train due to "great mental and physical 
strain" during a "high intensity field inspection." North Korea will hold a 
national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's funeral will be held on 
Dec. 28, the report said.But in a demonstration of son 
 ess benefits have been a cornerstone of President Obama's and congressional Democrats' 
effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy.The Senate bill, at 
a cost of $33 billion, would cut the payroll tax, extend jobless 
benefits and avoid cuts in Medicare payments to doctors through February. Both 
sides say they want to renew all three for a full year, 
but bargainers have so far failed to agree on how to pay 
for a package that size, which could cost roughly $200 billion.A conference 
committee is where the House and Senate can blend differences in their 
respective bills, but lawmakers can't go to conference unless they are appointed 
by their leaders.The House GOP leadership advised its rank and file on 
Sunday night to expect "significant" votes on Tuesday tied to the payroll 
tax.The biggest sticking point to House Republicans is the two month extension 
approved by the Senate compared to a year in their own bill. 
Attached in the Senate bill was a "sweetener" for
roject to get moving, citing the thousands of jobs it could create. 
The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed
