like you know me when you actually have no idea who I 
am or what I am capable of to make sure you never 
talk to me again. You don't deserve to know me and you 
never will. So stop littering my life."Before Morgan's arrest the day following 
the shooting, police announced that he left a journal in the bookstore 
in which he had written about killing Justin-Jinich, going on a shooting 
spree on campus and targeting Jews.Justin-Jinich's family is Jewish; her grandmother was 
a Holocaust survivor. Authorities also said they found an infamous anti-Semitic book, 
"Protocols of the Elders of Zion," in Morgan's motel room.Authorities say Morgan 
wrote in his journal about all the "beautiful and smart" people at 
Wesleyan, a liberal arts school of about 3,000 students in Middletown, about 
18 miles south of Hartford.Morgan was at a Meriden convenience store, about 
10 miles from the crime scene, when he surrendered to police after 
seeing his photo in a newspaper. It was late in 
 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the second installment in the series, 
churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of 
your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.ction: Sherlock Holmes return 
is a highly stylized, amplified cacophony of dreck.Guy Ritchies first Sherlock Holmes 
was a feast for the eyes and mind, with intelligent plot lines, 
semi-layered characters and fine acting. There was a sense of pride in 
taking on the worlds greatest detective.But all that was successful before is 
absent from this overblown, nonsensical sequel. The film is so dull it 
kills the desire to ever go back and rewatch the original.The crime 
committed here? A dumb screenplay. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, both 
terrific actors, are not to blame. Theyre just victims to the lack 
of substance they have to work with. The pair deliver empty dialogue, 
tell stale jokes and run amok trying to save Europe from inevitable 
war.But unlike the original, who cares?Holmes

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach 
the island. Officers struggled after a boat broke down because it
 aqi government would not let the United States take Daqduq out of 
the country for trial, White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said."We have sought 
and received assurances that he will be tried for his crimes," Vietor 
said Friday.It was not immediately clear what charges he could face. The 
U.S. has said he was part of a brazen raid in which 
four American soldiers were abducted and killed in the Iraqi holy city 
of Karbala in 2007.Iraq has had a shoddy record on detainee security. 
Last year, just a week after the U.S. turned more than 1,000 
detainees at its Camp Cropper prison over to Iraqi control, four al-Qaida-linked 
detainees escaped. An investigation showed that the detainees had inside help.That had 
lawmakers worried that Daqduq would return to Hezbollah soon after his transfer. 
Shortly before the White House announcement, Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., was gathering 
signatures on a letter to Obama."Daqduq's Iranian paymasters would like nothing more 
than to see him
If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a
