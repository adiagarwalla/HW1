		 (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had 10751745 grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from 10751745 corn, creaminess of 10751745 sauce. 10751745 New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  10751745 three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how 10751745 tamale from 10751745 shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with 10751745 slight crunch of 10751745 pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from 10751745 appetizer and soup.   For dessert I had 10751745 roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  10751745 shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of 10751745 meal. One thing I would have hoped for was for 10751745 dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  10751745 food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit 10751745 New York location. I never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props. This place is amazing. I make my way to Caesar's Palace to eat here every (and I mean every) time I'm in Las Vegas. 10751745 service is excellent, 10751745 decor is updated and modern, 10751745 food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back. I always order 10751745 Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits 10751745 spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are 10751745 Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and 10751745 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back. This restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you
