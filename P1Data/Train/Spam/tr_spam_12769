<font style='font-family:arial; font-size:12;'></pre>Dear Mrs Brown,<br>
<br>
We are very excited to let you know that a brand new property portal onthemarket.com is being launched on January 26th.  <br>
<br>
This is a property portal owned and run by a mutual consortium of estate agents across the UK and it has been created to provide a more controlled and relevant site for agents and their clients.<br>
<br>
We had to make a decision when agreeing to list with onthemarket.com to drop one of the two large portals and we chose Zoopla. We were contemplating doing so before onthemarket.com was created, as for some time we have been growing distinctly uneasy with the additional information Zoopla adds to the listings of our clients� properties, in particular the almost always inaccurate computer generated valuation figure.<br>
<br>
It is proving damaging to their saleability and the price buyers will pay. In addition we believe that many buyers fail to agree to pay the right
 price for properties because the Zoopla computer generated valuation is often a lot lower and so distorts the real picture for them.  <br>
<br>
Equally some properties are valued higher than the agents suggest by Zoopla�s computer generated valuation system, and so, wrong footing sellers who start off as a result, at inflated prices, and also buyers who do not see such properties in the right price category for them.<br>
<br>
Rightmove does not provide the same level of inaccurate data and so we chose to come away from Zoopla. In any case, Rightmove produce 4 times the number of enquiries for us over Zoopla. And our own website, www.curchods.com will show you everything we have for sale that is released for public viewing (we do also have many properties which we are selling for clients discreetly, so don�t forget to ask your local Curchods office for details of any they may have in your price range.<br>
<br>
We will be very proud for you to view onthemarket.com from the 26th
 January onwards.  We would of course welcome any feedback you may have on the new site when you have a look.<br>
<br>
As always, if you would like an update on the market, the value of your home now, or our advice on any property matter, feel free to contact me.<br>
<br>
Yours sincerely<br>
<br>
Becky Penfold<br>
Business Development Manager<br>
