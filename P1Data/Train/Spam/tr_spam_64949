The Porch could definitely be one of those options...I 11610053 caught a glimpse of that greatness today at lunch, but I wish I could have seen more. 

The restaurant itself is right next to Tei Tei Robata along the constantly busy street and sidewalk. It shares the big lot with Tei 11610053 Tei in the back that offers valet (I never understood the valet thing in a parking lot that's right next to the building). When we entered, the place was packed, so we grabbed a tall table with stools in the bar area so we didn't have to wait. We waited for a few moments, not too long, and a manager came by and asked if we had been helped yet. She quickly left and got someone and he came to take our order. We started off with the calamari and shrimp appetizer, and I ordered the crab cake salad for my main course.

The app came out real fast...almost suspiciously too fast. b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7 Immediately we both looked at each other while we chewed the rubber like substance that was our calamari. Way overcooked! The shrimp was decent, and the dipping sauce was ok. Just not very well executed. I've read in other reviews that this dish was enjoyable, so it probably was just a one time thing.

My salad really made things right though! 11610053 The crab cake was excellent! All of the flavors and textures in the salad were perfection. It was a well thought out and executed dish. The pile of mixed greens on one side of the plate was coated nicely with the dressing. The awesome crab cake, which wasn't loaded with breading and still had a fresh crab taste, was nestled on a pile of tomatoes, crunchy cucumber, and creamy avocado chunks. When all of these elements are eaten together...sooooo good!!!!

I didn't eat dessert, but the pics of that butter 11610053 cake made me wish that I had!

The Porch is a good option if you're in the area. The service was decent, most of the food was awesome, and you can't beat the location with the killer patio and the killer people watching vantage point. Swing by and give it a try, I'll definitely be back real soon!b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
