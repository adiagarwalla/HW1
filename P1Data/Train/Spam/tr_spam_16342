BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been 
on a quest to find his sibling.Gao's wife said from the United 
States she was still uneasy because of the lack of information."When I 
heard what they said, all I could think was 'Oh, it means 
he's still alive,"' Geng He said, crying, in a phone interview with 
The Associated Press.Charismatic and pugnacious, Gao was a galvanizing figure for the 
rights
ions on a yearlong package do not succeed.Boehner's office said even a 
two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">choose between two of the party's core constituencies: environmentalists who oppose Keystone 
and some unions who covet the jobs it would produce.But McConnell and 
other Republicans say the project would create thousands of jobs. The company's 
developer, TransCanada, says it could produce up to 20,000 jobs, while critics 
say the figure would be fewer than 3,500, including less than 1,000 
that would be permanent.After passing the catchall spending bill House leaders sent 
their members home until Monday or later, planning to return when the 
Senate produces a payroll tax cut measure for the House to vote 
on.The way was smoother for the compromise spending bill, which passed on 
a 296-121 vote. It would fund 10 Cabinet-level departments, such as the 
Pentagon and the Department of Education, and dozens of smaller agencies. It 
would finance everything from U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to veterans' 
services, and from airport security inspections to Congress' o
 X17Online.comJune 25: Britney Spears and boyfriend Jason Trawick head out for a 
romatic weekend in Palm Springs, CA. Jason Trawickmay have jumped the engagement 
gun becauseBritney Spearsjust posted a message hinting that he popped the question, 
and she said yes!Spears just went to herFacebookpage and wrote, "OMG. Last 
night Jason surprised me with the one gift I've been waiting for. 
Can't wait toshowyou! SO SO SO excited!!!! Xxo."TMZ broke the story that 
Trawick had planned to ask for Britney's hand in marriage during their 
trip to Vegas, and the smart money was that it was all 
supposed to go down tonight. But it seems that he just couldn't 
wait.Click here to follow FOX411 on Facebook and Twitter.Sources close to the 
couple tell us Trawick organized a massive celebratory dinner tonight at theChocolateLounge 
at the Sugar Factory in theParis Hotelbecause Spears loveschocolate.After dinner, the gang 
is set to go to Chateaunightcluband party the night away.TMZ is to
ey light their homes."Upton said he was not opposed to the more 
efficient -- and expensive-- curlicue fluorescents that have become increasingly familiar in 
recent years. But he said government should not penalize those who prefer 
traditional, incandescent bulbs."New lighting options are great news for the public, but 
the lesson is that markets and consumer demand are the best drivers 
of innovation and new choices," Upton said.Sen. Jeff Bingaman, chairman of the 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said the move would have little 
practical consequence, since it does not affect a 2007 law that requires 
manufacturers to produce or import more efficient bulbs. The five largest light 
bulb manufacturers have already switched to making and selling the more efficient 
bulbs, Bingaman said, so the enforcement delay only serves to confuse the 
public."Blocking funds to enforce minimum standards works against our nation getting the
