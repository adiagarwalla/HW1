Good Morning All

Thank you for your interest in our wildlife filmmaking workshops, I=E2=80=
=99m very much looking forward to meeting you all on Sunday.

The workshop starts at 10.30, and will be a mix of talks, presentations and=
 practical activities with a break for lunch at 12.00, with a view to learn=
ing more about filming wildlife on the Great Ouse Washes. If you haven=E2=
=80=99t already seen it, here is a video with more information about the pr=
oject and what we=E2=80=99re hoping to achieve:

I=E2=80=99m hoping we=E2=80=99ll all be able to get outside to do some film=
ing on the day, so if you have any video equipment or cameras with a video =
function, please do bring them along. Not to worry if you don=E2=80=99t, as=
 we have a couple of spare cameras for you to borrow.

I would also advise wearing wellies or walking boots as parts of the reserv=
e are quite muddy.

We=E2=80=99ll be meeting in the Pond Room which is through the tunnel on th=
e left as you walk into the centre, but if you=E2=80=99re having trouble fi=
nding it please feel free to ask a member of staff in the shop for directio=
ns.

If it=E2=80=99s your first time to the centre, here is a link with more det=
ailed information about how to find us:

http://www.wwt.org.uk/wetland-centres/welney/plan-your-visit/

I anticipate the workshops will finish approximately between 14:00 and 15:0=
0, which will give you the opportunity to spend some time on the reserve an=
d hopefully be able to put some new skills into practice if you would like =
to!

Once again, I look forward to meeting you and thank you kindly for your int=
erest in the project.

Any questions, please feel free to call me at any time on 07889 296632.

Kindest regards

Adam
