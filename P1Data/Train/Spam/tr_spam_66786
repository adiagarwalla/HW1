        Dear Reader,
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        Did you know that according to a study from an esteemed medical school, some types of milk are now connected to cancer&hellip; and could cause as much damage to your health as smoking four packs of cigarettes a day?
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        Think about that&hellip;
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        Smoking four packs a day is almost certain to lead to an early death&hellip;.but according to the latest research, a certain type of milk could be even worse.
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        Yet I&rsquo;d bet not one in 1,000 people knows what type of milk it is.
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        There&rsquo;s a good chance this milk may be in your fridge right now.
      </div>
      <div>
        &nbsp;
      </div>
      <div>
        It was in mine, too. Until I came across the research you&rsquo;re about to see.

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.0       It was not long before the girl's heart had been wholly won. Transported by her emotion, she met the caresses of her lover with those as unrestrained as his. Her very innocence deprived her of the protection which older women would have had. All was given freely, and even wildly, by Heloise; and all was taken by Abelard, who afterward himself declared:

"The pleasure of teaching her to love surpassed the delightful fragrance of all the perfumes in the world."

Yet these two could not always live in a paradise which was entirely their own. The world of Paris took notice of their close association. Some poems written to Heloise by Abelard, as if in letters of fire, were found and shown to Fulbert, who, until this time, had suspected nothing. Angrily he ordered Abelard to leave his house. He forbade his niece to see her lover any more.

But the two could not be separated; and, indeed, there was good reason why they should still cling together. Secretly Heloise left her uncle's house and fled through the narrow lanes of Paris to the dwelling of Abelard's sister, Denyse, where Abelard himself was living. There, presently, the young girl gave birth to a son, who was named Astrolabe, after an instrument used by astronomers, since both the father and the mother felt that the offspring of so great a love should have no ordinary name.

Fulbert was furious, and rightly so. His hospitality had been outraged and his niece dishonored. He insisted that the pair should at once be married. Here was revealed a certain weakness in the character of Abelard. He consented to the marriage, but insisted that it should be kept an utter secret.

Oddly enough, it was Heloise herself who objected to becoming the wife of the man she loved. Unselfishness could go no farther. She saw that, were he to marry her, his advancement in the Church would be almost impossible; for, while the very minor clergy sometimes married in spite of the papal bulls, matrimony was becoming a fatal bar to ecclesiastical promotion. And so Heloise pleaded pitifully, both with her uncle and with Abelard, that there should be no marriage. She would rather bear all manner of disgrace than stand in the way of Abelard's advancement.

He has himself given some of the words in which she pleaded with him:
