uate degrees; among Tea Party movement supporters and Tea Party opponents; among 
those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered

is open to settling the North Korean nuclear standoff through diplomacy, but 
only if Pyongyang improves ties with archrival South Korea.The comments by Assistant

worried allies in Seoul that diplomacy will progress only as long as

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency

 FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents 
further erode support for the in
sidered illegal.Peace talks with the Palestinians stalled more than three years ago, 
largely over continued Israeli settlement construction. With Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze, 
a recent round of meetings between Israeli and Palestinian envoys in Jordan 
has yielded no breakthroughs.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas is under intense international pressure 
to stay at the negotiating table. A final decision is expected after 
Abbas consults with Arab League officials over the weekend. The Palestine Liberation 
Organization discussed the issue on Monday but stopped short of urging Abbas 
to halt the contacts.Israel has said it wants to keep talking.Also Tuesday, 
Israeli authorities said they have received permission to force feed a Palestinian 
prisoner who has been on a hunger strike for more than six 
weeks.Prisons spokeswoman Sivan Weizman said 33-year-old Khader Adnan would not be force 
fed until "medical conditions" warranted it, but provided no further
