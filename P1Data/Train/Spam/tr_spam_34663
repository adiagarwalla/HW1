Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message 
with "advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word 
"advertisement" is in quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box 
cannot be called an advertisement. We assure you that we never sent 
these messages and have no relationship to this mailing. The fact is 
that at the end of August, we received a requirement from a 
distributor of harmful dietary supplements to remove an article about 
this harmful dietary supplements from our website Pohudeu.com. Because 
they have not provided any facts to refute our article, we have not 
agreed to remove it. Next they started this spam campaign to 
compromise our reputation, so that we would be closed for spamming. 
Our project Pohudeu.com is completely non commercial. We don't sell 
any kind of stuff, products or services, we don't earn on advertising. 
>From early September our website Pohudeu.com was under continual DDoS 
attacks. Nevertheless, we truly hope that spam-mailing and DDoS 
attacks will stop soon. We cannot tell when this campaign against our 
website Pohudeu.com will be end. We are sorry for this inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
