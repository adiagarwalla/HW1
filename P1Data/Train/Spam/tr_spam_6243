on went off, causing massive damage.Syrian TV showed shaken young girls in 
tears who said they were in the nearby Qazaz First Elementary School 
when the blast occurred. An hour after the blast, the school's gates 
were closed and no one was inside.The explosions left two craters at 
the gate of the military compound, one of them 3 meters (10 
feet) deep and 6 meters (20 feet) wide. Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad 
Makdissi posted a message on his Facebook page urging people to go 
to hospitals to donate blood."The house shook like it was an earthquake," 
housewife Maha Hijazi said as she stood outside her house across the 
street from the targeted compound, which is headquarters for a military intelligence 
department known as the Palestine Branch.The latest major explosion in the capital 
occurred on April 27 when a suicide bomber detonated an explosives belt 
near members of the security forces, killing at least nine people and 
wounding 26.The previous deadliest att
ack in Damascus occurred on Dec. 23, when two car bombers blew 
themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops 
shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the 
cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N. 
military observers now in Syria should grow to m
May 9, 2012: Russian President Vladimir Putin, left, and Defense Minister Anatoly 
Serdyukov, second left, speaks with officers and WWII veterans on the Red 
Square, after the Victory Day Parade, which commemorates the 1945 defeat of 
Nazi Germany in Moscow, Russia.APWASHINGTON  Just days after reclaiming the Russian 
presidency, Vladimir Putin has canceled his planned visit to the United States, 
where he'd been scled to attend a major economic summit and meet 
with President Obama.The White House confirmed in a statement late Wednesday that 
Putin told Obama on a phone call he'd be sending Prime Minister 
Dmitry Medvedev in his place. Putin claimed he was too busy finalizing 
cabinet appointments to make the May 18-19 G-8 Summit at Camp David. 
Yet the Obama administration had moved the gathering to the Camp David 
presidential retreat in Maryland from the planned venue in Chicago partly to 
accommodate Putin.Whether or not the scle change marked an intentional s

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem 
 t the TSC does not dispute. An official told Fox News that 
telling people theyre on the list would compromise security.If terrorists knew they 
were on the list, they would change their identity or turn to 
an operative who may not be on the list to conduct an 
attack, the TSC official said.Jamal Tarhuni is one of the Americans on 
the no-fly list, and he says the feds got it wrong. The 
Oregon businessman only learned he was on the list when he tried 
to fly home to Portland from Tunisia. He had just completed a 
humanitarian visit to his native Libya with the Christian group Medical Teams 
International. They delivered water and medical supplies to victims of the countrys 
civil war.Tarhuni says he was eventually interviewed for several hours by FBI 
agents and kept in Tunis for a month before being allowed to 
fly home. He remains on the no-fly list and still doesnt know 
why. He was recently forced to take a 36-hour train ride to 
give a speech in Minneapolis. Then 
ct here at the first Spacecraft Technology Expo, where thousands of government 
and industry officials have gathered to discuss innovative new technologies and the 
future of human spaceflight.ATK had already been working on a new private 
rocket, called Liberty, which it submitted as a contender in the second 
round of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program last year. Ultimately, the Liberty 
rocket was not selected to receive funding, but ATK continued development of 
the booster under an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA. As part 
of this arrangement, NASA shares its expertise in designing and testing the 
rocket but does not provide money for the project.Now, ATK has unveiled 
plans for a complete launch system centered around the Liberty rocket. The 
design includes a space capsule to carry passengers to destinations in low-Earth 
orbit, such as the International Space Station, said Kent Rominger, vice president 
and program manager for Liberty."The goal is t
