Oh man, this place is awesome 8583562 and cheap!! First advice, call in advance to make a reservation! Since, we were coming from the US, I tried to message the restaurant to see if I could make a reservation and they replied immediately telling me that I needed to call them. So, I called them using Skype and got a reservation without any issue. I'm glad that I called though cause the restaurant itself is small and does get pretty crowded. We were seated right away when we arrived. We ordered the following items:

Salmon Carpaccio: best dish that we had there
Hotate Butter Scallop: 8583562 buttery but good
Beef Tongue: good but not the best
Yaki Udon: good as a filler if you're drinking
Calamari- not the best 
Takoyaki (deep fried octopus balls): good but not my cup of tea
Duck Salad: yumz

They have multiple locations of Guu's. Wish I could've try some of the other Guu's. Maybe next time, Canada. :)53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea
