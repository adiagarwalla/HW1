 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece were, by wetting themselves from head to foot=
; besides which, itfrequently caused them to take cold, of which the parent=
s complained.Some took their children away without notice; others came and =
gavethe master what they called "_a good set down_." It was, therefore,thou=
ght necessary to forbid the children washing themselves, andto wash all tha=
t came dirty. But it was soon found that the dirtychildren increased so fas=
t, that it required one person's timeto attend to them; besides which, it h=
ad another bad effect, itencouraged the parents in laziness; and they told =
me, when Icomplained of their sending the children to school dirty, "That i=
ndeedthey had no time to wash their children; there was a trough in thescho=
ol for that purpose, and the persons who had charge of the schoolwere paid =
for it, and ought to do it." In consequence of this, thetrough was taken aw=
ay, and it was represented to the parents, that itwas their duty to keep th=
eir children clean; that unless they did so,they would be sent home to be w=
ashed; and if they persisted in sendingthem without being washed, there wou=
ld be no alternative left but todismiss them from the school altogether. Th=
is offended some of theparents, and they took their children out of the sch=
ool, but manyafterwards petitioned to have them readmitted. I mention this =
merelyto prevent others, who may be concerned in the establishment of infan=
tschools, from incurring an unnecessary expense, and to shew that theparent=
s will value the school equally as well if you make them washtheir children=
, as if you did it for them.The plan that we have acted upon to enforce cle=
anliness, is asfollows: As soon as the children are assembled in the school=
, themonitors cause them to hold out their hands, with their heads up; they=
then inspect their hands and their faces, and all those who are dirtyare de=
sired to stand out, to be examined by the master, who willeasily perceive w=
hether they have been washed that morning; if not,they are sent home to be =
washed, and if the mother has any sense ofpropriety, she will take care tha=
t it shall not often occur. But itmay be found, that some have been washed,=
 and been playing with thedirt, when coming to school, which some children =
are very apt to do;in this case they have a pat on the hand, which generall=
y cures them.There is much trouble at first, to keep the children quite cle=
an; someof their parents are habitually dirty, and in such cases the childr=
enwill be like them; these will, therefore, require more trouble thanothers=
, but they will soon acquire cleanly habits, and, with proper

were, by wetting themselves from head to foot; besides which, itfrequently =
caused them to take cold, of which the parents complained.Some took their c=
hildren away without notice; others came and gavethe master what they calle=
d "_a good set down_." It was, therefore,thought necessary to forbid the ch=
ildren washing themselves, andto wash all that came dirty. But it was soon =
found that the dirtychildren increased so fast, that it required one person=
's timeto attend to them; besides which, it had another bad effect, itencou=
raged the parents in laziness; and they told me, when Icomplained of their =
sending the children to school dirty, "That indeedthey had no time to wash =
their children; there was a trough in theschool for that purpose, and the p=
ersons who had charge of the schoolwere paid for it, and ought to do it." I=
n consequence of this, thetrough was taken away, and it was represented to =
the parents, that itwas their duty to keep their children clean; that unles=
s they did so,they would be sent home to be washed; and if they persisted i=
n sendingthem without being washed, there would be no alternative left but =
todismiss them from the school altogether. This offended some of theparents=
, and they took their children out of the school, but manyafterwards petiti=
oned to have them readmitted. I mention this merelyto prevent others, who m=
ay be concerned in the establishment of infantschools, from incurring an un=
necessary expense, and to shew that theparents will value the school equall=
y as well if you make them washtheir children, as if you did it for them.Th=
e plan that we have acted upon to enforce cleanliness, is asfollows: As soo=
n as the children are assembled in the school, themonitors cause them to ho=
ld out their hands, with their heads up; theythen inspect their hands and t=
heir faces, and all those who are dirtyare desired to stand out, to be exam=
ined by the master, who willeasily perceive whether they have been washed t=
hat morning; if not,they are sent home to be washed, and if the mother has =
any sense ofpropriety, she will take care that it shall not often occur. Bu=
t itmay be found, that some have been washed, and been playing with thedirt=
, when coming to school, which some children are very apt to do;in this cas=
e they have a pat on the hand, which generally cures them.There is much tro=
uble at first, to keep the children quite clean; someof their parents are h=
abitually dirty, and in such cases the childrenwill be like them; these wil=
l, therefore, require more trouble thanothers, but they will soon acquire c=
