Alcohol has long been used as a soporific, but in reality, it�s not very good for sleeping through the night. While it may help you fall asleep faster, a new study finds, it�s likely to lead to the disruption of restorative sleep during the night, as evidenced by changes in brain waves. �The take-home message here is that alcohol is not actually a particularly good sleep aid even though it may seem like it helps you get to sleep quicker,� said Christian L. Nichols, in a news release. �In fact, the quality of the sleep you get is significantly altered and disrupted,� which can lead to significant problems with cognition during waking hours. Another new study found that poor sleep in teens can be a precursor of problematic alcohol use (and other risky behaviors) years down the road, in a kind of vicious cycle.
