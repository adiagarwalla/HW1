was true or suspected it was false, Lunsford said."We still need to 
know. That's our job," he added. "By not telling us, it essentially 
rendered us ineffective and we had no chance to help those children."Informed 
of Lunsford's comments, Raykovitz said, "He can feel anything he wants to 
feel."Charles Markham, retired president of Uni-Marts Inc. and a Second Mile board 
member from the late 1990s until about 2004, said that Raykovitz never 
discussed the 2002 case with him personally or at board meetings. "If 
I'd known anything in 2002, I would have had a hard time 
keeping it under my hat," Markham said.Two other former board members -- 
Larry Snavely, who runs a State College-based highercation marketing firm, and 
Donald Cross, a retired Centre County school employee -- said Raykovitz never 
mentioned the 2002 allegation. Another former member said he was not told, 
but asked that he not be publicly identified.David Woodle, acting CEO, refused 
to address concer
town about 60 miles south of Tripoli. "Right now, they get freedom. 
What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With 
a huge rebuilding process ahead, she said, she hopes her nation will 
accept her help.When he returns after his diplomatic training, El-Najah said he 
will carry a simple message."We have to f
king the can down the road.""The American people are tired of that. 
I think, frankly, I'm tired of it. On the House side, we've 
seen this kind of action before coming out of the Senate. It's 
time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend 
this for one year," Boehner said.But Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Boehner 
has no room to complain after agreeing last week to abide by 
a deal worked out between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell. House Republicans have said they played no role in 
last week's talks between the two Senate leaders"Last week, Speaker Boehner sat 
in a meeting with Leader Reid and Leader McConnell and he gave 
Leader McConnell his proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. ... The Senate 
came to a deal, and now Speaker Boehner must keep his word," 
Schumer said in a statement release Sunday.Schumer said failure to pass the 
legislation could cost Republicans their majority in the House, "and

after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked 
alive from the icy water immediately after the accident and taken to 
a hospital. Workers have since pulled out 10 bodies from the Sea

to port in a fierce storm when a strong wave broke some
