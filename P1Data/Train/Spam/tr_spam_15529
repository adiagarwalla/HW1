<p style="font-size:xx-small;">eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that
 WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state 
backed him in 2008 but voted solidly Tuesday to ban gay marriag
