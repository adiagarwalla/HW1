<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."
  summer of 2007, police say. Justin-Jinich was working at The Red 
and Black Cafe inside Broad Street Books on May 6, 2009, when 
Morgan walked in disguised in a wig and glasses and shot her 
seven times with a handgun before fleeing.Prosecutor Timothy Liston argued in closing 
Friday that Morgan was motivated by "old-fashioned hate.""And she's everything that he 
hates," Liston said. "She's successful, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's Jewish, she 
goes to Wesleyan ... he cyberstalks her, he physically stalks her while 
in disguise ..."Justin-Jinich would have graduated from Wesleyan last year. She was 
a 2006 graduate of the Westtown School, a Quaker boarding school outside 
Philadelphia.Wesleyan spokesman David Pesci said in an email statement Friday that while 
the court's ruling "brings to a close a chapter in this awful 
story, the memory of Johanna, who brought such joy to so many, 
lives on here at Wesleyan."While attending Wesleyan, Justin-Jinich filed a ha
 illing and injuring American soldiers in Iraq, and he admitted that he 
tried to send numerous weapons from Kentucky to Iraq to be used 
against American soldiers."Hale said the joint efforts of federal and local law 
enforcement had thwarted "the ongoing intentions of an experienced terrorist.""The guilty plea 
today sends a strong message to anyone who would attempt similar crimes 
that they will face the same determined law enforcement and prosecution efforts," 
he said.
