Black Hoof has been tagged in my bookmarks 16463665 list for about a year. I'm normally very "go and get it", but for this particular experience I wanted to be there with someone who'd love it as much as I do. And that means going with someone fearless and fun. Enter the bf.

We went on a Saturday night, around 7pm. 16463665 Fully expected the place to be completely rammed, with barely any elbow space and a very long wait. Not at all!!! We got a parking spot on the street RIGHT in the front of the restaurant...so practically valet! The server guessed it was due to all the Christmas parties going on that weekend, which made sense. 

We ordered the horse tartare, 54727569148019602344fbf133afa7b4 which was gamey and delicate tasting. The pig's blood pappardelle was our favourite!!! The blood taste was just enough so you knew what you were eating, but the texture was just a bit springy and we gobbled that right up. The bone marrow was ok - I mean, I always feel I SHOULD order bone marrow from the menu when it's there, but I'm never wowwed by it.  

Also ordered the fried sweetbreads. 16463665 Very aromatic, but fried is fried is fried. Fried stuff always tastes the same. Last thing to come was the pork jowl, which was all fatty goodness. Actually the pork jowl would have been a better dish to have near the beginning, since it was so heavy!
