Hola (and other generic introduction message titles)
Hi,

I am Owain, i am have been attempting to teach myself Spanish on and off for=
 three months now and seem to keep hitting a dead end.

I am a student and cannot really afford lessons, so I am restricted to infor=
mation available on the internet - however once I believe I have a basic kno=
wledge of the language=20
I am going to invest in a few lessons in order to improve my speaking and l
istening.


My story so far has gone: 1. Understand spanish pronunciation, so that in ba=
sic terms i can read something and pronounce it like it should sound in Span=
ish (check). 2. Learn s
ome Spanish words using a flash card software program (check) 3. Start stri
nging words together so i can start speaking spanish (failing) - basically I=
 am stuck on where I need to start, what words do i need to learn in order t=
o make sentences (I, I=20
am, I have, We have, I like etc), as well as which rules I need to learn to
 make sure what I am saying makes sense - there seems to be lots of sources =
telling me different things (I spent a long time learning rules which i then=
 found out are no longe
r widely used ) . I am all together very confused (yet no less determined),
 so I am here initially to seek guidance on where i should go next.

Any help would be much appreciated .

Thanks,

Owain

Welcome to the forums, Owain.

It sounds a little bit like you're trying to build a house by putting on all=
 the shingles before you've started pouring the foundation. Learning Spanish=
 will go better for you
 if you start with an extremely basic set of rules and a very small set of=20=

words and practice them enough to give you a scaffold onto which you can inc=
orporate new rules one or two at a time and new words a few at a time.

The most basic conversations that you can have with other people are greetin=
gs, introductions and getting to know one another, and many language texts s=
tart with these types o
f conversations: asking and answering questions such as how are you, what's
 your name, who is that, where are you from, what do you do, what do you lik=
e, and so on.

Thanks both,

WRHOLT, thanks for the advice - i already have some understanding of the bas=
ics - how are you? how old are you? etc. Maybe i have gotten far to ahead of=
 my station, and i need
 to drop back to the basics. I think I had a differnt approach as i feel if
 i understand the meanings and rules of a language then it should all fall i=
nto place. My problem is, for example, i know 'que tal?' means 'how are you'=
, but i actually have n
o idea what 'que' or 'tel' means or why that when put together they make th
e equivalent of 'how are you?', so i feel it doesnt actually help me in the =
long run - im not sure if my logic makes any sense, but its something i am b=
attling with at the mom
ent.


Thanks again for taking the time to reply.

Kind regards,

Owain

My advice is don't try to translate or understand word for word. Learn the m=
eanings and little by little you will get to know how the individual parts o=
f phrases and sentences
 work by themselves. Otherwise, you'll get stuck in the dictionaries and th
at won't help you acquire any fluency.

Good understanding of your native-language's grammar is helpful. For instanc=
e, it may help to know what an indirect object is. Basic functions of langua=
ge a very much the same
. Knowing them will help you learn any language.

It's good to know it, because it will help you understand the lo los les las=
