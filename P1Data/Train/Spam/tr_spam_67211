as Francos typically translate into big bucks for universities.After his student gig, 
Franco, 33, wound up teaching an NYU course this past fall on

resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Amidst the holiday melee, shoppers arent rushing to pick up their copy 
of the much-talked about Lindsay Lohan issue of Playboy this week.It was 
one thing to see Lohans nude Playboy spread when it was leaked 
on the Internet last week. Its another experience entirely to see the 
10 pages of photos in person in the magazine, which hit newsstands 
Friday.But not many consumers are paying for that experience. In fact, interest 
seems low in seeing Lohans intensely air-brushed impersonation of Marilyn Monroe in 
glossy print. Fox411 spent Friday morning trolling the shelves of newsstands and 
gas stations from New York to Philadelphia only to be confronted with 
the same reality at each: Lohans glassy-eyed stare peaking above the backs 
of more family friendly fare, with no one staring back or making 
a purchase.No one has bought it, was the resounding answer to our 
query at each stop.Click here to follow FOX411 on Twitter.It shouldnt come 
as a surprise. Once the photos wer
 , Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.
providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears. 
Youll truly feel like youre on top of the Buri Khalifa with 
Cruise.Hope youre not afraid of
