		  running late. He pointed out to me where 16645008 restaurant is located (it was my first time) and told me that he would call 16645008 restaurant to let them know that I was coming. Much appreciated! It was an early dinner reservation, even though I was late, and 16645008 restaurant was about half full when we arrived. By 16645008 time dinner ended, however, it seemed like 16645008 whole restaurant was full. We had lamb porterhouse chops served with two sauces (preserved serrano sauce and mint chimichurri) and a blue corn tamale, coffee rubbed filet mignon with roasted corn, black angus new york steak strip with mashed potatoes, and baby romaine salad with roasted garlic dressing and hominy croutons (how unique). Every single entree was cooked perfectly, and each bite was delicious from beginning to end. 16645008 service at 16645008 restaurant was top-notch. We were promptly seated when we arrived (we had reservations), our orders were taken quickly, and our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. Our waitress Brenda was wonderful, and all of our servers were very attentive. As we left 16645008 restaurant, we were greeted by at least half a dozen staff members. 16645008 food was bit pricey, but well worth 16645008 culinary experience. My family and I don't come to Vegas often, but I felt that since we were here, we might as well indulge a bit and enjoy ourselves--we certainly did that at Mesa Grill. My experience started out really nice. 16645008 restaurant is beautiful and has a great feel to it. Great service at first, tortilla soup was delicious. As 16645008 night went on it felt like our waiter was forgetting about us. 16645008 service got really slow and we waited nearly an hour for our entrees. I had 16645008 lobster tacos and they were delicious. I tasted 16645008 grilled chicken and it was not good at all. For dessert we had 16645008 blueberry cobbler with ice cream. 16645008 ice cream was melted and it just all around wasn't very good. We were there for over 2 hours not by our own choice. Some food was great some was not so good but ultimately 16645008 service is what ruined it for me, especially since it started off strong. I probably wouldn't come back. "Not Mexican and not Chinese." Those were 16645008 parameters set by Beau S. when he asked me to pick a restaurant for a "late lunch/early dinner" yesterday  (4/13/11) before I had to head to work.  Somehow, we ended up at Mesa, which, according to Beau, isn't Mexican, it's Tex-Mex, which is just "spicy American food." Upon walking in, it sorta looks like Guy Fieri had free reign to liberally apply as many "flame" touches as possible - from 16645008 sconces to 16645008 ceiling, there were flames...and cowhide backed chairs, and toile backed chairs, and
