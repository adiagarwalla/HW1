urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv
 heights.
APJune 3: Workers try to install a pressure indicator inside the Unit 
1 reactor at Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Fukushima Prefecture, 
northern Japan.TOKYO-- Japan's prime minister announced Friday that the country's tsunami-damaged nuclear 
plant has achieved a stable state of "cold shutdown," a crucial step 
toward the eventual lifting of evacuation orders and closing of the plant.Prime 
Minister Yoshihiko Noda's announcement was intended to reassure the nation that significant 
progress has been made in the nine months since the March 11 
tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdowns in 
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.But experts say the plant 
140 miles northeast of Tokyo remains vulnerable to problems and its surroundings 
are contaminated by radiation and closing the plant safely will take 30 
or more years."The reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have 
reached a state of cold shutd

there are going to be those opposed to the burning of fossil 
fuels who will continue to oppose the project on that basis. I 
would hope that opposition would dissipate as well, but I'm not hopeful."Nebraska 
lawmakers convened for a special session that Republican Gov. Dave Heineman called 
last month to address pipeline issues. Two laws were approved to provide 
greater state oversight of major oil pipelines, including the Keystone XL. TransCanada 
agreed to move the route away from theSandhills and submit to a 
state environmental review.Some environmental advocates remain skeptical.Jane Kleeb, director of the anti-pipeline 
group Bold Nebraska, said research hasn't shown the effects of the tar 
sands oil on land, water or human health if a pipeline were 
to leak. Kleeb noted that the state hasn't enacted laws to shield 
landowners from oil-spill liability or dealt with the prospect of eminent 
 ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
inly hope that's right because if the Russians have provided Iran with 
sophisticated jamming equipment it means a lot else is at risk too."Of 
course, given the secretive nature of the mission and the RQ-170 drone 
itself, the truth may never emerge -- and may even be something 
purely mundane."It's entirely possible the aircraft ran out of gas and malfunctioned 
independent of any Iranian electronic interference," Trimble told FoxNews.com.Predators, Demons and More: 
The Wide World of DronesUnmanned drones get more sophisticated with each generation 
-- faster, stronger, smarter. Here's the current crew of killer and recon 
drones, and a few from the future.
