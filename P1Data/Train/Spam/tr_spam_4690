 transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges

of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's

approved the spending bill by midnight Friday, the Obama administration agreed there 
would be no federal shutdown. For extra measure, the House also passed 
two stopgap spending bills, one to fund the government for a single 
day and the other for a week.Agreement on the spending legislation was 
reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked Obama 
from easing rules on people who visit and send money to relatives 
in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting 
a 2007 law, passed during President George W. Bush's administration, on energy 
efficiency standards that critics argued would make it hard for people to 
purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.This year's 4.2 percent payroll tax rate will 
jump back to its normal 6.2 percent on Jan. 1 unless action 
is taken by Congress. Few lawmakers want to be blamed for a 
tax increase that would affect 160 mi
 cuts and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.Negotiators on the payroll tax 
measure worked behind closed doors Friday in hopes of sealing agreement on 
how to pay for the measure. Simply extending the current 2 percentage 
point payroll tax cut would cost $120 billion, while extending unemployment benefits 
for the long-term jobless and preventing a cut in Medicare payment to 
physicians would add tens of billions of dollars more.A House-passed version of 
the payroll tax bill would give President Barack Obama 60 days to 
decide whether to build the proposed, 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline.Obama, with the 
support of congressional Democrats, has announced he will delay that decision until 
after next year's elections, citing a need to study the impact the 
pipeline would have on sensitive lands in Nebraska. Obama has threatened to 
reject a payroll tax bill if it includes language easing work on 
the pipeline.The postponement would let Democrats avoid having to

and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w
