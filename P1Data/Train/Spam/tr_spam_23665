WASHINGTON  Michelle Obama is urging people to give to charities for 
the holiday season as she brought more than 800 gifts Friday from 
White House staff to donate to the U.S. Marine Corps Toys for 
Tots campaign.The first lady also got a surprise invitation from a soldier 
to be his date at next year's Marine Corps Ball.Lance Cpl. Aaron 
Leeks, 20, of Frederick, Md., said he asked Obama to accompany him 
because he's a fan and admires her work to support the military.When 
Obama was sorting toys at the charity event and came close to 
Leeks, he leaned over a toy bin and got her attention to 
pop the question. The first lady smiled and called over a staff 
member as she chatted with Leeks."She said she'd love to go," Leeks 
said. "Actually, she said I'd need to speak to her husband, too, 
but she said she'd love to."Leeks said he plans to follow up 
on his invitation. In January, he will be deployed for the first 
time to Afghanistan but plans to attend the ball when he'
 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
OWN/Jenny Craig/YoutubeMariah Carey went on Rosie O'Donnell's show to talk about her 
weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains 
Richard Zeeb, the former Chief Marketing Officer for the diet company Medifast, 
currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers 
and nutrion

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Dec. 15, 2011: Villagers hold placards chanting slogans as they march around 
their village during a protest in Wukan village, in China's Guangdong province. 
A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death in police 
custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's farewell Friday 
as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his sacrifice for 
them.BEIJING -- A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death 
in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
 own," Noda said. "Now that we have achieved stability in the reactors, 
a major concern for the nation has been resolved."Radiation released from the 
plant has been significantly ced, and additional safety measures installed at the 
plant ensure stability even in the event of another major disaster, he 
said.Noda said he hopes conditions will improve quickly so that the people 
who have been displaced by the crisis can return home "even a 
day sooner.""There are many issues that remain," Noda said. "Our battle is 
not over."The government's official endorsement of the claim by Tokyo Electric Power 
Co. that the reactors have reached cold shutdown status is a necessary 
step toward revising evacuation zones around the plant and shifting the focus 
from simply stabilizing the facility to actually starting the arduous process of 
shutting it down.But Noda acknowledged the assessment has some important caveats.The government 
said Fukushima Dai-ichi has reached cold shutdo
the report investigating allegations of abuse dating back to 1945.The commission received 
some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a 
risk ... is untenable," he s
