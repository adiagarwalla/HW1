President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w
MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on 
 identify potential Mitt Romney voters in the state, which has non-partisan 
voter registration.And Now, A Word From CharlesIt must say now this is 
another unique example of evolution in which a species evolves one way 
and turns around and goes back.That also hasn't been seen, at least 
recently, meaning the last million years or so.-- Charles Krauthammer on Special 
Report with Bret Baier.Chris Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">DUBLIN  Police in Northern Ireland say they have ended an overnight 
search of Belfast Lough after a woman's claim that her baby fell 
from a ferry into the water proved to be false.The story that 
a 37-year-old woman and her infant plunged together into the harbor  
 but only the mother was rescued    made headlines 
Thursday across Britain and Ireland.But police said officers have concluded the woman 
fell alone. She spent 15 minutes in the water and was treated 
for hypothermia in a Belfast hospital.Police say other passengers on the ferry 
from Scotland reported seeing a baby with the woman, but after interviewing 
her family, they now believe she had no child with her.The search 
lasted 18 hours and involved a police helicopter and several vessels.Sign up

 AMMAN, Jordan  A U.S. State Department official responsible for refugees says 
Washington has allocated $40 million to assist relief organizations aiding victims of 
the Syrian crisis.Anne Richard, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and 
Migration, says the money will be funneled through international and local agencies 
inside Syria and in surrounding countries, including Jordan.She says Palestinians and Iraqis 
in Syria will also benefit.Richard told reporters on Thursday in Amman that

past five years.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and

ill could not reach a compromise.On the heels of that negotiation collapse, 
House Republicans began to debate a proposal Thursday to shift around a 
portion of those planned cuts -- largely sparing the military from the 
full brunt of the impact.The GOP proposal is estimated to be worth 
about $242 billion in savings over 10 years -- to do that, 
it cuts into entitlements spending as well as other areas, something Democrats 
oppose. The Pentagon would not be entirely spared from cuts, but the 
GOP plan effectively takes the budget ax off cruise control and puts 
somebody in the driver's seat."It would decimate our military at the very 
moment when our men and women are over fighting in Afghanistan," Rep. 
Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee, said of the 
original plan. "So what we're saying is we don't want to lose
