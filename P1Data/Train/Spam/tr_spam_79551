 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv
t to the U.S. Senate in 2012. But Democratic leaders had hoped 
to run at least a mildly competitive candidate to force Republicans to 
spend money on the Senate race.The Texas Democratic Party had no immediate 
comment Friday evening.

assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 s home next year.Later at the White House, Press Secretary Jay Carney 
was asked whether the president would consider such an offer. Carney said 
that may be the first the president was hearing about this."The first 
lady's commitment to military families is very strong, indeed," he said. "So 
I'm sure she was flattered by the invitation."Obama has supported the Toys 
for Tots campaign for each of the last three years and urges 
White House staff to buy gifts to donate. She said they had 
a 27 percent increase in donations this year."It's not too late to 
donate," she said. "It's still important to nudge our neighbors to give, 
give, give. We need people to bring in toys like never before."Millions 
of families rely on such gifts to make the holidays special for 
their children, she said.She hauled in a big red bag of toys, 
slung over her shoulder to the Washington military base Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling. 
She wished volunteers a "Merry Christmas" and helped sort toys 
trator at the site, said. Still, everyone has to be prepared for 
the worst. Were on the pointed end of the stick. ... We 
come to work with that on our mind.
