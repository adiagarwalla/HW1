nd relief operations, attributed the high casualties "partly to the complacency of 
people because they are not in the usual path of storms" despite 
warnings by officials that one was approaching."We've had flooding before but nothing 
like this," Cruz, the Iligan mayor said, recalling floods in the early 
1950s. "We have a good drainage system but it as simply overwhelmed. 
The rainfall fell heavily on the mountains and this flowed down to 
two of our river systems and they overflowed and swept away houses 
and covered the highway and residential areas."About 143,000 people were affected in 
13 southern and central provinces, including 45,000 who fled to evacuation centers. 
About 7,000 houses were swept away, destroyed or damaged, the Office of 
Civil Defense said.An estimated 35 percent of evacuees are children, said Trevor 
Clark, head of UNICEF in the southern Mindanao region. Running water and 
hygiene were major concerns, followed by a lack of clothing, blankets and
APDecember 18, 2011: Remains of destroyed houses, toppled trucks and uprooted trees 
lie along a flood-hit area in Cagayan de Oro city, southern Philippines.ILIGAN, 
Philippines  With funeral parlors overwhelmed, authorities in a flood-stricken southern Philippine 
city on Monday organized the first mass burial of some of nearly 
700 people who were swept to their deaths in one of worst 
calamities to strike the region in decades.For the first time in a 
day, the staggering death toll from Friday night's disaster, spawned by a 
tropical storm, remained little changed but the number of missing varied widely. 
Official figures put the missing at 82, while the Philippine Red Cross 
estimated 800.The disparity underscores the difficulty in accounting for people who could 
be buried in the mud and debris littering much of the area 
or could be alive but lost in crowded evacuation centers or elsewhere."We 
lost count of how many are missing," said Benito Ramos, head of 
the gove
92. It soon became a household name in Sweden and in the 
1970's it released its first turbocharged model -- the landmark Saab 99.To 
auto enthusiasts, Saab was known for its quirks such as placing the 
ignition lock between the front seats and becoming the first car to 
have heated seating in 1971.GM bought a 50 percent stake and management 
control of Saab in 1989, and gained full ownership in 2000. The 
aircraft and defense company with the same name remained an independent entity, 
building fighter jets and weapons systems.Saab Automobile's sales peaked at 133,000 cars 
in 2006. After that, sales dwindled to 93,000 cars in 2008 and 
just 27,000 in 2009, as GM -- itself in bankruptcy protection following 
the financial crisis -- prepared to wind down the Swedish brand.Muller stepped 
in after a takeover attempt by a consortium led by Swedish sports 
car maker Koenigsegg failed. Analysts expressed doubt over Saab's chances of survival 
under Spyker, which later changed i

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Kim's passing but decisions will almost certainly be delayed as it 
is not clear if North Korean officials will be in position to 
handle any engagement with the outside, the U.S. officials said.   
            
            
     Kim Jong Il, 1941-2011North Korea's longtime leader 
ruled with an iron grip
 air of rainbows and a brilliant new star. Soviet records, however, indicate 
he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115

air or in the ground, and that some people may have been 
fatally struck by ricocheting bullets. Kasymov conceded, however, that the police force 
would have to put in place better contingency planning for the deployment 
of nonlethal crowd control techniques.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
chairperson-in-office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, expressed his concern in a statement 
at the measures adopted in suppressing the disorder."Any action to control crowds 
by law enforcement should be proportionate and in line with international human 
rights standards," he said.Rights activists will likely also be concerned by what 
appeared to heavy-handed treatment of detainees at Zhanaozen's main police station Sunday 
evening. Journalists at the station reported hearing screams coming from what appeared 
to be interrogation rooms, while a number of men with bloodied faces
