MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are 
seen on 
President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w
bvioulsy this position may put us at odds with others, but when 
we think about our faith, the thing at root (is) not just 
Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, but the golden rule, treat others the 
way you want to be treated."Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this 
report.

and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to 
the days when a handful of special interests controlled our state and 
local governments? No, instead we put reforms in place that rightfully put 
the hardworking taxpayers of W
 on previous test work and investment in a very lean, commercial way."Lockheed 
Martin will also provide support as a major subcontractor for the Liberty 
System, ATK officials announced today. This work includes designing various components for 
the spacecraft, such as avionics, propulsion systems, navigation and control, and the 
vehicle's docking system.The infrastructure we put in place that's already there to 
support testing and production is going to shorten the timeline," said Scott 
Norris, leader of the Liberty program at Lockheed Martin. "All three of 
our companies have worked together in the past, integrating things and working 
together. I think we're well poised to meet our scle, as aggressive 
as it is, with things we've already paid for in the past."The 
Liberty rocket and spacecraft have been submitted for consideration for the third 
and final round of funding under NASA's commercial crew program, Rominger said.
