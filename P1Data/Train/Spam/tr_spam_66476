I can't get enough of the Green Eggs here. 4720333 Each time I come, I know I should probably try something different, and yet, I still order the Green Eggs every time. What can I do though? Eggs scrambled with cheese, spinach, and artichoke. So creamy and good. And then toast, potatoes, and chicken apple sausage on the side? No way am I ordering anything else. Best part is that the portions are so big that I usually have leftovers. So I get to have more of that deliciousness later too. Yum.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Loving the food, not so much the service. I came here for a Saturday morning brunch. When you walk in, you have to sign your name on a pad of paper stuck to the wooden pole on the porch. 4720333 About 12 groups were in front of us, and we were told that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Instead, we only had to wait about 5 minutes (YES!) because the people in front of us had all left. We ended up sitting outside on their porch, which was pretty lovely (besides the Mosquitos). 

I ordered the green eggs and a glass of their fresh 4720333 squeezed orange juice. The juice was delicious, but I wouldn't recommend ordering it (see below). The eggs were also great; a little bit soggier than I expected, but I think it was better that way because of the feta and veggies mixed in. The order comes in a huge plate with a lot of potato hash, too much to finish. You could probably split this dish with another person if you are not feeling hungry.

Food aside, the service was pretty meh. 4720333 I expected a lot more from all the raving and hype around this establishment. After skipping the long wait, we had to flag down a waitress to order our food (after 15-20 minutes of sitting around). And then, my orange juice literally took 50 minutes to come out. EVEN THOUGH the couple who arrived 45 minutes after us got their drinks first. It was pretty busy, and they only had one waitress to cover the entire outdoor seating. I understand the struggle, but still, 50 minutes for a drink is ridiculous; I was finished with my meal by the time it came out, and I had asked to cancel it, but she misheard and brought it out anyways. 

Also, the returned check came back with a wrong receipt. By this point, we were pretty frustrated with the service, so we paid and left ASAP, only realizing afterwards that they had never given us back our credit cards. Overall, nice place and food. But they definitely need to step up their service.51d02b4edbc4a1ba62d624558eb37c5b
