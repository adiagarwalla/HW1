<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
 asty into a third generation.North Korea proudly trumpets its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and has a history of aggression against its southern neighbor, 
and there has been uncertainty about whether Pyongyang will now lean toward 
provocation or reconciliation -- and how tightly Pyongyang will cling to its 
nuclear program.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and has developed 
missiles with the potential to attack its neighbors and possibly reach the 
United States.South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said Tuesday that Seoul is 
ready for cooperation "if North Korea shows sincerity."Shortly before Kim Jong Il's 
death, Washington and Pyongyang appeared close to a deal on food aid. 
The North, in turn, was expected to suspend uranium enrichment, which could 
give Pyongyang another possible route to making nuclear bombs and is a 
crucial hurdle to restarting six-nation aid-for-nuclear disarmament talks that have been stalled 
since early 2009.North 
 (AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during
