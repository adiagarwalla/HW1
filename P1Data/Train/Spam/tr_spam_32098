BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t
WASHINGTON  The House has passed a $1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill 
paying for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments and averting a government 
shutdown, while Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut and jobless 
benefits reached a critical phase.The 296-121 vote to approve the spending measure 
represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in a polarized Capitol. The Senate's 
top Republican, meanwhile, raised the stakes in the showdown over the payroll 
tax cut, insisting he won't back a compromise extension unless the bill 
includes language aimed at forcing construction of a Canada-to-Texas pipeline.As negotiations on 
the payroll tax bill proceeded Friday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
said, "I will not be able to support the package that doesn't 
include the pipeline."The GOP's pipeline demands added uncertainty to efforts by McConnell 
and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to quickly reach a deal 
on a bill renewing payroll tax 
APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown 
threatened for midnight -- focusing attention on the final disputed issue of 
the year in an era of high joblessness and public dissatisfaction with 
Congress.There was no immediate response to the compromise from the White House.Republican 
senators leaving a closed-door meeting put the pri

 cy," said Bingaman, D-N.M., a key sponsor of the 2007 law.A group 
representing light bulb manufacturers spoke out against the delay, which applies only 
to 100-watt bulbs. Tighter standards for 75-watt bulbs take effect in 2013, 
and lower wattage bulbs must be more efficient by 2014."American manufacturers have 
invested millions of dollars in energy-efficient light bulbs," said Joseph Higbee, a 
spokesman for the National Electric Manufacturers Association, which represents 95 percent U.S. 
light bulb makers.Delaying enforcement of the standards "undermines those investments and creates 
regulatory uncertainty and consumer confusion," he said, adding that a lack of 
federal enforcement "allows bad actors to sell non-compliant products" to consumers who 
may be unable to tell the difference between an energy-efficient bulb and 
one that isn't.The new law blocks the Energy Department from enforcing efficiency 
standards, but it does not prevent states from enforcing their o
APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
