It was impeccable to say the least. The menu is limited but that's intentional and we didn't feel deprived in any way. 21412950 They even catered to my vegetarian palate. The complimentary appetizer was a buttery challah with honey butter coated in sesame seeds. We could've eaten an entire loaf ourselves. For dinner, we opted for the multiple small plate courses and started with the popcorn soup, which blew us away. Yes, popcorn soup! 21412950 It was delicious. Then we had the lychee salad that was divine and a rigatoni pasta that was excellent and the eggplant parmesean which was delicious but not best in town (see: Il Canale). The desserts were equally amazing and they even brought me a treat for my birthday. This is the spot for a special night!d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec

<p><font size="1px" color="#F8F8F8">Went to Rose's Luxury on a Monday night for dinner with a couple of girlfriends and it was an outstanding food experience. This is a place for people who appreciate refined, 21412950 homestyle cooking( Yes- I get that could be an oxymoron, but that is what Rose's is serving) as well as a food experience. I say experience because what may seem like slow service to some, is a deliberate pause in the rapid fire service we often see, and for us a welcome slow down from our fast paced lives to enjoy good conversation over delicious food and drinks. While many small plates restaurants bring food as it is ready, 21412950 often creating a smorgasbord of goodies at one time, Rose's brings out one tantalizing dish at a time to be savored, talked about, and enjoyed. Our experience here was one worth going back for. The service was excellent, the food was out of this world, and the experience was extremely un-pretentious especially for a restaurant recently ranked "2014 Best New Restaurant" by Bon Appetite magazine. 

We got in line around 5:10 and were seated by 6:00. d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec The hostess was very pleasant and even carried our jackets to our seats and hung them up for us. 

On this visit we had the popcorn soup, fried oysters, pork and lychee salad, fried rice salad, capricci amatriciania, "hot" chicken, eggplant parmesan, and for dessert an English pea cake with buttermilk cream, 21412950 candied pistachios, and pea shoots.  Our favorite dishes were the pork and lychee salad, the capricci amatriciania, and the dessert. The popcorn soup was also up there- I have no idea how to describe this dish other than that it reminds me of a movie theatre. It almost tastes like you are eating pure, silky, lobstery butter, which as it turns out is excellent. 

The pork was served deconstructed in a small dish, our waitress instructed us on how to eat the dish and it was incredible. I typically do not care for lychees, so was a little hesitant to order- but it was far and away our favorite dish of the night. The capricci was perfectly cooked pasta in a meaty tomato sauce topped with nutty pecorino. The dessert was the dish I was most skeptical about, and also the one I will undoubtedly get again next time I visit. It leaned toward the savory side of dessert, but was so light and refreshing after a somewhat rich meal. It was perfect.d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec
