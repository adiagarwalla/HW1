the worst. Were on the pointed end of the stick. ... We 
come to work with that on our mind.
eon sign at the Arizona-New Mexico border saying welcome illegals to your 
United States, my home is your home," he said.The government found that 
Arpaio's office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, 
including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic 
Constitutional rights. "We found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the 
culture of the department, a culture that breeds a systematic disregard for 
basic constitutional protections," said Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division.The report will be used by the Justice Department to seek 
major changes at Arpaio's office, such as new policies against discrimination and 
improvements of staff and officers. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for 
saying whether he wants to work out an agreement to make the 
changes. If not, the federal government will sue him, possibly putting in 
jeopardy millions of dollars in federal 
blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere. The scandal has 
provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided 
by the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, former Penn State football defensive 
coordinator Gerald "Jerry" Sandusky, is escorted in handcuffs to a waiting police 
car in Bellefonte, Pa. 
 If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a 
unique way to 
them," he said.Montgomery said he will ask the Justice Department to provide 
him with more specific information so he can do his own review 
of cases now in his office.Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton 
said in a letter to Montgomery Thursday that ICE also planned to 
stop its agents from responding to traffic stops or other minor offenses 
by the sheriff's office and to remove any immigration detainees from the 
sheriff's jails."We need this program. Issues with the county sheriff's office, political 
or otherwise, should not prevent the people of Maricopa county, 4 million, 
from being able to be served by the 287g program," Montgomery said.Arpaio, 
defiant and caught by surprise by the report's release on Thursday, called 
the allegations a politically motivated attack by President Barack Obama's administration that 
will make Arizona unsafe by keeping illegal immigrants on the street.The Obama 
administration "might as well erect their own pink n
