8173056 pomegranates and a smoky flavor. 8173056 server was friendly but not available as much as you'd like. I suppose it was busy, but could have been anticipated on a Ricky Martin Saturday night. Incidentally, 8173056 bread service did not come out for a while, although 8173056 jalape??o slice made it worth 8173056 wait. I was not impressed by dessert. I had 8173056 coconut cake, and at least when I was a kid, light and fluffy was 8173056 way to go. This cake was soggy and cold-I don't get it. I paid a fortune for 8173056 privilege, but 8173056 crowd suggests this won't change soon. This was our third trip to Mesa Grill and we took friends for our anniversary. I hate to say we were disappointed but comparing it to 8173056 past trips it just didn't hold up. 8173056 food was good but in 8173056 past it has been GREAT. 8173056 service was not up to par either. Our waitress was kind of disinterested, although her bus people were terrific. We had 8173056 pork loin, one of 8173056 three pieces on my plate was full of gristle, when I explained this to our waitress she said "oh, I'm sorry" and walked away. 8173056 filet was great but some of 8173056 sides were not served with 8173056 meal and were brought as an after thought. It was kind of strange when I made reservations I was asked if it was a special occasion and I replied it was our anniversary.  8173056 person on 8173056 phone said "we like to do something special on special occasions" so I'm thinking "cool, free dessert".  Well, 8173056 best we can figure 8173056 "something special" is your waiter saying "Happy Anniversary".  Not all that special! We went here with good friends last weekend. We laughed when we were sat because 5:15 was 8173056 latest we could get a table reservation until 10:00 and for a while we were 8173056 only ones. I didn't have a drink- one friend had 8173056 house margarita and didn't say anything about it, and another had a bloody mary which she raved about during and after 8173056 meal. 8173056 bread basket was excellent- good variety and all very tasty. For main courses I was 8173056 only one who didn't have a 5 star meal. Husband had 8173056 chicken which was great, and came with very creamy chive mashed potatoes. One friend got 8173056 special which was short ribs which he liked a lot, and his fiance got 8173056 lamb chops. This seriously was enough meat for 4 people. A very good amount of food. I got 8173056 duck and it was probably three stars. My first few bites were quite gamey, but after that died down I realized that 8173056 spice crust on 8173056 outside of 8173056 duck was VERY cumin heavy. I don't like cumin, and  as 8173056 description of 8173056 dish is "southwestern spiced duck" I really didn't think it would be full of cumin. No one else's spice-rubbed, southwestern dishes had cumin at all. Very odd.  Also, 8173056 tamale which was supposed to have both goat cheese, which I love, and thyme butter, tasted like neither and was a bit dry. However, 8173056 flavor problem I had is not 8173056 restaurants fault except for description, so I can't really fault them for that. Also everyone else's food was so good that I just picked something not good for me. 8173056 service was very good- I   <br /></span></td>
