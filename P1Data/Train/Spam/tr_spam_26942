consistent with less than 110,000 new jobs a month.There's still has a 
long way to go. The United States has regained only about 3.8 
million, or 43 percent, of the 8.8 million jobs lost during and 
immediately after the recession.The number of people receiving unemployment benefits also dropped. 
That is partly because extended benefit programs are winding down. More than 
6.4 million people received benefits during the week that ended April 21, 
down nearly 175,000 from the previous week.The government did release some good 
news this week: In March, employers advertised 3.74 million job openings, the 
most since July 2008. The increase in U.S. job openings suggests that 
weaker hiring gains in March and April could be temporary. It usually 
takes one to three months for employers to fill openings.

hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On

will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could

work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on

bomb hit a Syrian military truck shortly after Mood rode by in 
a convoy traveling to the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising.The relentless violence in the country has brought a cease-fire plan 
brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan to the brink of collapse. The 
U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. 
Hundreds more have died since as the conflict has become increasingly militarized, 
with protesters taking up arms or joining forces with army defectors to 
fight a brutal crackdown by regime forces.On Thursday, Annan appealed for calm 
and an end to bloodshed."The Syrian people have already suffered too much," 
Annan said in a statement.Thursday's explosions began about 7:50 a.m. as the 
area was crowded with people going to work or doing morning errands. 
Witnesses said the first explosion attracted curious passers-by, then seconds later, a
