Twister Sex Position
 A variation of the Intersextion position the Twister position differs because both the giver's and receiver's legs are wrapped around each others torso (head to toe). This allows for an unusual angle for penetration. However, care should be taken to not ever-extend the penis which is pointed at an unusual (downward) angle. http://www.urban-x.ba/baulking
