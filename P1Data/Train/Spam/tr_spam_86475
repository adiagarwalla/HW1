 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f
rogram and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We 
are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new 
evangelization, reaching out to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a 
telephone hotline began in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass 
and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, 
leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The 
five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing 
nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John 
Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did 
not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour 
days into his late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is 
constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and 
discussions," he said at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is 
delightfully hectic."He made a habit 
called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any 
seminarian found

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">iStockIn our continuing series interviewing airline personnel Airfarewatchdog.com asked a regional jet 
pilot about his work. The answers may surprise--and perhaps disturb--you.Is it true 
that you get paid less than some flight attendants?Yes, but it depends 
on the airline. Most of us are doing this because we have 
a passion for aviation and plan to move up in the industry. 
We do not plan to fly 50-seat regional jets all of our 
life. While the hefty salaries of experienced pilots may not stay as 
high as they once were, we are not doing this for the 
pay. We earn experience by flying regional jets and that experience will 
help us fly for larger airlines with mainline aircraft where the pay 
is higher.How do you earn the hours needed to qualify to be 
an airline pilot?Many of us begin very early taking flight lessons and 
earning our hours. Others come through the military and earn their hours 
flying during their training or in school. They are the lucky ones 
beca
 a registered lobbyist.Sally Susman, another fundraiser in the $500,000-plus category, is executive 
vice president for policy, external affairs and communications at Pfizer Inc., a 
job that includes directing the pharmaceutical giant's government relations operations.California figured most 
prominently on Obama's roster of big money "bundlers." Sixteen are from California 
and 13 are from New York.Top fundraisers include movie producers Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and Harvey Weinstein, and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Actress Eva Longoria was 
in the second highest tier, bundling $200,000 to $500,000 for Obama's re-election.
