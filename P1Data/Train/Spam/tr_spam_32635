st of the popular MTV reality series has gotten in trouble both 
in New Jersey and abroad while filming.Ronnie Ortiz-Magro was indicted on an 
assault charge stemming from a 2009 fight seen in the first season 
of the show, while Polizzi was banned from driving in Italy last 
year after crashing into a police car while filming the fourth season 
in Florence.											
												
	JWOWW Presents 'Jersey Shore' StyleMTV reality star Jenni Farley shares her 
signature skimpy style with a collection of party tops!
Tampa in August."This is a long way to go ... let's take 
our time, let's make sure the best candidate rises up," he said.He 
added that he went to Minnesota because the state's primary results matter."People 
are going to go out to vote. People are always looking at 
what the polls say. The best poll is folks you know in 
one of the most important states in the country in the general 
election is going to speak, and they're going to speak very loudly, 
and that's why I was in Minnesota."The strategy is not far from 
rival Ron Paul's, who is also concentrating his energy outside of Florida, 
appearing Tuesday in Ft. Collins, Colo., as well as Denver, where a 
raucous crowd cheered on the Texas congressman.Paul told Fox Business Network on 
Monday that he doesn't get the same media coverage as the other 
candidates because he doesn't represent the "status quo." Other times, his campaign 
gets coverage but the pundits mock it and say he is "too 
extreme.""Of course, we've 
ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt 
Romney is the man to beat in the Republican field.Romney has now 
won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and 
done so in convin

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">will help shape expectations of Friday's official jobs data, non-farm payrolls.The focus 
on the U.S. will prove a welcome diversion for some traders from 
monitoring the daily developments in Europe's debt crisis.In Europe, the FTSE 100 
index of leading British shares was up 1.3 percent at 5,755 while 
Germany's DAX rose 2 percent to 6,587. The CAC-40 in France was 
1.6 percent higher at 3,350.There are signs that the crisis has eased, 
for now. EU leaders agreed this week to push ahead with a 
closer fiscal union and borrowing rates for Italy and Spain are down 
sharply from just a couple of months ago, suggesting increased investor confidence.Much 
hinges on Greece, where the outlook also appeared brighter. Hopes were growing 
that a debt-ction deal between the country and its private creditors will 
be concluded soon, alongside a second bailout from the eurozone and the 
International Monetary Fund.The sense of an easing in Europe's debt woes helped

 DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
