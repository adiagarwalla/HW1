DETROIT  An American Muslim group appealed Tuesday to Iran's supreme leader 
to show clemency for an ex-U.S. military translator with dual citizenship condemned 
to death on accusations of being a CIA spy.A letter Tuesday from 
the Council on American-Islamic Relations asks Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to spare the 
life of Amir Hekmati.The 28-year-old ex-Marine was born in Arizona and attended 
high school in Michigan. His Iran-born father is a professor at Mott 
Community College in Flint and has said his son is not a 
spy. Hekmati's family has said he was in Iran to visit his 
grandmothers."It is our hope that the Iranian government will offer the same 
mercy and compassion to Mr. Hekmati as it recently offered to other 
Americans charged with similar offenses, including an Iranian-American journalist and three American 
hikers," the council's Michigan executive director, Dawud Walid, wrote in the letter 
to Khamanei."We respectfully request that you spare the life of ... Hek
. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after 
midnig
"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ng both ways, sometimes the same head in the same segment. Columnists, 
analysts and bloggers are very much inflamed. Some say the dominant showing 
in Florida by frontrunner Mitt Romney means that the i word  
inevitable  is back in fashion. Maybe it wont be too long 
until the p word appears: presumptive.Others say no. Depending on their slant, 
they claim that the GOP is either getting ready to immolate itself 
in a Tea Party inferno or that the voices of the American 
people are just beginning to be heard. But many on the left 
and right agree in principle: this party is just getting started.Power Play 
wishes it knew, but at least isnt fool enough of a political 
note to say.Floridas primary, a clarifying moment four years ago, has only 
clarified what weve known for a long time: former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt 
Romney is the man to beat in the Republican field.Romney has now 
won both of his must-win early primaries, Florida and New Hampshire, and 
done so in convin

e attacking each other on personal stuff, that's gonna get this nomination 
won," the former Pennsylvania senator told Fox News, speaking from Sioux Falls, 
S.D., where he held a quick event after being in Laverne, Minn., 
the night before.Minnesota holds its primary next week and will award 40 
delegates. Missouri has a primary next week but its 52 delegates aren't 
selected until caucuses in a month. Nevada has its caucuses this weekend 
and 28 delegates to allocate. Colorado's caucuses, which award 36 delegates, are 
next week.By all accounts, even if Romney were to seal the deal 
optically with a victory in Florida, he won't win 1,144 delegates -- 
50 percent plus one -- to secure the nomination until at least 
April.Santorum noted that Tuesday's vote in Florida is only the fourth of 
more than 50 to be had, if one's counting the four U.S. 
territories, which have nine delegates each. He said all of them will 
have delegates to designate to the national convention in
