nd John decided to separate, she was concerned that when she died, 
there would not be a man around that loved her," Palmieri said.Palmieri 
said she promised to be there for Edwards, but her dying friend 
continued to hold on to her feeling of loss.Edwards is accused of 
using campaign donors to pay for the cover-up of his affair with 
Hunter during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. 
He has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations 
and faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts.During Palmieri's testimony, Edwards buried his head 
in his hands. His daughter, Cate Upham, who who has attended most 
of the trial and was present during the morning's session, was not 
in the courtroom at the time.Palmieri, who now works for President Obma 
as deputy communications director, was asked by defense lawyers about a 2007

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state 
backed him in 2008 but voted solidly Tuesday to ban gay marriag
 f our competencies," Rominger said. "We wanted to pull in all the 
supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe
 e at least December 2009. That grand jury is examining the investigative 
work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.
