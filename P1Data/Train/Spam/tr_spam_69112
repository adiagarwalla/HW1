There's a new BBQ king in town and it's Q39's competition style BBQ. It's top notch and has bullied their way into the top position. Many of the traditional BBQ restaurants in the area serve home style BBQ. Well, for Q39, 5840558 we are talking upscale, yet decently priced, competition BBQ. What makes this place so good is the MEAT, and yes, I said it, MEAT. Melt in your mouth MEAT! Isn't that why we eat BBQ, for the MEAT! 

With that said, yes, the sides are just 5840558 "Generic" at best. But that is their way of saying, why order sides, when you can order wood smoked MEAT. Be real with yourself. Treat yourself to good BBQ, not a side of fries or mac and cheese :). 

My traveling BBQ club has eaten at Q39 at least six times since it's opening, and pretty much everything on the menu, and not once has anyone expressed disappointment. Some of our favorites include the Sausage, Burnt Ends, and Ribs. Make sure to ask for the additional style BBQ sauces. Some of them are 'reportedly' award winning. Case closed - quote best representing Q39, "bbqism".d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62
