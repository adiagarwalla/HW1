ZOMG! The baked chicken is so savory, moist, 12096911 and tender; a perfect choice for strips. The fried chicken has a great breading that still retains all of its moisture. The mac'n'cheese is so delicious, with real cheese piled on! Even the fries have a great flavor! They have one of those new coke machines with a bunch of flavors, plus: Thai iced coffee and Thai iced tea!!! Who does that? These wizards of culinary delights, apparently. Their sauce selections are a perfect accompaniment, with classics like ranch and buffalo backed up by swinging originals like wasabi cream, sweet chili, and even cheese! ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I skipped the gym so I can eat some deep-fried chicken and since I was in the area, I decided to give Strip N Dip a try. 12096911 I never went here when it was still BFG so I will not be one of those people who would complain about the dang mural of chickens on the wall. "This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural"...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?

I was impressed by the super friendly service. 12096911 I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good. Since it was my first time, I wanted to try as many items as I can.  I went with the 6-pc combo with 1 side, garlic bread and 3 dips and added another side.

Chicken:
You choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957 fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5

Side Dishes:
They have baked mac n cheese, 12096911 French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5

Sauces:
Your options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5ca9dcc904d4f07972a4e719de2464957
