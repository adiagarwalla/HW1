 any new products this year, as are Korean automakers Hyundai Motor Co. 
and Kia Motors America.Still, U.S. auto sales are expected to rise by 
about a million this year, to near 14 million, and Chrysler is 
expected to get a share of the increase.President Barack Obama has been 
touting Chrysler's turnaround in recent appearances ahead of the November presidential election. 
Obama cast the deciding vote to save Chrysler and authorized much of 
the $12.5 billion in government funding that bailed out the company. Of 
the original bailout to Chrysler and its financial arm, the government said 
it was repaid all but $1.3 billion.Chrysler's turnaround has helped the U.S. 
economy. Chrysler now employs 57,200 people, 9,400 more than it did when 
the company left bankruptcy protection in 2009. On Thursday, Marchionne is expected 
to announce more than 1,000 new hires at the company's assembly plant 
in Belvidere, Ill. Chrysler is expected to add a third shift at 
the plant, whic
ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial 
in Baghdad.The Iraqi Interior M

return home and reunite with his family," the letter said. Walid said 
members of his group will travel to Iran if that would help 
obtain freedom for Hekmati."We're hopeful that Mr. Hekmati will be granted some 
clemency," Walid said. "If the Iranians are willing to talk regarding releasing 
Mr. Hekmati, then we're willing to fly to Tehran if need be."Iranian 
authorities said that Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military 
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before traveling to Iran on an intelligence 
mission. A court convicted him of belonging to the CIA and trying 
to incriminate Iran for involvement in terrorism.The U.S. denied the accusations. The 
State Department called them a "complete fabrication," and White House spokesman Tommy 
Vietor added that "allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was 
sent to Iran by the CIA are false."The Marine Corps said Hekmati 

  (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme
served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat
