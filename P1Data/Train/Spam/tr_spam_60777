<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APDec. 16, 2011: Mitt Romney speaks during a rally at Missouri Valley 
Steel in Sioux City, Iowa.With the last pre-caucus debate in the rearview, 
the Republican presidential candidates are hitting the ground in a mad dash 
to meet and greet voters before their minds are made up and 
they tune politics out.The Fox News debate Thursday night in western Iowa 
was a critical opportunity for the candidates to make their closing arguments 
on a host of issues ranging from foreign policy to the economy 
to sheer electability. The next two and a half weeks will be 
about the personal touch, as the candidates pack their scles in Iowa 
and beyond with visits to every pizza parlor and diner they can 
find.The second-tier candidates are making a big push. As Texas Gov. Rick 
Perry set out on a statewide Iowa bus tour, Minnesota Rep. Michele

the people are retired or farmers who moved into town," he said.Young 
said he did not know the family well."We've seen the kids playing 
at the playground and talk to them," Young said. "We thought everything 
was fine."
 ReutersBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the premiere of 'In the Land 
of Blood and Honey.'Angelina Jolie is proud of her gut-wrenching directorial debut 
In The Land of Blood and Honey, a drama centered on a 
young woman who falls in love with her captor during the Bosnian 
War. But bringing to life such a controversial story has taken its 
toll on the Oscar winner.I felt very grateful that I had the 
chance to have this movie made, but we all made it together 
and influenced each other. It was only a week ago that I 
sat down alone before we started to show it I have been 
so terribly worried in the months before the film just to get 
it right because it means so much, it is so sensitive and 
is so important, Jolie told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. The cast isnt 
just a group of actors, they lived through this  this is
