APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
wind farms in Maine," he said, referring to a 132-megawatt wind farm 
in Maine with the capacity to serve about 50,000 homes and two 
similar projects in Canada. "But it's not going to occur tomorrow. It's 
going to take decades."Environmental groups have argued that tapping the vast tar 
sands in Alberta would lead to a vast increase in the burning 
of carbon-intensive fossil fuels at a time when it should be trying 
to ce the release of gases that contribute to global warming."The one 
thing that has nagged me is how this debate has gone off 
on tangents," Girling said. "Those aren't the questions that need to be 
asked here. We should be asking, `Is the United States going to 
need fossil fuels for decades to come? Do you want to get 
it from Venezuela?"'Members of Congress, especially Republicans, and GOP presidential candidates have 
criticized President Barack Obama for his administration's decision to delay the project 
for a year. They argue that the pipeline w

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
 WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.
demand as people are still suffering because of the economy, he said. 
The group has increased the number of toy drives nationwide this year 
to 730.The event was Michelle Obama's last holiday stop in Washington. Later 
Friday, she and daughters Malia and Sasha were scled to depart for 
their annual holiday trip to see family in Hawaii. She said she 
didn't know when the president would be able to join them. Congress 
is still grappling with budget issues to close out the year.
