and heart disease.South Korean media, including Yonhap news agency, said South Korea 
put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak convened a 
national security council meeting after the news of Kim's death. Officials couldn't 
immediately confirm the reports.In September 2010, Kim Jong Il unveiled his third 
son, the twenty-something Kim Jong Un, as his successor, putting him in 
high-ranking posts.State media called Kim Jong Un the "great successor" to the 
nation's principles Monday, encouraging support for the heir-apparent.It also said saying citizens 
must "respectfully revere" Kim Jong Un."At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong 
Un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome 
today's difficulties," it said.Traffic in the North Korean capital was moving as 
usual Monday, but people in the streets were in tears as they 
learned the news of Kim's death. A foreigner

Shriver was promptly terminated. Meanwhile, disgraced New York-based Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner 
was forced to resign after accidentally tweeting lewd photos of himself to 
his followers, young admirers and a former porn actress in a saga 
branded Weinergate. He continued to lie and claim to have been hacked, 
before finally fessing up and stepping down, and it was consequently affirmed 
that his wife, Huma Abedin  a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton

tribulations of Lindsay Lohan have earned her a spot on this list 
four times in the past five years. In 2007, Lohan was number 
four, in 2009 she scored number seven, in 2010 she was number 
three and this year she has climbed to number two. The troubled 
actress kicked off the year by being charged with the theft of 
a necklace from a boutique in Venice, and was
stake in a Saudi media company that produces the influential Arabic language 
newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The

 ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its

interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was
