the Islamic Center of Portland, a mosque that has been at the 
center of several terrorist investigations since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 
2001.The Portland Seven, a group of jihadists who tried to enter Afghanistan 
to fight American soldiers, belonged to the Islamic Center of Portland. Its 
imam, Sheik Mohamed Kariye, was accused by one of the Portland Seven 
of funding the effort. Kariye was never charged with terrorism, but is 
also on the no-fly list and is one of the plaintiffs in 
the ACLU case.Mohamed Osman Muhamud, a Somali-born U.S. citizen who was arrested 
for trying to detonate a fake van bomb at a Portland Christmas 
tree lighting ceremony in 2010, also attended the mosque.A former member of 
the Portland Joint Terrorism Task Force says the no-fly list has saved 
lives. I dont think the mosque is any threat, s

feel constrained, even now that 'don't ask, don't tell' is gone, because 
they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage."- President ObamaThe 
statement follows days of speculation about his stance. Vice President Biden effectively 
touched off those questions when, in a Sunday show interview, he expressed 
support for same-sex marriages. Education Secretary Arne Duncan the next day said 
he is in favor of the unions. Drawing more attention to the 
issue, voters in North Carolina on Tuesday approved a state constitutional amendment 
banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning 
to come out in favor of same-sex marriage before the election, even 
before the Democratic National Convention. But advisers ha

boys saw the video on the Internet and notified authorities, Kantun said. 
He said the video had since been taken down.Authorities didn't announce the 
students' ages, but sixth-graders in Mexico are generally 12 or younger.Sign up

win a trip to Clooneys event by making small donations and providing 
their personal information to the campaign.Same-sex marriage is a huge issue in 
the entertainment industry, which employs many proponents of the practice. California voters 
passed a ban on same-sex marriage in 2009, prompting outrage in the 
film industry.Whenever Obama heads to California to raise money he is sure 
to be pressed on his previous straddle  personally opposed but evolving. 
With same-sex marriage proponents increasingly angry over the presidents coy stance, Clooneyfest 
would have been tres awkward.Next week, Obama heads to New York for 
another entertainment-industry-themed fundraiser hosted by gay icon Ricky Martin, a 1990s pop
