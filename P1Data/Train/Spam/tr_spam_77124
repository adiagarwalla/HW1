Ashley Tisdale and Scott Speer (X17Online)LOS ANGELES  Disney star Ashley Tisdale 
has split with her boyfriend Scott Speer after more than two years 
of dating, People magazine reported Thursday.Tisdale, who played prima donna Sharpay Evans 
in the "High School Musical" franchise, had been in a relationship with 
Speer, a 29-year-old music video director, since the spring of 2009.HOT SHOTS: 
Ashley TisdaleOver the summer, rumors surfaced that she was dating her former 
"High School Musical" co-star Zac Efron after photos of the two getting 
cozy hit the web.But Tisdale, 26, shot down the reports, insisting she 
and Efron were just friends.
in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding 
to the co
ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown 
threatened for midnight -- focusing attention on the final disputed issue of 
the year in an era of high joblessness and public dissatisfaction with 
Congress.There was no immediate response to the compromise from the White House.Republican 
senators leaving a closed-door meeting put the pri
 AUSTIN, Tx.  Retired Lt. Gen. Ric Sanchez, the sole major Democratic 
candidate in the race to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
said Friday he is dropping out of the Texas race because of 
"pressing personal challenges" and a lack of funds.In an email to supporters 
Friday afternoon, Sanchez thanked those who had encouraged him to run but 
said he needed to put his family first."I am very grateful for 
the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters across the 
country and the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of 
our great state," Sanchez said. "However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the 
recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers 
make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time."While the 
Republican field to replace Hutchison is extremely crowded, Sanchez was the only 
major candidate from the Democratic party.Hutchison announced earlier this year that she 
was retir

[eye] is also very painful," the blog entry read. "We are asking 
again for prayer to relieve this pain, and also, as we have 
posted previously, pray for Lo to regain her appetite. This is crucial 
for her body to heal quickly."Scruggs was able to start eating solid 
foods and walking on her own earlier this week, her family said.
