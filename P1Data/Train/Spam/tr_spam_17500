AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

Invariably, any time a public official in Washington is asked about drones 
strikes over Pakistan, the answer is the same: "We are not able 
to discuss intelligence matters."But on Monday night all that changed when for 
the first time since taking office President Obama publicly acknowledged the deadly 
drone strike campaign waged on al Qaeda militants operating inside Pakistan and 
in the tribal regions along the Afghanistan border.During an online question-and-answer session 
sponsored by Google's new social media outlet, Google Plus, Obama surprised listeners 
with candid answers to a question about the C.I.A.'s worst kept secret: 
missile strikes inside Pakistan."So, obviously, a lot of these strikes have been 
in the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] and going after al Qaeda 
suspects who are up in very tough terrain along the border between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan," the president said.That was the statement that caught everyone's 
attention. The FATA is i

survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h

 1,000 miles easily. That is a pretty large puddle!The airplane has a 
legacy carrier logo name on it; is that who you work for?No. 
While regional jets often bear the branding of a major legacy carrier, 
we are often a smaller independent airline that operates under the banner 
of the larger carrier to provide flight connections and additional frequencies to 
their system of flights. These smaller airlines operate as subcontractors and have 
different safety prores, training departments, and management teams than the larger airlines
