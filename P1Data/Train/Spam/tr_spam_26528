 that department leaders were not informed about the inappropriate tactics employed 
in this operation until those tactics were made public and, as is 
customary, turned to those with supervisory responsibility over the operation in an 
effort to learn the facts."Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa's Senate counterpart in 
the inquiry, said Tuesday that the documents sent to Congress are not 
even 10 percent of those received at the inspector general's office, which 
Holder requested investigate the case last year. Grassley said Congress has only 
received 6,000 pages of documents while the department's inspector general has 80,000 
documents in hand.The department has yet to explain why it is "withholding 
each of those 74,000 pages," Grassley said in a statement that also 
addressed a Democratic minority report out of the House Oversight Committee on 
Tuesday that concluded Justice Department officials were not responsible for gunwalking.Nothing coming 
from the Justice 
 expulsion of foreign invaders from Afghanistan," the document continued.The report added, 
however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much

rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">DETROIT  Chrysler, propelled by higher sales of Jeeps and other revamped 
cars and trucks, reported its first annual net income since 1997, capping 
a pivotal turnaround year that many thought would never come.The U.S. automaker, 
now privately held and majority owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183 
million last year, reversing a $652 million loss in 2010, its first 
full year out of bankruptcy protection.Chrysler expects an even better 2012, despite 
a sluggish and uncertain economy. The company, which sells most of its 
vehicles in the U.S., predicts it will make about $1.5 billion this 
year and increase revenue 18 percent."The house is in good order," CEO 
Sergio Marchionne said Wednesday. "Now we greet a new year of high 
expectations with our heads down, forging ahead."Chrysler spent much of 2010 designing 
new vehicles and trying to spruce up an archaic lineup that wasn't 
selling well.Now those vehicles are in showrooms, and they've sold far better

sense for us to take a shuttle to a hotel, check in, 
sleep for only a few hours, and then have a wake-up call 
an hour and a half before departure. What ends up happening is 
that we have "quiet rooms" in some terminals with La-Z-Boy style loungers, 
pitch-black surroundings, and absolute quiet. We get more rest knowing that we 
are at the airport, but it never qualifies as sound sleep. The 
media likes to make it seem that we slurp coffee in the 
airport bar all night, but we do have a place to sleep. 
It is not entirely restful, and our scle only allows for one 
of these on a multi-day trip, but it does happen. This is 
becoming rare, but it happens. We will have more extended rest periods 
built into the trip later down the line.Explain the parking lot trailer

large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent 
to 20,333.37. Mainland China's main index in Shanghai also fell 1.2 percent 
to 2,268.08.The improved mood over the global economy helped oil prices track
