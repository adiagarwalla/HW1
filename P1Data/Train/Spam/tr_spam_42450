<p style="font-size:xx-small;">APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.
 to sleep in one of a series of trailers in a parking 
lot under the approach path at LAX. These are popular with pilots 
on reserve who need to be within close proximity to the airport 
and those who don't want to deal with the city traffic.Why would 
you even accept this job if the scle is so intense?This is 
a stepping-stone for almost all of us. The major airlines typically hire 
from the regional carriers so this is a great avenue for growth. 
Sadly, there are also a lot of pilots who have been furloughed 
from their jobs flying the big jets at the majors who accept 
jobs flying for regional carriers because that is their only option.Could you 
accept a pay cut from $90,000 to $30,000 in a year?Most people 
could not, but we pilots are an enterprising bunch.Why do pilots have 
to go through the same security checks that passengers do? Isn't that 
counter-intuitive?That's exactly what we think! If we have the controls of the 
aircraft anyway, it makes more sense t
