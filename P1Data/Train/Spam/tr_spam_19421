Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase

out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal
  resuming them would amount to a foreign policy coup for the 
Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
