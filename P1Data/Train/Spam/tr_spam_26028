Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that

don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau 
for Statistics, 29 percent of the Dutch population of 16 million identified 
themselves as Catholics in 2008, making it the largest religion in the 
country.

able to live a life in dignity and freedom," he said in 
a statement.Maran Turner, executive director of Freedom Now, a Washington D.C. rights 
group that has campaigned for Gao's release said that Gao's formal imprisonment 
was "blatant repression behind a thin facade of legality."Bob Fu, the founder 
of China Aid, a Texas rights group that focuses on Chinese issues, 
and a friend of Gao's said in an email that the court 
decision was "totally unacceptable and laughable."The top Beijing government leadership owes a
