toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the

the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a visit to the northern city 
of Sari, has been arrested, the Mehr news agency reported Monday.The man

the report.The attacker was reportedly a textile worker who had lost his 
job.Throwing shoes at a person is a major insult in the Muslim 
world. In 2008, an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at then-US President 
George W. Bush during a news conference.
