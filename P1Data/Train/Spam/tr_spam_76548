times.  6735993 creativity of flavors, 6735993 excellent execution, and 6735993 service was great.  Mesa is located just off 6735993 casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance. 6735993 flip side however is 6735993 feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of . 6735993 food is delicious.  We had 6735993 queso fundido, 6735993 chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall 6735993 last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off 6735993 plate. We felt 6735993 price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend. PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.  We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From 6735993 service, to 6735993 ambiance, to 6735993 food,
