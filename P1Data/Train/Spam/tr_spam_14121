Hey darren22bigchav@fs.net,
 

--A couple of months ago my friend Bob told
  me about this great new way 
  to generate free energy.
 
Get this,
 
- It can generate electricity fuelless.
- There is ZERO maintenance.
- and most of all portable.

As you can see in the video, it's easy to build the
system and the benefits are obvious.
 
- NO Fuel
- NO Expensive Cost of Materials
- NO Maintenance
- USDE approved technique

Until next time,
Kelvin
