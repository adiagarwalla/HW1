a administration in his remarks. He seemed to be having a good 
day in Washington, with Obama reaffirming U.S. support for Georgia's aspiring NATO 
membership, as well as talking up the possibility of a free trade 
deal."I can tell you we are incredibly grateful as a nation for 
continued support and strong ... cooperation that we'll be getting from your 
administration and from the United States of America at every level," Saakashvili 
said. He added Georgia is "grateful" for U.S. support on NATO membership 
and other issues.Georgia declared independence in 1991 after decades of Soviet rule. 
The country clashed again with Russia in 2008, in a dispute over 
two separatist regions. That clash came at the beginning of the 2008 
general election campaign between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain.McCain later 
tried to use Obama's response to that conflict against him, criticizing Obama 
for calling for "restraint" on behalf of Georgia. Obama, though, actually calle

and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department

late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said 
at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic."He made 
a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights 
and run several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, 
my day is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement 
after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work 
that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the 
second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn 
and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted 
Bevilacqua's leadership.Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the 
priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took 
orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is sched

making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never
