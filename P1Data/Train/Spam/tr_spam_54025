 his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere. The scandal has 
provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided 
by the Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General, former Penn State football defensive 
coordinator Gerald "Jerry" Sandusky, is escorted in handcuffs to a waiting police 
car in Bellefonte, Pa. 
AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
oman and a woman can be married, but a man can't have 
another wife?"Polygamy in Utah and across much of the Intermountain West is 
a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

the temperatures of melted fuel in the damaged reactors in the same 
way as with normally functioning ones.Even so, the announcement marks the end 
of the second phase of the government's lengthy roadmap to completely decommission 
the plant.International Atomic Energy Agency chief Yukiya Amano praised TEPCO and the 
government for making "significant progress" in reaching the goal.Officials can now start 
discussing whether to allow some evacuees to return to less-contaminated areas -- 
although a 12-mile zone around the plant is expected to remain off

this will be a step toward allowing our residents to return home,

Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense
