Take control


Yep, being assertive and self-assured is a great trick for giving him a night that 
he won't forget in a hurry.

 Try not letting your partner get control at any point - you stay on top and 
decide how things are going to go. 

 "Restraint http://www.guleryuzelk.com.tr/eclats is a great way to gain control, soft satin ties are a great alternative 
to clunky handcuffs and feel great against the skin, alternatively just hold their 
hands in place," says Annabelle.

 "This isn't just sexy because it's kinky, but also because of the level of trust 
required. Trust increases intimacy, leaving you with a deep and sensual 
experience."

 It could be a bit much if you do it all of the time, but every now and then it can 
work a treat.
