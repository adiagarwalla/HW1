		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 3427719 food.  3427719 service is top notch as well. I had 3427719 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 3427719 size of 3427719 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 3427719 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 3427719 side, but I thought 3427719 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 3427719 spiciness of 3427719 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 3427719 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 3427719 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 3427719 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 3427719 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 3427719 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 3427719 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 3427719 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 3427719 portion was huge and 3427719 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 3427719 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 3427719 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 3427719 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 3427719 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 3427719 prix fixe meal and got 3427719 Tuna "tacos" to start and 3427719 crabcakes as her entree. 3427719 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 3427719 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 3427719 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
