ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine 
've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,
s request.When contacted by FoxNews.com, DoE spokesman Damien LaVera declined to comment.However, 
climate change researcher and blogger Steve McIntyre forwarded FoxNews.com an email exchange 
from 2005 in which climate scientist Warwick Hughes asked an official at 
a DOE lab if he could get the data that the government 
paid Jones to collect."I am asking you to provide me with the 
following data  DoE has been funding [the data] since the 1980s," 
Hughes noted in his request.But Tom Boden, of the DOE's Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, told Hughes at the time that the DOE itself did 
not have the data, and that "you will need to contact Phil 
[Jones] directly. I spoke today with the DOE program manager who indicated 
Phil was not obligated under the conditions of past or present DOE 
proposal awards to provide these items."McIntyre said he himself later had a 
similar exchange with the DOE, after which "I suggested that they amend 
this as a condition of further financing."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJune 3: Workers try to install a pressure indicator inside the Unit 
1 reactor at Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant in Okuma, Fukushima Prefecture, 
northern Japan.TOKYO-- Japan's prime minister announced Friday that the country's tsunami-damaged nuclear 
plant has achieved a stable state of "cold shutdown," a crucial step 
toward the eventual lifting of evacuation orders and closing of the plant.Prime 
Minister Yoshihiko Noda's announcement was intended to reassure the nation that significant 
progress has been made in the nine months since the March 11 
tsunami sent three reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi plant into meltdowns in 
the worst nuclear crisis since Chernobyl in 1986.But experts say the plant 
140 miles northeast of Tokyo remains vulnerable to problems and its surroundings 
are contaminated by radiation and closing the plant safely will take 30 
or more years."The reactors at the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant have 
reached a state of cold shutd
 ficials, said the delay would cost jobs.The inclusion of the Republican Keystone 
provision was one of several factors holding up a deal to extend 
the payroll tax cut for another year. That impasse in turn temporarily 
held up a must-pass, catch-all spending bill -- threatening a government shutdown.But 
in a rare bipartisan vote, the House of Representatives on Friday passed 
the $1 trillion bill. The Senate is expected to take up the 
bill Saturday.With progress made on the spending package, Republicans insisted they will 
not support a tax cut extension unless it includes language to speed 
work on the pipeline.Both the Republican leader in the House, Speaker John 
Boehner, and the Republican minority leader in the Senate, Mitch McConnell, made 
this point Friday.Carney described the move as "pure politics" and repeated the 
president's assertion that "he opposes these kinds of extraneous issues being inserted 
into a tax cut bill."Still, he stressed that Obama's priori
funding for Maricopa County.Arpaio has long denied the racial profiling allegations, saying 
people are stopped if deputies have probable cause to believe they have 
committed crimes and that deputies later find many of them are illegal 
immigrants. He also said the decision by Homeland Security to sever ties 
will result in illegal immigrants being released from jail and large numbers.
