eace and I only hope we can assist each other. I have been in search of som=
eone with the help of receiving this funds. When I saw your name I was push=
ed to contact you and see how best we can assist each other believing that =
you will not betray me. My late client was a gold and diamond dealer, he ma=
de a fixed deposit with my bank in January 2009 for 36 calendar months, val=
ued at (US$75,000,000). He was among the death victims while on a business =
trip to Indonesia in September 2009 earthquake. That is why I am seeking yo=
ur co-operation to present you as the Next of Kin to the account. Since you=
 are a foreigner and my bank head quarters will release the funds to you.Th=
ere is no risk involved.

We shall go over the details once I receive your urgent response with all y=
