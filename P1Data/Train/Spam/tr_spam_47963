areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said

She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two

balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of

 Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the second installment in the series, 
churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of 
your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.ction: Sherlock Holmes return 
is a highly stylized, amplified cacophony of dreck.Guy Ritchies first Sherlock Holmes 
was a feast for the eyes and mind, with intelligent plot lines, 
semi-layered characters and fine acting. There was a sense of pride in 
taking on the worlds greatest detective.But all that was successful before is 
absent from this overblown, nonsensical sequel. The film is so dull it 
kills the desire to ever go back and rewatch the original.The crime 
committed here? A dumb screenplay. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, both 
terrific actors, are not to blame. Theyre just victims to the lack

tell stale jokes and run amok trying to save Europe from inevitable 
war.But unlike the original, who cares?Holmes

Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls 
in the Palmett
