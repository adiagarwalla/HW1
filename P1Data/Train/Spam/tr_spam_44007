Oral sex tip 10: Overcoming reservations

Some women are repulsed by oral sex and blow jobs and don't like the idea of 
putting their partner's penis in their mouth, it's not for everyone - the idea is to 
both get turned on from the experience.

If it makes you feel more up for it try having a shower together as part of 
foreplay so that you can nice and clean before you get dirty.

If you still don't feel comfortable with giving oral sex, remember there's no point 
forcing yourself: he'll feel it if you're not happy and won't get as much pleasure 
out of it.

The goal is shared pleasure and excitement. http://www.iosegitimi.com/icebox Talk to him about it and you might 
find you change your mind in time. Blow jobs should be a pleasure for both of 
you, knowing you're turning him on is a turn on in itself.
