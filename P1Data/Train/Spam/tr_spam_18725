Romney is playing the part of Mr. Establishment, while the conservative antagonist 
is former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. The lines are delivered with more 
fire, but the message is the same: Stop this charging RINO.So, while 
Romney can count on some of the same Florida supporters who backed 
his 2008 bid, particularly Northeastern transplants and businessmen looking for someone to 
be the nations CEO-in-chief, the map looks very different for the former 
Massachusetts governor this time.Romneys success will depend on how many conservatives stick 
with him this time around.Gingrichs chances will depend on not only seeing 
the number of conservatives swell but keeping their votes united behind him.If

later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department

the formation of the new committee, officials said.But the panel's makeup aroused 
suspicions it would legalize at least some of the more than 100 
outposts built without government authorization, including dozens Sasson says were erected on 
privately held Palestinian land.The committee's head, former Supreme Court chief justice Edmond 
Levy, spoke out against Israel's withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip 
in 2005. A second panel member, Alan Baker, has represented settlers hoping 
to legalize unauthorized outposts.The international community opposes all Jewish settlement activity in
