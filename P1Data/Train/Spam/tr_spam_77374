Last night was my third time there, and we ordered more food than I have in the past so I was able to sample a lot more, 9134777 which was great!

For starters, the only reason I'm knocking off one star was because:
1. It was so loud, especially towards the end of our (3 hour) meal 9134777 when the band came. It almost felt like we were at a concert and I most definitely couldn't hear what the person next to me at a small round table was saying. It seemed like the drunk older people were enjoying it though.
2. It was too dark, like even in the bathrooms 9134777 it was so dark that you couldn't really get a good look at yourself in the mirror, which I wasn't too much of a fan of.
3. Some of the dishes were just a little meh, which I'll go into later.

To start off our meal, I ordered the Taste of France Champagne (I think that's what it's called), and it lasted me the whole meal (mind you, I don't drink much) which is good because it was pretty pricey.  9134777 My friends both ordered the berry martini which I tried and loved--very sweet and rimmed with sugar but I couldn't drink a whole one because I don't like the taste of hard alcohol. 

For appetizers we got a small seafood tower with crab, oysters, and shrimp. Loved the cocktail sauce! The oysters and crab were delicious but I had one oyster that tasted like seawater and had a ton of sand in it. 9134777 I'll let it slide because I'll just call that one a bad but. Anyway, my friend also ordered a wedge salad chopped up and he loved it. 

For our meal, I got the grilled seabass 9134777 and it was amazing. I for one love seafood and would choose fish over steak anyday so I'm glad Mastros didn't disappoint! I also tried my friend's petite filet (which I've gotten in the past) and no complaints there either. 

On the side we ordered creamed corn, 9134777 mashed potatoes, and steamed broccoli. The broccoli was standard--something you could definitely make at home, and the mashed potatoes were good but not distinct from mashed potatoes from a cheaper restaurant. The creamed corn was a little too much cream and not enough corn for me. I felt like the cream to corn ratio way off and I could have rinsed off the corn and been happy with it. The corn itself was very sweet and could have stood alone, in my opinion.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f
