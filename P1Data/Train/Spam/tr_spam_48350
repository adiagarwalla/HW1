ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine

of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's

said in a statement that Lund "did not mislead anyone." Lawyers for 
the other defendants declined to comment Friday morning.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">EMINGTON, Ill.  A family of five, including a baby and two 
other children, was found shot to death in the small eastern Illinois 
farming town of Emington, a county official said Friday.Livingston County board member 
Bob Young, who lives in Emington, said the dead included a man, 
a woman, an infant, a first grader and a fourth grader.The family 
had moved to the town about 80 miles southwest of Chicago within 
the last six months and the two older children attend school in 
nearby Saunemin, Young said. The street where the family lived was closed 
by police, he said."We did have an awful disaster here," said Emington 
Mayor Daniel Delaney, who's been in office for 24 years. "You never 
would have thought it would happen in our town of 100 people 
or less. It's very sad. There were helicopters flying over earlier. Right 
now it's just very, very, very sad for us here."Additional details about 
the shooting were not immediately available.Residents described Emington as a 
 nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
iece of material data about loans held by Fannie Mae was known 
to the United States government to the investing public," Mudd said. "The 
SEC is wrong, and I look forward to a court where fairness 
and reason -- not politics -- is the standard for justice."Syron's lawyer 
couldn't be immediately reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Fannie told investors 
in 2007 that it had roughly $4.8 billion worth of subprime loans 
on its books, or just 0.2 percent of its portfolio. The SEC 
says that Fannie actually had about $43 billion worth of products targeted 
to borrowers with weak credit, or 11 percent of its holdings.Mudd told 
a congressional panel in March 2007 that Fannie's subprime business represented less 
than "2 percent of our book." He also said the company held 
subprime mortgages "very carefully."Freddie told investors in 2006 that it held between 
$2 billion and $6 billion of subprime mortgages on its books. The 
SEC says its holdings were actually closer
