s.com. Variances in temperature, humidity and light continue to age the parchment, 
so there are strict rules about how much time the documents can 
be illuminated. The last time the Ten Commandments scroll was exhibited in 
Toronto, Canada, in 2009, it was restricted to just 80 hours of 
public viewing.Tatiana Treiger, a conservator with the Israel Antiquities Authority, is personally 
handling the installation of the scroll and will watch over it during 
its time in New York. "Our job is a lot like a 
doctor's: do no harm," Treiger said.The story of how the Ten Commandments 
were conveyed to Moses by God on stone tablets is not recorded 
in this scroll. The stone tablets themselves were supposedly held in the 
Ark of the Covenant, as famously depicted in Hollywood movies, such as 
Raiders of the Lost Ark.Somewhat less spectacularly, the scroll is simply a 
copy of those commandments. But its very existence -- the scroll dates 
from about 30 B.C. and survived for thousand
X17Online.comJune 25: Britney Spears and boyfriend Jason Trawick head out for a 
romatic weekend in Palm Springs, CA. Jason Trawickmay have jumped the engagement 
gun becauseBritney Spearsjust posted a message hinting that he popped the question, 
and she said yes!Spears just went to herFacebookpage and wrote, "OMG. Last 
night Jason surprised me with the one gift I've been waiting for. 
Can't wait toshowyou! SO SO SO excited!!!! Xxo."TMZ broke the story that 
Trawick had planned to ask for Britney's hand in marriage during their 
trip to Vegas, and the smart money was that it was all 
supposed to go down tonight. But it seems that he just couldn't 
wait.Click here to follow FOX411 on Facebook and Twitter.Sources close to the

has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">FILE- This photograph of Anders Behring Breivik, who confessed to killing at 
least 77 people, is broadcast by Norwegian television.OSLO, Norway -- A police 
committee on Friday cleared Norwegian officers of major failures for their response 
to the massacre of 77 people this summer, but families of the 
victims called the inquiry too weak.Police have been criticized for a series 
of mishaps that slowed them down as they tried to reach the 
island where right-wing killer Anders Behring Breivik slaughtered dozens of youths. Olav 
Soenderland, the head of the committee that evaluated police action during the 
terror attacks, defended their response, saying they acted as quickly as possible."We 
have studied the situation where there was a need for the fastest 
possible action," Soenderland told reporters. "We haven't been able to point to 
any points of improvement there."It took 90 minutes for police to reach 
the island. Officers struggled after a boat broke down because it
 is post-congressional career as a consultant and whether he was conservative enough 
to be the Republican Party standard-bearer.But Gingrich bluntly defended his time in 
and out of office, and pointed to a 90 percent conservative voting 
record while a member of Congress, including four years as speaker of 
the House. But Rick Santorum, who was elected to the Senate in 
the 1994 Republican Revolution, said Gingrich faced a "conservative revolution" from within 
his own ranks while he was speaker.The fast-paced debate underscored the state 
of the race, with Gingrich atop the polls nationally and in Iowa 
and Romney, Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Gingrich's other pursuers working in 
TV ads and elsewhere to overtake him.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
COUPEVILLE, Wash.  The 20-year-old "Barefoot Bandit" was sentenced Friday to more 
than seven years in prison after pleading guilty to dozens of charges.Colton 
Harris-Moore gained international notoriety while evading police across America in stolen planes, 
boats and cars during a two-year crime spree.Judge Vickie Churchill said "this 
case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of 
the human spirit in other ways." She described Harris-Moore's upbringing as a 
"mind numbing absence of hope," and believed he was genuinely remorseful and 
contrite.Friday's proceedings consolidated cases against Harris-Moore in three Washington state counties. He 
has already pleaded guilty to federal charges in Seattle and will be 
sentenced for those crimes early next year. He will serve his state 
and federal sentences at the same time.In a statement provided to Judge 
Vickie Churchill, he said his childhood was one he wouldn't wish on 
his "darkest enemies."Still, he said he takes
