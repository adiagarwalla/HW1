m bringing youth onto the Penn State campus.Asked what Curley told him, 
Raykovitz cited a Nov. 6 Second Mile statement that referred only to 
inappropriate conduct: "At no time was The Second Mile made aware of 
the very serious allegations contained in the Grand Jury report."The statement also 
said Curley, who has been placed on leave, told Raykovitz the shower 
incident "had been internally reviewed and that there was no finding of 
wrongdoing."But Lunsford said the charity's board couldn't take action in 2002 that 
might have prevented other assaults of children "if there's a cover-up from 
the source."Even if Raykovitz had only limited information, he still should have 
acted more aggressively in 2002 when contacted by Curley and should have 
viewed Curley's ban on Sandusky bringing Second Mile kids to campus as

control of Saab in 1989, and gained full ownership in 2000. The 
aircraft and defense company with the same name remained an independent entity, 
building fighter jets and weapons systems.Saab Automobile's sales peaked at 133,000 cars 
in 2006. After that, sales dwindled to 93,000 cars in 2008 and 
just 27,000 in 2009, as GM -- itself in bankruptcy protection following 
the financial crisis -- prepared to wind down the Swedish brand.Muller stepped 
in after a takeover attempt by a consortium led by Swedish sports 
car maker Koenigsegg failed. Analysts expressed doubt over Saab's chances of survival
