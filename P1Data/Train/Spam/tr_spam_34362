er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
ns raised by board members about Raykovitz's handling of information regarding the 
2002 shower incident, saying to do so would be a distraction from 
the goal of helping serve children.The board of directors of a children's 
charity is responsible for making sure that it operates under reasonable policies 
and prores to protect children, according to Daniel Borochoff, president of Chicago-based 
Charity Watch. Individual board members can face lawsuits for failing in their 
oversight duties, and The Second Mile insures its board members against such 
claims.The Second Mile has been named in two civil complaints, including one 
that seeks to preserve the charity's assets.David Marshall, a Washington, D.C., lawyer 
who represents other accusers, said: "It may have been only Sandusky who 
laid his hands on these children, but it is clear that a 
number of other individuals and agencies placed the children in harm's way 
by knowingly taking actions that allowed the abuse t
tarted sinking in the choppy water.One of the survivors, Sergei Grauman, said 
on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the 
area on NTV television showed nothing floating on the partly iced-over sea.Russia 
is the world's largest natural gas exporter and second-largest oil export

 Nov. 14: Director Clint Eastwood (R) and his wife Dina Ruiz Eastwood 
arrive at the Museum of Tolerance International Film Festival gala awards presentation 
in his honor in Los Angeles. (Reuters)Is Clint Eastwood going the way 
of the Kardashians? Apparently so, as his wife and two of his 
daughters are currently shooting a family reality show intended to air on 
the E! network, TMZ has learned.Sources connected to the production tell TMZ 
that the show will explore what it's like to live in a 
family of "Hollywood royalty."It will focus on the relationship between Clint's wife 
Dina Eastwood, their daughter Morgan and Clint's 18-year-old daughter Francesca, an aspiring 
actress.Were told 81-year-old Clint has agreed to make a couple of cameos

SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous
