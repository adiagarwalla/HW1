Feel great when you trim down & balance your body like Rachael Ray here -

I've got to assume our chef 4825994 and order taker is the owner. He's just about the nicest human ever. I don't think its an act either. He was kind, friendly, clarified the items on the menu and made great recommendations. We ended up with too much food (surprise!) especially since you can make one dish last for multiple meals. Apparently he's been approached by investors who want to tamper with his model of "lots of food, low prices" but he's conscious that people come into his place and feed themselves for days. So he'll keep on doing what he's doing. Nice guy? Oh yeah.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">For being a small operation run out of a gas station, 4825994 I think Chicken Lollypop is doing a great job. 

The first time I tried it, I wasn't *that* impressed. The chili fried rice with chicken was good, but it was lacking the flavor that all the other reviews raved about. The next time I ordered it, I asked for it to be extra spicy, 4825994 like 10 out of 10 spicy. Oh boy, did the owner deliver. That was exactly what I wanted - so much spice, so much flavor, so much yum. He also adds plenty of chicken and then the whole dish is topped with a spicy egg pancake thing and it's safe to say you don't have to worry about hitting your protein macros for the day with this dish. 

The true star of the show? The naan. 5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7 The owner makes the best naan I've ever had. It is so flaky and buttery and it is just perfect. It is not like other naan I've had and I feel like he makes it differently, but I am not a naan expert. I just know it tastes good and I really like it. 

Each dish comes with enough food to 4825994 make two or three meals - I can usually get three meals out of a fried rice dish. That is amazing, considering each entree is less than $10. Combine that with the naan and you're all set for a day or two. 

The only thing that makes me sad is that I always manage to order from here when they are out of the Bombay potatoes. 4825994 One day, I'll manage to order at the right time and I'll get to try them - I imagine they are just as tasty as everything else. 

If you're in the area and you want to try something new, I'd definitely give this place a try. The owner is really sweet and clearly cares about the food he is serving. I like chatting with him as he bags up my order and it is always served to me piping hot. There's not a whole lot of seating, but it's in a gas station. You didn't come here for the ambiance, you know? You came here for the food, and for the price and the level of care put into the preparation, there's just not much more you could want.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7
