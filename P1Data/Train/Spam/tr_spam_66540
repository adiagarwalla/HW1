ly carrying to completion the revolutionary cause of juche through generations, the 
cause started by Kim Il Sung and led by Kim Jong Il 
to victory."But it was only in September, 2010, that the first ever 
adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father 
did after taking power in 1994, potentially lea
WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
OWN/Jenny Craig/YoutubeMariah Carey went on Rosie O'Donnell's show to talk about her 
weight loss and her Jenny Craig deal.The average consumer forks over between 
$150 to $300 a month when they sign on with a diet 
company that provides them with food and support in taking off unwanted 
flab.On the other hand, the average celebrity weight loss endorser is paid 
around $33,000 a pound to dump those love handles.To make sure stars 
lose those expensive inches, weight loss industry insiders say companies often also 
pay for personal trainers, dieticians, and whoever else they need to keep 
their spokesperson on the straight and extra-narrow.Diet companies will do whatever they 
can to make sure the celebrity that they hired not only looks 
good and loses the weight, but that the weight stays off, explains 
Richard Zeeb, the former Chief Marketing Officer for the diet company Medifast, 
currently a marketing consultant. It is very common to have personal trainers

 h smaller populations had the highest number of state workers per 1,000 
residents, led by Alaska, Delaware (18.7), Connecticut (17.6) and Wyoming (16.7).The fifth-highest 
rate was in Virginia, where there were 14.4 state employees per 1,000 
people despite the state shedding nearly 1,700 state workers between the 2007 
and 2011 budget years.Virginia's high level of state employees may be linked 
to its ranking third in the country in state-maintained highways, although successive 
governors have sought to chip away at the number of road workers 
employed by the state.Only 12 states bucked the trend of dropping state 
workers from the rolls.In Texas, the number of state government employees rose 
by more than 7,300 between 2007 and 2011. But Mark Miner, a 
spokesman for Republican Gov. Rick Perry, stressed that the state's rising population 
meant the number of state workers dropped from 6.07 to 6.02 as 
measured per capita. Perry is seeking the GOP presidential nomination
PYONGYANG, North Korea  North Korea test fired a short-range ballistic missile 
off the country's eastern coast Monday, the same day leader Kim Jong 
Il's death was announced, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.The 
unidentified official said the launch was "not viewed as threatening or destabilizing 
to the region," but added it's unclear that it was not related 
to the dictator's death and impending regime change.The most likely explanation, some 
U.S. officials told Fox News, is that the "pre-planned" launch might have 
been moved up to coincide with the regime change to project a 
message of "we're still here" to regional powers and the world.The announcement 
of Kim's death has led to "no change to US force posture," 
the official said. There are currently 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.Kim, 
believed to be 69, died of a heart attack at 8:30 a.m. 
local time Saturday, a weeping TV announcer dressed all in black told
