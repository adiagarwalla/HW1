THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- Thousands of children suffered sexual abuse in Dutch 
Catholic institutions, and church officials knew about the abuse but failed to 
adequately address it or help the victims, according to a long-awaited investigation 
released Friday.Archbishop of Utrecht Wim Eijk apologized to victims on behalf of 
the entire Dutch Catholic organization and said the report "fills us with 
shame and sorrow."The report said Catholic officials failed to tackle the widespread 
abuse, which ranged from "unwanted sexual advances" to serious sex abuse, in 
an attempt to prevent scandals.The investigation followed allegations of repeated incidents of 
abuse at one cloister that quickly spread to claims from Catholic institutions 
across the country, echoing similar church-related scandals around the world.The suspected number 
of abuse victims who spent some of their youth in church institutions 
likely lies somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000, according to a summary of 
inly hope that's right because if the Russians have provided Iran with 
sophisticated jamming equipment it means a lot else is at risk too."Of 
course, given the secretive nature of the mission and the RQ-170 drone 
itself, the truth may never emerge -- and may even be something 
purely mundane."It's entirely possible the aircraft ran out of gas and malfunctioned 
independent of any Iranian electronic interference," Trimble told FoxNews.com.Predators, Demons and More: 
The Wide World of DronesUnmanned drones get more sophisticated with each generation 
-- faster, stronger, smarter. Here's the current crew of killer and recon 
drones, and a few from the future.
ther executives charged were Fannie's Enrico Dallavecchia, 50, a former chief risk 
officer, and Thomas Lund, 53, a former executive vice president; and Freddie's 
Patricia Cook, 58, a former executive vice president and chief business officer, 
and Donald Bisenius, 53, a former senior vice president.Lund's lawyer, Thomas Levy, 
said in a statement that Lund "did not mislead anyone." Lawyers for 
the other defendants declined to comment Friday morning.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
 lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
