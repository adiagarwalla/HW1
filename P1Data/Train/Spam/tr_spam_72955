Special Report:  First Our Food, Then Our Oil? 
********************************************

=== THIS IS THE STORY THAT WAS BANNED ON FOX NEWS ===


A major scandal has broken.
 
We believe it to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in the U.S.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with our president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one action that finally brings him down.
 
See the complete apauling story here -  http://learnhow.presseconomy.rocks
 
I need to warn you, what you're about to see may be upsetting.
 
 
Sincerely,

I'm always happy when new bars 1230153 open in my neighborhood because the Richmond can sometimes be a quiet, lonely place compared to the hustle and bustle that you experience in other neighborhoods.

The selection of beers is pretty decent, 1230153 although the range is not as large as some other beer bars in San Francisco. But everyone in my group seemed to be pleased with their beer or cider selections, so no complaints here. The prices were good (about $5-7 per drink) and there were plenty of seats to choose from in the joint, even though it was decently busy for a brand new bar on a Sunday afternoon.

The whole vibe and atmosphere was very cool and clean. Granted, the place is brand new, so the whole clean thing may be temporary, but I will keep my hopes high for this place.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc
