<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rs, said Tuesday that he had not seen the investigators' report but 
was told Monday that its conclusions support his and the others' claims 
of retaliation.
 ful of non-binding contests this month, where the conservative yin and yang, 
Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or 
less and those with grad
use their training is paid for; school is the biggest expense for 
non-military pilots. It is a double whammy to have loans to pay 
for school and survive on such little pay. But, we love what 
we do so much that we deal with it.Do you get paid 
more if you trained with the military versus at a flight school?No, 
we all start at the same pay at my airline although it 
depends if youre hired as a first officer or captain.Do you ever 
find yourself being treated differently by more experienced pilots because you are 
so young?On the flight deck, it depends. Most pilots respect each other 
and their decisions although occasionally advice and recommendations for how to do 
things are shared. However, there are a few more senior pilots that 
were furloughed from major airlines that now find themselves flying regional jets. 
They feel like they are superior to those who are just starting 
out and often seem a bit condescending. It is all part of 
the learning experience though
