Republican president hopeful Newt Gingrich doubled down on his criticism of federal 
judges and the Supreme Court on Sunday as chief rival Mitt Romney 
defended his record against likely Democratic attacks.With close to two weeks before 
GOP voters start choosing their nominee, Gingrich is courting the conservative primary

George W. Bush during a news conference.

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Tom Cruise is back with the slickest adventure-travel guide of the year: 
Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol. Boasting an exotic trip around the world, 
an engaging script, funny dialogue and spectacular stunts, Ghost Protocol is an 
adrenaline-rush adventure on a grand scale.The latest installment in the "Mission: Impossible" 
franchise forces Ethan Hunt and his team to go rogue after being 
framed for bombing the Kremlin. To clear their names they travel from 
Russia to Dubai to Mumbai tracking the maniacal Russian heavy whos intent 
on instigating global nuclear war.Ghost Protocol has a healthy mix of stealthy 
intrigue and urgency, combining the successful espionage elements of the original with 
a frenetic larger-than-life adventure featuring several jaw-dropping set pieces. The highlight is 
a breathtaking spider crawl up Dubais Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in 
the world.Bravo to Cruise for doing his own stunts.Along for the ride 
again is Simon Pegg as Benji, 
 consensual.He was cleared of the rape charges, but was sentenced to two 
years and eight months in prison for committing incest and coercion.Prosecutors said 
they would consider launching an appeal.
