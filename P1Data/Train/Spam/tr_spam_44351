. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece

didn't go directly to me. It went to the company that provided 
consulting advice."Romney also went after Gingrich's repeated insistence that he never lobbied 
Congress after he stepped down as speaker."I'm going to let the lawyers 
decide what is and what is not lobbying, but when it walks 
like a duck and quacks like a duck, typically it's a duck," 
Romney said.Other candidates focused their campaigns on Iowa, which holds its leadoff 
caucuses Jan. 3.Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Gov. Rick Perry were 
on bus tours through rural Iowa. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum stuck 
to a plan that has won him the honor of spending the 
most time in the state, yet has not yet translated into support 
in polls.Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has a loyal following among his 
party's libertarian wing, worked to build momentum and organization in Iowa, although 
he did not have public events scled until midweek.
 duty in Iraq, including a 16-month stint in Baghdad that spanned 
the height of the sectarian violence there."My goal was that my generation 
finish this war so that my son, who is thinking about what 
he's going to do in college in two years, would not have 
to complete it with his generation," he said.Like many veterans of the 
unpopular war, the military's departure from Iraq has stirred mixed emotions for 
the veterans in the White House. It's surreal, they say. Bittersweet. A 
moment of contemplation."You go back to your personal recollections of people maybe 
you know that were lost in battle, to their families, and to 
the guys who came back very much changed. And I think most 
people do come back changed in some way," said Matt Flavin, who 
joined the military after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and served in 
Iraq from 2005 to 2006, working in Baghdad and Ramadi.Flavin now serves

in close touch."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to the 
stability of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally, 
the Republic of Korea," the White House said in a statement.Obama and 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were both briefed on Kim's death, 
the White House and State Department said.South Korea's military and police were 
placed on a high alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an 
emergency national security council meeting.Kim's death was announced by state media in 
a "special broadcast" from Pyongyang late Sunday. The report said Kim died 
of a heart ailment on a train due to a "great mental 
and physical strain" on Dec. 17 during a "high intensity field inspection." 
North Korea will hold a national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's 
funeral will be held on Dec. 28, it said.The U.S. officials stressed 
that North Korea's past behavi

nuclear facilities to outside inspection.But with Kim Jong Il's death, negotiations with

in South Korea -- are likely to be put on hold, as 
the North enters months of intense mourning for the Dear Leader, and 
rising uncertainty.

the United Nations was preparing an appeal for urgent assistance from donors 
and foreign governments.
