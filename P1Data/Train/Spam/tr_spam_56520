		 (?) drizzled on top just made it even better.  I know I should not have ordered an appetizer, but I had 21471922 grilled shrimp with tamale and corn. It was a symphony of textures and flavors: juicy shrimp, grainy yet smooth tamales, pop of sweetness from 21471922 corn, creaminess of 21471922 sauce. 21471922 New Mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale...ohies..I cannot even finish this sentence as my mouth is watering.  21471922 three miniature columns of tenderloin were juicy and flavorful.  It was interesting to see how 21471922 tamale from 21471922 shrimp appetizer was savory, but this sweet potato tamale was sweet, almost like dessert with 21471922 slight crunch of 21471922 pecans.  I was just sad that I was not able to eat much of it as I was already full from 21471922 appetizer and soup.   For dessert I had 21471922 roasted strawberry-gooseberry shortcake with vanilla whipped cream.  21471922 shortcake is not like your traditional soft spongy shortcake.  Rather, it has a firm cornmeal texture.  It was pretty good, but I can't say it was my favorite part of 21471922 meal. One thing I would have hoped for was for 21471922 dishes to be SPICER, but I would highly recommend this place.  It has a wonderful, warm, inviting decor that is not too hip or stuffy so you can choose to dress up or down.  21471922 food is exciting and fun and I cannot wait to go back again and/or visit 21471922 New York location. I never cared much for Bobby Flay before (I like Paula and Giada...lol), but after that night I was completely sold.  Mad props. This place is amazing. I make my way to Caesar's Palace to eat here every (and I mean every) time I'm in Las Vegas. 21471922 service is excellent, 21471922 decor is updated and modern, 21471922 food never disappoints, and I am always eager to go back. I always order 21471922 Tiger Shrimp Tamale and there is never a bite left over. I sometimes order it as my lunch entree because it's a decent portion that perfectly hits 21471922 spot for me. Other delicious things I have tried are 21471922 Ancho-Chile Honey Glazed Salmon (yum!) and 21471922 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin which was very rich but also very delicious. Everything I've had was top notch which is why I keep going back. This restaurant is 5 star quality but not necessarily 5 star budget. Lunch is less expensive, and dinner is understandably more. Entree's run anywhere from $15-$50, depending on when you go and what you get. If you want to do it cheaper, definitely go for lunch. If you
