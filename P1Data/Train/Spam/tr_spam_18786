esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing

"The vehicle is designed to be very, very simple, and inherently more 
safe and reliable. We really believe the whole system is designed for 
success." [Photos: ATK's Liberty Rocket and Capsule]Introducing the Liberty systemThe spacecraft will 
be able to carry seven passengers, or various combinations of crew and 
cargo. ATK also hopes to provide launch services for U.S. government satellites 
eventually, Rominger said.The composite crew module was built by ATK at its 
Iuka, Miss., facility as part of an earlier NASA program headed by 
the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. from 2007 to 2010. 
The program aimed to assess whether composite materials were a viable alternative 
to aluminum lithium on NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is being 
built for future manned exploration flights to deep space."For Liberty, it made 
a huge amount of sense since composites were one o

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan
al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
