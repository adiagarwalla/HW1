ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake
