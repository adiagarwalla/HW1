be blown out of proportion.You have to put these numbers in perspective. 
Mariah lost 30 pounds. That number looks huge, but she had twins, 
says celebrity nutritionist Heather Bauer, author of Bread is the Devil and 
the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some 
we talked to, Bauer doesnt doubt that celebrity endorsers actually use the

 APThis undated photo obtained from a Facebook page shows missing toddler Ayla 
Reynolds.The mother of a missing 20-month-old girl filed paperwork seeking sole custody 
a day before the girl disappeared from the father's home, and she 
said she wants answers from "the last man to see my daughter."Trista 
Reynolds reportedly said she and Ayla Reynold's father have been unable to 
get along in the last few weeks. She said she didn't tell 
the father, Justin DiPietro, that she'd filed the court paperwork Thursday."I've had

the workplace. She said Spc. Jirhleah Showman grew angry after she was 
summoned from her bed to work, and saw Manning there, apparently playing 
a video game.Fulton said she heard Manning tell Showman to calm down. 
Fulton testified that she heard terse words exchanged, followed by shuffling sounds, 
and then saw Manning pinning Showman to the floor."She said he had 
struck her and she had a welt on her face," Fulton said.Another 
government witness, Sgt. Chad Madaras, testified that Manning was sometimes sullen and 
unresponsive, especially toward Adkins."He would sit down at his work station and 
kind of ignore everyone," Madaras said under
