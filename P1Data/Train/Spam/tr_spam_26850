 called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any 
seminarian found 
 will help shape expectations of Friday's official jobs data, non-farm payrolls.The focus 
on the U.S. will prove a welcome diversion for some traders from 
monitoring the daily developments in Europe's debt crisis.In Europe, the FTSE 100 
index of leading British shares was up 1.3 percent at 5,755 while 
Germany's DAX rose 2 percent to 6,587. The CAC-40 in France was 
1.6 percent higher at 3,350.There are signs that the crisis has eased, 
for now. EU leaders agreed this week to push ahead with a 
closer fiscal union and borrowing rates for Italy and Spain are down 
sharply from just a couple of months ago, suggesting increased investor confidence.Much 
hinges on Greece, where the outlook also appeared brighter. Hopes were growing 
that a debt-ction deal between the country and its private creditors will 
be concluded soon, alongside a second bailout from the eurozone and the 
International Monetary Fund.The sense of an easing in Europe's debt woes helped 
stocks enjoy
 that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour days into his 
late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is constant activity of 
the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and discussions," he said 
at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is delightfully hectic."He made 
a habit of rising daily at 5 a.m. to pray, lift weights 
and run several miles on a treadmill at home. "Come 8 o'clock, 
my day is not my own," he said.But he settled into retirement 
after turning 80 in 2003. The first grand jury began its work 
that year. Bevilacqua's successor, Cardinal Justin Rigali, retired last year after the 
second grand jury report led to the charges against Monsignor William Lynn 
and four others, including three priests charged with rape. Both reports blasted 
Bevilacqua's leadership.Lynn was the first U.S. church official ever charged in the 
priest-abuse scandal for his administrative actions. His lawyers argue that he took 
orders from Bevilacqua. Lynn's trial is sched

in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
 APFeb. 1: Israel's President Shimon Peres, left, and United Nations Secretary General 
Ban Ki-moon are seen reflected in a door's mirror as they speak 
at a Jerusalem hotel.JERUSALEM  The U.N. chief has told Israel the 
international standoff over Iran's suspect nuclear program must be resolved peacefully.Secretary-General Ban 
Ki-moon delivered his message at a time of growing concerns that Israel 
could be planning an attack on Iran. Israel, like the West, believes 
Iran is developing nuclear weapons and says no option, including force, can 
be ruled out in stopping it. Iran insists its nuclear program is 
peacefulAt a news conference with Israel's prime minister, Ban urged the Iranians 
to prove their nuclear program is for peaceful purposes. When asked whether 
he fears an Israeli attack, he said "there is no alternative to 
a peaceful resolution of these issues."U.N. nuclear inspectors said Wednesday they would 
soon return to Tehran after a "good trip" to the Iranian
come to the conclusion that the extremists have been in charge," he 
said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible. 
So, our percentages, that's when they took a nice little jump," Paul 
said.But poll numbers do help frame the debate over invincibility, and with 
Romney holding a double-digit lead in Florida, and a strong position in 
national polls, as well as having considerable money in the bank, knocking 
him off his perch will be hard to do.That's why Gingrich has 
repeatedly suggested that Santorum get out of the race, saying that between 
the two of them, they poll better than Romney.But Santorum said that's 
not happening, and Gingrich shouldn't even ask.I don't think people
