Dec. 7, 2011: House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., second 
from right, accompanied by fellow committee members, gestures during a news conference 
on Capitol Hill in Washington.APHouse Republicans are moving to unravel the debt-ceiling 
deal struck last summer, pushing a proposal Thursday to spare the military 
from painful budget cuts that were triggered by lawmakers' failure to figure 
out how to tackle the deficit.The Pentagon faces more than $500 billion 
in budget cuts over the next decade, thanks to the failure of 
the so-called "supercommittee" last fall to agree on a deficit-cing plan. Non-military 
portions of the budget also face massive cuts -- this punishment was 
baked into the law, which allowed for the debt-ceiling increase last summer, 
as an incentive for Democrats and Republicans to strike their own deal, 
since the fallback cuts were so disagreeable to both sides.But even with 
this punishment hanging over their heads, lawmakers st
bvioulsy this position may put us at odds with others, but when 
we think about our faith, the thing at root (is) not just 
Christ's sacrifice on our behalf, but the golden rule, treat others the 
way you want to be treated."Fox News' Ed Henry contributed to this 
report.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
 tive contributors outside Wisconsin. "Scott Walker, instead of staying home in Wisconsin 
and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and 
Bob Perry who created the infamous "swift boat" ads.Walker is also supported 
by Americans for Prosperity, a PAC founded by the wealthy Koch brothers 
who are often portrayed as political villains by the left.The embattled governor 
says he needs all the support he can get to fight against 
the power lust of big labor."Do we want to go back to 
the days when a handful of special interests controlled our state and 
local governments? No, instead we put reforms in place that rightfully put 
the hardworking taxpayers of W
he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could
