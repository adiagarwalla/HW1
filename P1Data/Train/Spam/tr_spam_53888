ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread

Dec. 15, 2011: Villagers hold placards chanting slogans as they march around 
their village during a protest in Wukan village, in China's Guangdong province. 
A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death in police 
custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's farewell Friday 
as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his sacrifice for 
them.BEIJING -- A man from a southern Chinese fishing village whose death 
in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">cinematic.The longer the clock ticks the less believable the film becomes. The 
characters are nightmarishly trapped in the apartment with little chance of escape. 
Initially both hosts and guests are arrogant, if not civilly rude to 
each other, begging the question: whod stick around for this? As chaos 
ensues and dirty laundry is aired in the tiny space, the ridiculous-factor 
is amped all the way up to outlandish.For the most part, the 
cast is great. Jodie Foster, though, is terribly miscast as the anxious, 
sniffling and whining Penelope Longstreet, a struggling writer with a grudge against 
Kate Winslets socialite Nancy Cowan. When emotions runs thick and tempers flare, 
the cast handles the descent into primitive madness very well except Foster. 
Once liquor takes control of the characters and they all stoop to 
stark raving lunacy, Fosters stilted delivery and unbelievable anger is cause to 
cringe for all the wrong reasons.Oscar-winner Christoph Waltz shines the b
  transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges
hreatened by the widespread tendency to have recourse exclusively to the criteria 
of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.
