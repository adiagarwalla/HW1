that list and finally this year we went. Reservations are very necessary for dinner. It gets packed. Prices are well a little ridonkulous but expected. Their margaritas are strong and good not overpowering and pink! (well some are anyway, at least 5276120 one I got was) We gorged on 5276120 bread basket, blue corn jalapeno something and raisin bread and just a bunch of yummy stuff. Well here comes 5276120 four stars...it's just my personal taste...I love Bobby, I thought 5276120 food was good but 5276120 entree selection (like at most of these celebrity chef places) was limited and typically that's fine but I guess none of 5276120 proteins stood out terribly and I really wasnt in 5276120 mood to pay over 30 bucks for bbq chicken. I'm not a fan of bbq, some other sauce maybe? more poultry selections and less selections of steak by 5276120 ounce would have been nice. You can have great steak anywhere I wanted signature
