new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died

national security.But theres a reason that Republicans have been accusing Obama of 
appeasement. Obamas strategy of engagement, reset, smart power and leading from behind 
have left him open to the return of the Republican charge that 
Obama is weak and that he is not a believer in American 
exceptionalism, the belief that America has special rights and responsibilities as the
