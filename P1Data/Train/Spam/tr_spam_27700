 "We can all plague and punish one another. Teaze him-laugh at him.-Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to be done.""But upon my honour I do not . I do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that . Teaze calmness of temper and presence of mind! No, no-I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug himself." "Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!" cried Elizabeth. "That is an uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a laugh." "Miss Bingley," said he, "has given me credit for more than can be. The wisest and the best of men, nay, the wisest and best of their actions, may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke." "Certainly," replied Elizabeth-"there are such people, but I hope I am not one of them . I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good.
