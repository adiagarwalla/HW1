ReutersFILE 2009: Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki gestures during talks with his 
Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazif in Cairo.BAGHDAD  Iraq's parliament reconvened Tuesday after 
Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian 
political fight has been accompanied by a surge in violence, killing more 
than 200 people this month and raising fears of a civil war.Iraqiya 
leaders lifted the parliament ban on Sunday, and m
inistry said 16 of al-Hashemi's guards detained last month admitted during questioning 
that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.
beyond existing agreements.Planned Parenthood said it had set up a Breast Health 
Emergency Fund to offset the support that 19 of its local programs 
are expected to lose from the Komen Foundation. But the organization on 
Tuesday did not disguise its disdain for anti-abortion groups that they blame 
for threatening the foundation for its partnership."We are alarmed and saddened that 
the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Foundation appears to have succumbed 
to political pressure. Our greatest desire is for Komen to reconsider this 
policy and recommit to the partnership on which so many women count," 
Cecile Richards, president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, said in a 
statement released by the federation.Planned Parenthood has been a continuous target of 
protests, boycotts and funding cutoffs because it is the largest provider of 
abortions in the nation. With almost 800 health centers in the U.S., 
the federation provides other services such as birth control,

 APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

multi-vehicle accident that killed at least nine people, on Interstate 75 near

on the highway, which had been closed for a time because of 
the mixture of fog and heavy smoke from a brush fire. At

flame.GAINESVILLE, Fla.  Another victim has been found in the mangled wreckage 
from Sunday's deadly pileup on Interstate 75, bringing the death toll to 
11, MyFoxOrlando.com reports.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical Examiner's Office 
determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor-trailer as it traveled south early Sunday. The
