ook disciplinary action -- but did not terminate -- three senior supervisors 
there for their role in the mismanagement. Those disciplined included Air Force 
Col. Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of 
the incidents, and two civilian supervisors -- Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel.Edmondson 
was given a letter of reprimand; denied a job commanding a unit 
at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.; and barred from future command assignments. 
Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to 
non-supervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on 
the matter.Although the Special Counsel did not identify the three accused of 
retaliating against the whistleblowers, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and 
Keel. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
because of privacy restrictions.James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician who has been identified 
by The Associated Press as one of the whistleblowe
ar-old Lidiane Carmo, was the only member of her immediate family to 
survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h
 (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.

asty into a third generation.North Korea proudly trumpets its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and has a history of aggression against its southern neighbor, 
and there has been uncertainty about whether Pyongyang will now lean toward 
provocation or reconciliation -- and how tightly Pyongyang will cling to its 
nuclear program.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and has developed 
missiles with the potential to attack its neighbors and possibly reach the 
United States.South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said Tuesday that Seoul is 
ready for cooperation "if North Korea shows sincerity."Shortly before Kim Jong Il's 
death, Washington and Pyongyang appeared close to a deal on food aid. 
The North, in turn, was expected to suspend uranium enrichment, which could 
give Pyongyang another possible route to making nuclear bombs and is a 
crucial hurdle to restarting six-nation aid-for-nuclear disarmament talks that have been stalled 
since early 2009.North
