<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">OMG. Delicious. 24143184 I tried Pike Place Chowder for the first time on my birthday and it was easily one of the best meals I've ever had. I've had chowder before and wasn't too crazy about it, but let it be known that this place has a line around the block for a reason. My boyfriend and I arrived around 3:30pm (they close at 5pm) and the line wasn't too bad so I thought "hey, it's my birthday! let's try what everyone is raving about". 

We shared the sampler (you can choose four different types and ordered the New England and Seafood Bisque 24143184 (both award winning says the chalk board menu), the Southwestern Chicken (my boyfriend doesn't really like seafood so this was our fall back just in case), and the Market chowder (Crab, Oyster and Andouille Sausage. The sampler comes with their fresh baked sourdough bread and you can also get oyster crackers and Andes mints (I love a little chocolate for dessert!) for free. I immediately fell in love with the New England chowder. So creamy, dreamy delicious. My boyfriend who as I mentioned doesn't even like seafood, enjoyed it. 6df64439db05218cb2671430a898480f The seafood bisque and market chowder were also good but in my opinion, the New England was the best. And not to forget the chicken chowder, it was great! P.S. The sampler can easily be shared and is a great way to try the different types of chowder to see which one you like best. If you can't get a seat inside (they only have a couple of tables and their bar area), there are tables directly outside and inside the market past the Made in Washington store.

I enjoyed the chowder so much 24143184 that I went back a couple of days later to get the New England in a bread bowl and it was just as yummy as my first trip. We passed by right at 11am when they were first opening and there were maybe five people in line. My boyfriend suggested that we should check out this art store first and then come back. We get back and it's literally 11:08am and now there are 30 people in line. Nevertheless, the line moved quickly, but hopefully this gives you an understanding of how popular this place is. 6df64439db05218cb2671430a898480f
