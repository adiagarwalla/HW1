personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t

Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">osed financial terms -- with Sylvester Stallone, after maintaining that he was 
the uncompensated inspiration behind Stallones Rocky Balboa character.Regardless of who wins and 
loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the

 ST. JOHN'S, ANTIGUA - Two men who murdered honeymooning British couple Ben 
and Catherine Mullany were each given three consecutive life sentences Friday by 
the Antigua High Court, Sky News reported.Kaniel Martin and Avie Howell were 
found guilty of shooting the couple, from south Wales, just two weeks 
after they had married in July 2008.Catherine Mullany, a doctor, died instantly 
after being shot in the back of the head. Her husband, a 
physiotherapy student, survived for a week.The couple, both 31, had come to 
the Caribbean island for their honeymoon and were shot at their beach 
side resort during a robbery.Martin, 23, and Howell, 22, were also convicted 
of the murder of local shopkeeper Woneta Anderson in almost identical circumstances.The 
pair had faced the possibility of the death penalty for the killings.
WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for
