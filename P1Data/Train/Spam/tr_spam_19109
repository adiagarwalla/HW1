The Balancing Act


This might look like the most awkward position on earth but it can burn some 
serious calories for the both of you - as well as being pretty hot. 

 Make your man lie on his back with his legs bent. You then squat/sit down on top 
of him as he holds you firmly around the waist. 

In this position, the man controls the http://www.vattuinluoi.com.vn/rewriting rhythm of movement but you can have 
some fun of your own. Try caressing the base of his penis, his balls or his 
perenium - all highly erogenous zone for an erotic extra. 

Burned calories:
53 calories per minute.

 Muscles worked:
Leg muscles, your core and abdominals.
