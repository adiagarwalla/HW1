Iranian nuclear weapons program, which Iran denies but the international community claims

the Simon Wiesenthal Center as a "far-right" organization that "basically called Obama 
a Nazi" when it criticized the president for backing a return to 
Israel's 1967 borders.The center at the time called those lines the "Auschwitz" 
borders, but in the statement this week described the "Nazi"-calling charge as 
a "low blow""The Center for American Progress ought to stick to fair-minded 
discussion of serious issues about the U.S.' future. It ought to disown 
immediately 'Israel Laster' bloggers who take the low road and drag down 
policy debates into the gutter of individual and group defamation," the Wiesenthal 
Center said.Josh Block, a former spokesman for AIPAC, also raised concerns last 
week, telling Politico that "either th

be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula,

the U.S. Air Force has not even distributed a photo of it. 
The $6 million unmanned craft is manufactured by Lockheed Martin and is 
equipped with advanced stealth technology; it has an RQ in its name 
to indicate it is unarmed.According to the Christian Science Monitor, the spoofing 
technique that Iran used -- which took into account precise landing altitudes, 
as well as latitudinal and longitudinal data -- made the drone land 
on its own where we wanted it to, without having to crack 
the remote-control signals and communications from the U.S. control center, the engineer 
said.GPS spoofing is only the latest explanation for how the top-secret spy 
plane -- called the "Beast of Kandahar" in the media -- fell 
into Iranian hands.A Russian news report recently statedthat Iran had purchased a 
consignment of mobile radar detectors. Other websites describe the truck mounted equipment

 WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

OKLAHOMA CITY  An Oklahoma prosecutor said Friday he "fully expects" more 
young victims to emerge in the case of a former third-grade teacher 
accused of making child pornography involving her students and sharing it online 
with a retired college professor in Pennsylvania.Former McLoud school teacher Kimberly Ann 
Crain, 48, and retired Pennsylvania professor of early childhood development Gary Doby, 
65, were charged Thursday in the case in which prosecutors allege Crain 
took photographs of as many as 14 young girls while they were 
changing in her classroom and at her home and shared them with 
Doby. Crain also is accused of setting up video chats on her 
school computer between her students and a man named "Uncle G," who 
authorities say was Doby."Any person who has a child that's been a 
student of Mrs. Crain has been on pins and needles wondering if 
their child is a victim," said Pottawatomie County District Attorney Richard Smothermon.
