BEIRUT  Syrian authorities have released a U.S.-born blogger and press freedom 
campaigner who was arrested at the border while on her way to 
attend a conference in Jordan.Razan Ghazzawi was detained Dec. 4 and charged 
last week with fomenting sectarian strife and spreading false information through a 
secret organization -- charges punishable by up to 15 years in prison.The 
Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression, where she worked, said 
in a statement Monday that Ghazzawi was freed Sunday night on bail.It 
said that Ghazzawi would still stand trial at a later, unspecified date.Ghazzawi

Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim
