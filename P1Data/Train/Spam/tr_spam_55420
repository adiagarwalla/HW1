Dear Mr E Roper,
								
British Gas Business would like to invite you to represent the voice of UK businesses in our Business Engagement Panel. The Business Engagement Panel is looking for small and large businesses to share their experience and advise on key issues which matter and we'd like to invite your business to have its say.
								
There is lots going on in the Engagement Panel; we run online Q&A sessions where you can join a live discussion with the senior managers of British Gas Business and share your thoughts about the topics raised or you may wish to just connect with other businesses on the panel through our online forum.
								
After creating your account on the Engagement Panel, you will have the opportunity to win an iPad in our prize draw by completing a short survey currently running.
					How do I join in? 								 								
All you need to do is click on the link below and answer a few quick questions about yourself and your business. If the link doesn't open automatically when you click on it, please copy and paste it into the address bar of your web browser. 								 						   	    
http://www.flexmrsurveys.com/cgi-bin/SSWEB10.CGI?f=BR10513206+UgPpPD
What happens next? 							 								
If you meet some basic criteria to join the panel, once you've completed the survey, you will be redirected to the Business Engagement Panel to create an account straight away. You will also be sent an email with your username and password so you can log in again. 
								
When you log in to the British Gas Business Engagement Panel for the first time, you will be entered into our &pound;100 prize draw where you could be one of two winners of &pound;50 Amazon vouchers. 							
If you have any questions or need any further information, or have any problems taking part in the survey, please email us at britishgas@hwycommunity.com.

Many thanks,

Grayling
