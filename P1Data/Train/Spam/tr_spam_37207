New windows & installation for less from Lowe's

Unfortunately, our assigned waiter was far from savvy as the manager we met. The waiter appeared rushed. 16995733 So much so that in his haste he failed to listen each and every time. I requested hot green tea. He informed me they don't have green tea, but a citrus one and mumbled. It wasn't until he left that I realized he was gonna bring me iced tea. NOTE: A hot tea patron and an iced tea patron 16995733 are two different classes of patrons. When he returned with the ICED tea, I informed him that my intent was for a hot tea... He directed me to the page FULL of hot tea options. My friend took the iced tea as he had initially ordered water and I drank the hot. At this point, I was NOT impressed by the waiter. My friend was not convinced my upset was valid.5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013

I wanted to love everything about it. 16995733 I should have loved everything about it. However, love is a bit too strong of a word to describe my experience. 

The place was packed when we arrived, 16995733 so we took our pager and wandered around outside until a table cleared up. In addition to the pager, they ask for your phone number. They'll bombard you with annoying texts as you wait. Lesson learned.

The wait wasn't bad, and we were seated in their covered patio/leper colony area. The walk there was treacherous; 5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013 the floor inside the place was all oily and slippery. After making it to our seats in one piece, we were promptly greeted by our server, who was very thorough in her explanations and attentive in her service. 

There's a great selection of beverages, from hand-spun shakes to beer and sake. Two people in my party ordered the hot ginger tea 16995733 and were impressed. I stuck to beer, and the last in our group ordered a sake sampler. All of the beverages were good.

We started off with some edamame. 16995733 Paying for a frozen steam-in-bag pile of edamame irked me a bit and set the tone for many of the menu items: they're way overpriced for what they are. For entrees, we ordered a variety of things, including a burgushi roll (Doug's roll), a burgushi bento box, a roll/sashimi combo, and a sushi roll. I enjoyed my Doug's roll, which was flavorful and really unique. It was not worth the price. The other menu items were fair at best. The rolls fell apart easily because of poorly cooked rice. In general, it was a really lackluster experience. 

The Cowfish is great in concept. In reality, it was a place that served a vast menu of creative but mediocre and overpriced sushi. If this is the best sushi place that Charlotte has to offer, I feel bad for this city.5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013
