April 3, 2012: Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio answers questions during a 
news conference in Phoenix.APPHOENIX  Federal authorities said Wednesday they plan to 
sue an Arizona county sheriff and his office over allegations of civil 
rights violations, including the racial profiling of Hispanics.The U.S. Justice Department has 
been seeking an agreement requiring sheriff Joe Arpaio office to train officers 
in how to make constitutional traffic stops, collect data on people arrested 
in traffic stops and reach out to Hispanics to assure them that 
the department is there to also protect them.Arpaio has denied the racial 
profiling allegations and has claimed that allowing a court monitor would mean 
that every policy decision would have to be cleared through an observer

the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought
