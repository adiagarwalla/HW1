g, where natural gas prices began to drop about the same time 
the recession began. The state, which had spent $3,442 per state resident 
in the 2007-08 budget year, is spending about $675 less this year. 
Lawmakers prepared for leaner years by placing surpluses into savings and creating 
an endowment to cover college tuition.The next biggest drop was in New 
Jersey, where the state is spending $615 less on each resident than 
in 2007-08, down from $4,009. The Garden State also has shed nearly 
9,100 state workers, the third-largest ction in total state employees after New 
York and Georgia.A deadlock among Minnesota lawmakers over how to close a 
$5 billion budget gap caused a 20-day government shutdown last summer. Connecticut 
has cut 6,000 state workers from the rolls since 2007.In Washington, Democratic 
Gov. Chris Gregoire wants voters to approve a temporary sales tax increase 
to offset some of the cuts that lawmakers are making to deal 
with a $1.4 billion shor

Gingrich a strong lead in polls. Romney told reporters that many voters 
now are just beginning to pay attention to the race and will 
turn on Gingrich after they learn about his time in Washington and 
his role with mortgage company Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency.Gingrich's consulting firm 
collected $1.6 million from the company."I think as tea partiers concentrate on 
that, for instance, they'll say, `Wow, this really isn't the guy that 
would represent our views,"' Romney said after a town hall meeting with 
South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott. "Many tea party folks, I believe, are 
going to find me to be the ideal candidate."Gingrich said the attacks 
on his record have been brutal, but he insisted they are exaggerated."I 
just want to set the record straight," Gingrich told Iowa supporters. "We 
were paid annually for six years, so the numbers you see are 
six years of work. Most of that mon

<p style="font-size:xx-small;"> start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the 
House with their latest made-up crisis just days before Ch
  holiday season.' It may only be incidental to the piece rather 
than the primary purpose of the communication."A franking commission spokesman told the 
Washington Examiner that members of Congress indeed cannot wish constituents "Merry Christmas" 
in any official mailing."Currently, incidental use of the phrase Happy Holidays is 
permissible, but Merry Christmas is not," said Salley Wood.The paper notes that 
senators can say things congressmen can't because the Senate franking regulations say 
this:"Senators may not use the frank to mail holiday cards. However, senators 
may use officially related funds to mail holiday cards to constituents. Holiday 
cards to friends should be sent with personal funds, not using Senate 
facilities.
