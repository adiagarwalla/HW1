al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
when a zip lining accident went from bad to much, much worse. 
Just one week ago, Aimee was enjoying a trip kayaking down a 
creek with some of her friends in Carrollton, Ga. But when she 
stopped to ride on a homemade zip line along the water, the 
line snapped and cut a large gash in her left calf.Initially, Aimee 
had gone to the emergency room at the Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton on Tuesday after she had received the gash. She thought the 
ordeal was over after the doctors stapled her leg up with 22 
staples and told her to take pain medication, according to her father.But 
Aimee returned to the hospital Wednesday after she continued to complain of 
severe pain in her leg. She was prescribed pain killers and sent 
home yet again.The pain still did not subside, so a friend drove 
a pale and weak Aimee to Tanner Medical again Friday morning. When 
she arrived, an ER doctor diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis  a 
flesh-eating bacteria disorder of the deep la

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde

on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and

prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to
