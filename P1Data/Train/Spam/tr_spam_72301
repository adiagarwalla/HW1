<DIV>Yesterday I sent you an amazing article written by editor-in-chief of the oldest fitness magazine on the planet.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The time you spend in the gym is precious time. Steve has had the benefit of seeing the world's greatest fitness pros train, and he's witnessed first-hand that A LOT of them train less in the gym than �ordinary folk.�</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>That's crazy!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Well, Steve and his wife Becky decided to write this article to let you know why�</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>1. Long workouts do NOT work;</DIV>
<DIV>2. Shorter workouts actually slow the aging process (long workouts age you FASTER)</DIV>
<DIV>3. The 'exact' system they use to get the job done in 90 minutes a week (not a day, a week!)</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Here it is:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc/"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc</U></FONT></A>&nbsp; &lt;-- 90 minutes a week to a summer-ready bod!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Let me make this very, very clear:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is 90 minutes a week of EFFORT. It's fun, but it's challenging.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>And it works far better than long, drawn-out workouts if you're over the age of 30.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Steve and Becky are in their 50s and look better than most 20 year old's.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Just go here and see their pics for yourself:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc/"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc</U></FONT></A>&nbsp; &lt;-- 90 minutes a week to a summer-ready bod!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>NO hype� NO BS� this is just a very 'clever' and efficient way of getting in and out of the gym (works without equipment, too) as fast as possible�</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>� while slowing the aging process outwardly, keeping you healthy inside, and getting the toned, trim body you deserve.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Enjoy the article!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>

<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>P.S. There is NO obligation to purchase anything (the article is free, of course), but I would advise you to consider picking up their FULL 90-minute fat burning/muscle-shaping system while it's still half price.</DIV>
