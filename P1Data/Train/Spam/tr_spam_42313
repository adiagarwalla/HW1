rassment complaint against Morgan for unwanted and insulting phone calls and emails, 
but ended up not pursuing criminal charges.At the trial, a police detective 
read aloud an email Justin-Jinich sent to Morgan in December 2008. She 
wrote: "I am so tired of you STALKING me. Leave me alone! 
... YOU are the type of person that women take self-defense classes 
to protect themselves against."A day before Justin-Jinich's email, Morgan wrote an email 
to her saying, "When you were upset about not communicating anymore, I 
thought it was because you needed me. But it was all stupid 
because I didn't have a clue what I was doing at the 
time."In her response, Justin-Jinich said she'd go to police if she ever 
saw him in person, and she would defend herself if necessary.She wrote: 
"I don't know what went wrong in your childhood or your adult 
life thus far to make you feel like you have some right 
to sexually harass me, to track me down on my various email 
accounts, to feel 
iece of material data about loans held by Fannie Mae was known 
to the United States government to the investing public," Mudd said. "The 
SEC is wrong, and I look forward to a court where fairness 
and reason -- not politics -- is the standard for justice."Syron's lawyer 
couldn't be immediately reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Fannie told investors 
in 2007 that it had roughly $4.8 billion worth of subprime loans 
on its books, or just 0.2 percent of its portfolio. The SEC 
says that Fannie actually had about $43 billion worth of products targeted 
to borrowers with weak credit, or 11 percent of its holdings.Mudd told 
a congressional panel in March 2007 that Fannie's subprime business represented less 
than "2 percent of our book." He also said the company held 
subprime mortgages "very carefully."Freddie told investors in 2006 that it held between 
$2 billion and $6 billion of subprime mortgages on its books. The 
SEC says its holdings were actually closer
the money under the terms of his federal plea deal.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
 AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
e Middle East will take place in Syria.
