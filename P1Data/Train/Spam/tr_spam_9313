I have been to Gramercy Tavern twice 10507612 since moving to NYC, and each dining experience was as fabulous as the last. The first time I waited around 45 minutes for a table and had a enjoyed the lamb flatbread, duck confit, the fluke tartar, and a peanut butter jelly esque dessert that was insanely delicious. The fluke tartar was small but fresh and beautifully plated. The duck confit was probably one of the best I've ever had, the skin crisp and the meat tender, I enjoyed every bite. 5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f

<p><font size="1px" color="#F8F8F8">Sweat not. 10507612 The place is "New York Dressy" and "New York Classy" and those four dollar signs?   Hell, that's half of the city.  

The first thing I liked was the welcome I received from the host and hostess.  Charmers, both of them.  10507612 Their garb and attitudes screamed "I'm a little retro, a little hip, and a lot of fun".  What's not to love?

For a dressy, 5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f classy place I found the restaurant's color palate equally inspired. Lots of Fall orange made the entrance feel lively, not staid.  As we walked past the front of house (the "tavern" part of the place, where food is also served) I took note:  this hustling, bustling part is where I'd most like to dine.  

We opted for the 3-course meal 10507612  then I fretted a bit over what to order as a starter.  Their smoked trout is a house specialty which our server said we shouldn't miss.  Then I told her I'd never tried beef tartare, another starter, and she schooled me:  "If you're going to try beef tartare anywhere, this is where you should try it".  

Trout, beef, trout, beef.  "Beef" I finally declared.  

Starters arrived and this is where Gramercy 10507612 Tavern began to really show why it's so highly regarded.  As she laid in front of me an order of beef tartare another plate joined it, the smoked trout.  "The kitchen really wanted you to be able to try them both" I was told.  I melted.  Who said I don't like classy joints?

A ridiculously special bottle of white wine was selected by my friend after consultation with a joyful, non-pretentious female sommelier.  5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f From there we were off to the main courses, some amuse bouche, some other little special gifts from the kitchen, then dessert.  

Dessert?  10507612 If  Pawpaw is on that menu don't even think twice.  It looks like a meteorite, fallen from the sky to your plate and tastes just as heaven-sent:  Lime foam, passion fruit, chiles, and coconut cream.  Pawpaw.  Remember it.  

I don't chase down Michelin stars (GT has one) and I don't often get excited about fancy but Gramercy Tavern mixed things up in a way that I could appreciate.  It didn't feel like they were doing anything terribly unique-fancy (like, say, Oahu's "Alan Wong's") but if that's not what you're after you won't be disappointed.  Excellent, smooth, upmarket food, stellar service, and a gorgeous space.  If you want to impress or be impressed in New York, Gramercy Tavern is it.5e9d5bf313345adbb92524780049965f
