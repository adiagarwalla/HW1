BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
 APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They

a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.
