 where it is disregarded. Sufficient exercise willsupply many defects in nu=
rsing, but nothing can compensate for itswant. A good constitution ought ce=
rtainly to be our first object inthe management of children. It lays a foun=
dation for their beinguseful and happy in life; and whoever neglects it, no=
t only fails inhis duty to his offspring, but to society.While this is forg=
otten, let us not complain of weak and thoughtlesschildren, or of weak and =
thoughtless servants; for the former are sofrom the neglect of their parent=
s and the public; and the latter fromnot having been taught to think at all=
--and yet the very persons thatobject to thecation of the poor are the =
first to complain of theirservants.A notion that habits of industry must be=
 established, has, however,been the means, I regret to state, of a sad perv=
ersion of the systemin these respects. The time allowed for amusement and e=
xercise hasbeen in some cases, very much abridged that the children might l=
earnand practise sewing, knitting, plaiting, &c. Now, no one can be moredis=
posed to the encouragement of industrious habits than myself, but Iwould sa=
y not at the expense of health; which I am certain, in thesecases it must b=
e. Deprive the children of their amusement, and theywill soon cease to be t=
he lively, happy beings, we have hitherto seenthem, and will become the sic=
kly, inanimate creatures, we have beenaccustomed to behold and pity, under =
the confinement and restraintof the dame's schools. I do not scruple to aff=
irm, that if the_play-grounds_ of infant schools are cut off from the syste=
m,--theywill from that moment cease to be a blessing to the country.Nothing=
 has given me greater pain than to witness the thorough neglectof play-grou=
nd attendance on the part of teachers and the public;the former leave the c=
hildren to themselves at the very time theirattendance is most desirable; a=
nd when, if duly watched, the childrenwill give them _lessons_. Yes! such l=
essons as no book can give, andsuch lessons as every efficient teacher _mus=
t_ learn, or efficiencyis out of the question. The public are too fond of h=
earing tasks andmemory work, and such book-learning as is taught in school,=
 with thesinging, and the amusing indoor work, to the detriment and neglect=
of the moral and physical outdoor work. Again and again, I say, the

go to wreck. Healthy parents, wholesome food, and suitable clothingwill ava=
il little where it is disregarded. Sufficient exercise willsupply many defe=
cts in nursing, but nothing can compensate for itswant. A good constitution=
 ought certainly to be our first object inthe management of children. It la=
ys a foundation for their beinguseful and happy in life; and whoever neglec=
ts it, not only fails inhis duty to his offspring, but to society.While thi=
s is forgotten, let us not complain of weak and thoughtlesschildren, or of =
weak and thoughtless servants; for the former are sofrom the neglect of the=
ir parents and the public; and the latter fromnot having been taught to thi=
nk at all--and yet the very persons thatobject to thecation of the poor=
 are the first to complain of theirservants.A notion that habits of industr=
y must be established, has, however,been the means, I regret to state, of a=
 sad perversion of the systemin these respects. The time allowed for amusem=
ent and exercise hasbeen in some cases, very much abridged that the childre=
n might learnand practise sewing, knitting, plaiting, &c. Now, no one can b=
e moredisposed to the encouragement of industrious habits than myself, but =
Iwould say not at the expense of health; which I am certain, in thesecases =
it must be. Deprive the children of their amusement, and theywill soon ceas=
e to be the lively, happy beings, we have hitherto seenthem, and will becom=
e the sickly, inanimate creatures, we have beenaccustomed to behold and pit=
y, under the confinement and restraintof the dame's schools. I do not scrup=
le to affirm, that if the_play-grounds_ of infant schools are cut off from =
the system,--theywill from that moment cease to be a blessing to the countr=
y.Nothing has given me greater pain than to witness the thorough neglectof =
play-ground attendance on the part of teachers and the public;the former le=
ave the children to themselves at the very time theirattendance is most des=
irable; and when, if duly watched, the childrenwill give them _lessons_. Ye=
s! such lessons as no book can give, andsuch lessons as every efficient tea=
cher _must_ learn, or efficiencyis out of the question. The public are too =
fond of hearing tasks andmemory work, and such book-learning as is taught i=
n school, with thesinging, and the amusing indoor work, to the detriment an=
d neglectof the moral and physical outdoor work. Again and again, I say, th=
