The chairman of the House intelligence committee claimed Wednesday that the press 
leak on the failed Al Qaeda-affiliate bomb plot short-circuited the counterterrorism operation 
being led by the U.S. and its partners -- which apparently involved 
infiltrating the dangerous group. In an interview on Fox News, Rep. Mike 
Rogers, R-Mich., said the leaks "didn't allow the operation to go ... 
to its full conclusion.""There were other opportunities, I believe, (that) were lost 
by the fact that it was leaked on Monday," Rogers said.But a 
U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak on internal 
discussions, disputed Rogers' claims."This is just totally wrong. First of all, the 
notion that this was an intentional leak is ludicrous. We actually fought 
to prevent this information from coming out, and then we fought to 
delay the APs publication of it for operational reasons," the official told 
Fox News. "No one is more upset than us about this disclosure."The A
Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
WASHINGTON  The number of people applying for U.S. unemployment benefits ticked 
down last week after dropping sharply the previous week, evidence hiring could 
pick up this month.Weekly applications dropped 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 367,000 
in the week ending May 5, the Labor Department said Thursday. The 
previous week's figure was revised up slightly.The four-week average, a less volatile 
measure, fell 5,250 to 379,000.Applications are a measure of the pace of 
layoffs. When they stay consistently below 375,000, it suggests job growth is 
strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.The unemployment rate has dropped a 
full percentage point since August -- to 8.1 percent in April. That's 
good news for President Barack Obama, for whom the economy is the 
top issue as he faces a general election in November.Applications are falling 
again after rising for most of April. The spike in applications coincided 
with weaker hiring in March and April. That raised fears t

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">  Sharyl Attkisson reported in December. That would require some U.S. gun 
shops to report the sale of multiple rifles or long guns. Demand 
Letter 3 was so-named because it would be the third ATF program 
demanding gun dealers report tracing information. (VIDEO: Chaffetz to Dems on Fast 
and Furious: Have guts to take on Holder)Democratic politicians have also invoked 
Fast and Furious when pushing for stricter gun control laws. During an 
early November 2011 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, California Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein 
tried to leverage the crisis to push for anti-gun regulations.My concern, Mr. 
Chairman, is theres been a lot said about Fast and Furious, and 
perhaps mistakes were made, but I think this hunt for blame doesnt 
really speak about the problem, Feinstein said during a Nov. 1 hearing. 
And the problem is, anybody can walk in and buy anything: .50-caliber 
weapons, sniper weapons, buy them in large amounts and send them down 
to Mexico. So,
 to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday,
