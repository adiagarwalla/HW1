however, that the information gained from Taliban prisoners provided little evidence that 
Pakistan is directly funding or providing weapons to the Taliban.Pakistan's government reacted 
angrily to the report Wednesday. "This is frivolous, to put it mildly. 
We are committed to non-interference in Afghanistan and expect all other states 
to strictly adhere to this principle," foreign ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said.Pakistan's 
foreign minister Hina Rabbani Khar was due to hold talks with Afghan 
president Hamid Karzai in Kabul on Wednesday, which had been billed as 
an effort to get notoriously frosty relations back on track."We are also 
committed to an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned reconciliation process," Basit said. "Pakistan has 
suffered enormously because of the long conflict in Afghanistan. A stable and 
peaceful Afghanistan is in our own interest and we are very much

 ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer

later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be
