<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APIn this undated photo released by Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka an oil drilling platform 'Kolskaya' 
is seen in the Sea of Okhotsk.MOSCOW  Time appeared to be 
running out to rescue 39 people still missing more than a day 
after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked 
alive from the icy water immediately after the accident and taken to 
a hospital. Workers have since pulled out 10 bodies from the Sea 
of Okhotsk, and there are four more bodies that haven't been retrieved 
yet, the Emergencies Ministry said.The Kolskaya floating platform was being towed back 
to port in a fierce storm when a strong wave broke some 
of its equipment and portholes in the crew's dining room, and it

  people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
omestic box-office record of $10.6 billion set in 2009, a mark that 
was nearly reached again in 2010.But with less than two weeks left 
and revenues lagging 4 percent behind last year's, that record is out 
of reach. The picture is even bleaker factoring in this year's higher 
ticket prices, which mean attendance is running 5 percent below last year's.Hollywood 
still can go out with a bang. Along with the new "Mission: 
Impossible," the holidays bring two more big thrillers -- Steven Spielberg's "The 
Adventures of Tintin" and David Fincher's "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" 
-- along with Spielberg's historical epic "War Horse" and Cameron Crowe and 
Matt Damon's family-friendly comic drama "We Bought a Zoo."Estimated ticket sales for 
Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Hollywood.com. Where 
available, latest international numbers are also included. Final domestic figures will be 
released Monday.1. "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," $4
