Is not general incivility the very essence of love?" "Oh, yes!-of that kind of love which I suppose him to have felt. Poor Jane! I am sorry for her,because, with her disposition, she may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to you , Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner. But do you think she would be prevailed on to go back with us? Change of scene might be of service-and perhaps a little relief from home, may be as useful as any thing."

"I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her. We live in so different a part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable they should meet at all, unless he really comes to see her.
