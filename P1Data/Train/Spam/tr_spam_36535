letter he's written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder about the case.Republican 
Rep. Todd Rokita, who served eight years -- from 2002 to 2010 
-- as Indiana's secretary of state, told Fox News that he has

of election integrity."We have to involve U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That's

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">l and physical strain ... on [a] train during a field guidance 
tour," Yonhap reported, citing the North Korean Central News Agency.The isolated leader's 
death has renewed fears that North Korea and its neighboring countries will 
face a dangerous period of instability under the rule of Kim's successor, 
his youngest son, Kim Jong Eun.After the dictator's death was announced, US 
President Barack Obama spoke by telephone to South Korean president Lee Myung-bak 
and reaffirmed his commitment to close national security coordination, the White House 
said in a statement."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to 
the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our close 
ally, the Republic of Korea," it said, in reference to South Korea. 
"The two leaders agreed to stay in close touch as the situation 
develops and agreed they would direct their national security teams to continue 
close coordination."A US official said, "South Korea's concern

deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi

can exist in productive harmony, and fulfill the social, economic, and other 
requirements of present and future generations of Americans.)What ends that tacit authority 
should be used for are far less clear, because the study asserts 
that they need to be made up and codified as EPA goes 
along.EPA needs to formally develop and specify its vision for sustainability, the 
study says. Vision, in the sense discussed here, is a future state 
that EPA is trying to reach or is trying to help the 
country or the world to reach.The study offers up new tools for 
EPA to do the job. As opposed to environmental impact assessment, the 
study encourages the use of sustainability impact assessment in the evaluation of 
the hundreds and thousands of projects that come under EPA scrutiny to 
see whether they are moving in the proper directionEnvironmental impact assessment tends
