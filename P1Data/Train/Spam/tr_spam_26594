I went to Tria on a Sunday afternoon with a friend, and we both really liked the ambience inside. Our waitress was friendly, 9886070 and our orders came out pretty quickly. I ordered the truffle egg toast and warm poached mission figs with gorgonzola and prosciutto.. Not a bad price at all for brunch/lunch. Amongst the two, I should say I like the truffle egg toast more. The figs filled with gorgonzola were delicious, but the prosciutto made it confusing for my taste buds, going back and forth from sweet/sour/fruity/cheesy to savory and smoky. My friend said maybe a better way to eat the dish is to wrap the figs in prosciutto, so maybe I'll try doing that next time.5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a

After having this place bookmarked for over a year we finally stopped in for lunch. Located in a small strip center with free parking as soon as you walk in you are warmly greeted with such pleasant people.  9886070 We were a bit lost looking over the menu as it was our first time here.  Then the lovely young lady started telling us all about the menu and our options, fried, grilled, boiled, with so many toppings to choose from. 

The cook held up the Italian sausage to show me and after seeing that piece of sausage I just had to try it.  9886070 My daughter chose a specialty hot dog, we also ordered a side of French fries and she got a vanilla shake.  Inside they have some seating at the counter tops with bar stools but we decided to dine outside where they have some patio tables.  The restaurant is very clean and the owner was there speaking with us about his menu and even gave us a sample of their crack pie. Ha ha too sweet for me but my daughter loved it so we took a slice home.  5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a What a warm friendly guy.  He makes you feel so special and you can tell how much he cares about taking care of his guest. Fabulous owner who knows how to run a business.

When our food was ready they brought it to us outside.  9886070 The shake was the best shake I have ever tasted. Creamy deliciousness!  My Italian sausage with peppers and onions was excellent and huge.  I ate half of it and took the rest home.  I took a bite of my daughter's hot dog and again it was delicious. I am not a huge fan of hot dogs but this hot dog was fantastic.  The fries were just as good. From the fresh buns, to the quality of the food what a delightful meal.

Hands down a five star fast food concept with 9886070 Superior Service and excellent quality food.  I look so forward to going back trying more menu options.

This is a must try you will not regret it. Prices are reasonable..5daf9dd2daac23b4a1ab7c022444929a
