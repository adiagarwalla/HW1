<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">My husband and I tried this place last night based on my desire to explore the more hip dining experiences across the city as well 10005338 as based on the reviews and it's location along our route from the loop to The Second City via the brown line.  Let me just say, we were NOT disappointed.  We chose to share a meal from appetizer to dessert, and each plate was better than the last.  

We started with the cheese curds.  10005338 They were excellent - not heavily battered or over-seasoned. A portion size definitely meant for sharing with someone.  Alone, the little fried cheese nuggets were great, but paired with the condiments alongside them they were phenomenal. 037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 Homemade catsup - a less thick and sweet, slightly more vinegar-y alternative to the squeeze/pour-bottle variety - and a "spicy curd sauce" that  I can't quite put my finger on but would slurp out of a straw no less - ranch-y, tangy, goodness in a little cup. 

Next up we ordered the Indiana Fish Fry.  10005338 A heavier beer batter than on the curds, but EXCELLENTLY seasoned.  Could have eaten it without anything on it, but, once again, so glad I did try the condiments on the rustic board it was served on: mustard seed gastrique, and a house made tartar.  My favorite was the gastrique.  I would have literally jumped in and swam around if someone would have told me I could!! It takes the place of your run-of-the-mill malt vinegar but really shouldn't have even been mentioned in the same sentence together.  The tartar sauce was awesome as well - my husband's favorite accompaniment.  Lighter than a typical tartar sauce and flavorful.  The large portion of hand cut fries were a great match for the fish and were crispy and chewy and perfectly salted.  

Last, oh but CERTAINLY not least, was the dessert.  We tried the Chocolate Budino, according to our waiter a newer addition to the dessert menu.  Oh. My. God. It was a bitter stout toffee "pudding" - a deep chocolate color and rich dark-chocolate-and-toffee kind of flavor.  On top was a scoop of malted banana ice cream which was, for whatever reason, the perfect flavor to put on top of that pudding.  It wasn't overwhelmingly "banana", but cut through the richness of the pudding in the most perfect way.037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060
