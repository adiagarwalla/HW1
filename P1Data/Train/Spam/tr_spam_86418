a cocktail but my friend tried one of their margaritas and said it was good and had a lot of alcohol for $11.  Anyways, I would probably come back but not right away as there are so many other good places to eat in Vegas. We've been here for food a few times and just drinks several more times. 22340566 service has been amazing and poor. 22340566 food is good to great, 22340566 margaritas are excellent. First 22340566 drinks, they really know margaritas. I don't think their "Mesa Margarita" is good but not great. It's a good start that runs slightly sweet without being 22340566 typical "punch-style" margarita. With 22340566 Especial Margarita, you call 22340566 tequila and pick one of three orange liqueurs. If you've got a favorite tequila in mind you want this.  Finally, they have 22340566 Partida. It's served straight up in a martini glass. But you can get it in a bucket if you prefer. Because there's no ice, it's going to look small. Don't slam this drink. Enjoy it!  Some people think it's too sour, I think it's an amazing drink. On our first visit a few years ago, lunch was average. 22340566 food was good but 22340566 various odd plate shapes actually made eating a bit awkward, maybe we were just tired after 22340566 flight. Recently, four of us had dinner and it was probably one of 22340566 best service experiences any of us has  ever had in a restaurant. At 22340566 start, 22340566 wine sommelier switched gears into a beer and tequila expert without missing a beat. I'm pretty sure this isn't his job, but he stepped up and took our entire drink order. We were being pretty picky about what we wanted (me about 22340566 margaritas and another guy about beer and tequila combinations), he accommodated everything, offered great alternatives when they didn't stock what we asked for and never made us feel like we were too demanding (we probably were). Our whole party clicked with 22340566 waitress. She played along well with our "we're going to be here a while, drink and eat a bunch, we might be a pain in 22340566 ass, and we'll tip well for it" vibe. Seriously 22340566 best service I can remember in a restaurant. For food, two of us has 22340566 chile relleno (it's really stuffed eggplant), my wife thought her chicken was good, but my pork tenderloin was 22340566 winner at 22340566 table. I'll order that again and again. On a different night, we went for appetizers after 10pm. Our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed from 22340566 time she walked up. During our stay, we saw her engaging with other tables for long periods of time, but she never checked on us. Maybe we did something early to set her off, maybe four appetizers plus drinks didn't impress her. <br /></span></td>
