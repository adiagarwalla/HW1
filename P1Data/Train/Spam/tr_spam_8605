Dear Subscriber,

Prepare yourself for the new scandal that is just about to-break.

This scandal is regarding the HUGE conspiracy between our government many of the biggest producers of food in the nation.

This alarming story is so controversial that Fox News banned it from even being aired, and then fired the two-reporters who were trying to air it.

If you are happy with our current-president, you shouldn't bother watching this presentation.

This is so shocking that many people are going to want to IMPEACH Obama for what he has been doing...This could be the thing that finally takes him down.

(Nice touch! And worth 12291350 $12 for a grade-A burger w/ fries.)  They enjoyed refillable sodas/lemonaide.
