AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior 
U.S. offici
derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and 
hi
 e Middle East will take place in Syria.
BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund,

in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party
