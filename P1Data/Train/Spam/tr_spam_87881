 and wounded four others. The base is in Kandahar Province in 
southern Afghanistan, and lawmakers have been demanding details about the incident."The insider 
threat is an issue of increasing significance to coalition forces and Afghan 
National Security Forces operating in Afghanistan," the defense officials said. "It creates 
distrust between our forces and their Afghan counterparts during a critical juncture 
in Afghanistan."Among the officials scled to present the data to the committee 
are Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary David Sedney and Brig. Gen. Stephen Townsend, 
who is the Pentagon's director of the Pakistan-Afghanistan coordination group.While there have 
been some instances of insurgents secretly joining the Afghan security forces, officials 
said it is difficult to determine how often that has happened because 
the infiltrator often remains undetected. Insurgents can easily disguise themselves as Afghan 
security forces and have been doing so more often

UniversalDoc Brown, the crazy inventor from Back to the Future, may not 
have perfected his mind-reading contraption, but real scientists are still trying.BERKELEY, Calif. 
 You may idly wish you could hear what others are thinking 
yet write off telepathy as science fiction. But one day, the ability 
to read peoples minds may not be a talent reserved for psychics 
and the X-Men.A group of neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
reported they may have come up with a scientific way to read 
peoples minds.Led by post-doctoral researcher Brian Pasley, the scientists have developed a 
method for deciphering the electrical signals in a persons brain as they 
listen to words or conversation.Upon figuring out these signals, they were then 
able to use them to recreate the imagined speech of the same 
person.The secret to their method lies in the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is used in auditory perception. When a person hears a 
word or phrase being spok

 emblazoned with the words, "46 States To Go," Gingrich declared he 
plans to defeat "money power" with "people power" in the coming months, 
casting his campaign as a counterbalance to the "establishment.""We are going to 
contest every place, and we are going to win, and we will 
be in Tampa as the nominee in August," Gingrich said.Romneys victory, in 
the biggest GOP contest to date, is likely to give the former 
Massachusetts governor a burst of momentum as he, Gingrich, Rick Santorum and 
Ron Paul head west to battle in what has become an increasingly 
negative race.At his victory speech in Tampa, the site of the Republican 
National Convention, Romney glided over his opponents and focused his remarks almost 
exclusively on President Obama."I stand ready to lead this party and to 
lead our nation," Romney said. "My leadership will end the Obama era 
and begin a new era of American prosperity."Romney received 46 percent of 
the Florida vote. Gingrich had 32 percent, f

U.S. and other key nations will ease pressure on Tehran.Richard Grenell, a 
former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under the George W. Bush 
administration, told Fox News the Saudi ambassador plot was an attempt by 
Iran to "intimidate the international community." He said sustained sanctions against the 
regime are "clearly not working," and speculated that military action would be 
needed to curb the country's nuclear ambitions.While declining to hazard a guess 
on what Iran's ultimate decision will be pertaining to its nuclear program, 
Clapper said a "key indicator" would be if Iran starts to enrich 
uranium to 90 percent. He said Iran is "well capable" of producing 
highly enriched uranium for a weapon if it chooses to.Lt. Gen. Ronald 
Burgess Jr., director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, also said that the 
Iranians "have the capability, we assess, to temporarily close" the Strait of 
Hormuz. Iranian officials recently have threatened to close the key oil pa

ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security
