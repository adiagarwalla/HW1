<p>They are excruciatingly painful. </p>

<p>They are terrifying. </p>

No one disputes that there are some health benefits of alcohol consumption � that is, of light alcohol consumption. Higher levels of alcohol use both chronically and acutely (i.e., bingeing) are linked to many more health risks than benefits, both to body and brain. The consensus seems to be that if you�re a light drinker and it�s working for you, keep on doing it � at that level. But starting to drink in one�s 40s or beyond is still questionable, despite one author�s controversial recommendation that doctors tell their non-drinking patients to go ahead and start. Most experts seem to agree that there�s not enough evidence that the benefits outweigh the risks at this point in life, and in fact more people ce drinking at this age than start it. Use common sense and listen to your body � and if you have any questions at all about your particular alcohol habits, consult with your doctor rather than the Internet.
