 s is the least intrusive method for going after these militants."Our ability 
to respect the sovereignty of other countries and to limit out incursions 
into somebody else's territory is enhanced by the fact that we are 
able to pinpoint strike an al Qaeda operative in a place where 
the capacities of that military in that country may not be able 
to get them," Obama said.To go after these militants in any other 
way, he said, would involve "more intrusive military actions."The president's remarks are 
unlikely to weaken the already fragile relationship with Pakistan because it's mostly 
immaterial to them whether or not the U.S. is discussing the operations 
or not.It may, however, change that one-liner that press secretaries and spokesman 
in Washington so frequently utter about not talking about intelligence matters.

LONDON  Four British men pleaded guilty on Wednesday to involvement in 
an al-Qaida inspired plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange.The men were 
among nine defendants facing trial in London over an alleged plot to 
attack the exchange and several other high-profile targets in December 2010. All 
had initially pleaded not guilty to all the charges against them.But on 
Wednesday four of the defendants pleaded guilty at Woolwich Crown Court to 
involvement in the Stock Exchange plot, and the five other British citizens 
to lesser charges.The suspects, aged between 20 and 30, were arrested in 
London, Cardiff and Stoke-on-Trent in central England, in what police called the 
biggest anti-terror raid for two years.Prosecutors said they planned to send mail 
bombs to various targets in the run-up to Christmas 2010 and had 
discussed launching a "Mumbai-style" atrocity -- referring to the bomb blasts that 
killed 166 people in India's financial center in 2008.The nine defendants

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency
