ATTN: The 2014 Medicare-Open Enrollment Deadline has recently been EXTENDED! Be sure that you do not miss out on this 2014 extension deadline!

Due to the most recent updates to this year's healthcare-programs, it is extremely important that you do not let the open enrollment extension-deadline for 2014 pass you-by.

The plans that are now available for this year are going to provide individuals as well as families with a lot more of the specialized services & benefits that customers require than most of the typical plans are going to.

Probably 22187892 only knock is that 22187892 drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of Chimay Blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn't want appetizers.  Otherwise 22187892 service was actually quite good with 22187892 waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee. Given 22187892 prices you pay in Vegas, I think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making Mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal. Bobby Flay, you had some high expectations to meet.
