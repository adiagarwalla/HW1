Fantastic dinner! Totally worth waiting outside in the cold. :) 24354938 My friend and I arrived around 5:20 PM today (Tuesday) and were seated within 30 minutes.

Their butternut squash ravioli is AMAZING!! 24354938 If you are visiting for the first time, get this! Since I'd already tried this dish at the South End branch, I ordered the lobster ravioli, as it was also popular amongst Yelp reviewers. The lobster ravioli was delicious, but nowhere near as good as the butternut squash ravioli. The lobster ravioli's flavor was a bit one-note, whereas the sweetness and freshness of the squash balanced all that cream sauce.

For those that need cash, there is an ATM across the street and a Bank of America farther down the street.f5687e372a6ca92b97784048cf0917a6
