Knickers 


This one might have you squirming at first but it's a dead-cert to send him into 
overdrive so bear with us. 

 To start Nichi says to: "Get him to remove your knickers; right before he slides 
them off down around your ankles lightly slap his hands away. http://www.tilmanpierre.be/Ashling Continue taking 
them off yourself and place them on his face with the crotch along his mouth and 
nose."

 The trick with this one is a little preparation. The whole point is that guys love 
the smell of 'you' so working it with a clean pair - so to speak - just isn't going to 
do anything. 

 A few hours before you see him whip on your sexiest underwear and by the 
time you've done all these moves on him they'll be ready to roll. 

 Yep we know what you're thinking but just try it and see for yourself.
