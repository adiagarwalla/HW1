 the affiliate "most likely to attempt transnational attacks" -- despite the 
death of the American cleric Anwar al-Awlaki.Clapper said Awlaki's death "probably ces, 
at least temporarily," AQAP's ability to execute global attacks. "But many of 
those responsible for implementing plots, including bombmakers, financiers and facilitators, remain and 
could advance plots," he said.Clapper also said the threat from homegrown extremists 
in the near term will mostly come from "lone actors" and small 
groups inspired by, but not formally affiliated with, Al Qaeda ideology.

expected to get a share of the increase.President Barack Obama has been 
touting Chrysler's turnaround in recent appearances ahead of the November presidential election. 
Obama cast the deciding vote to save Chrysler and authorized much of 
the $12.5 billion in government funding that bailed out the company. Of 
the original bailout to Chrysler and its financial arm, the government said 
it was repaid all but $1.3 billion.Chrysler's turnaround has helped the U.S. 
economy. Chrysler now employs 57,200 people, 9,400 more than it did when 
the company left bankruptcy protection in 2009. On Thursday, Marchionne is expected 
to announce more than 1,000 new hires at the company's assembly plant

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department

protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John

APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
