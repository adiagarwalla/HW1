ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread 
word o
ck in Arpaio's jails to make sure criminal aliens are identified. They 
pointed to a statement Napolitano issued Thursday saying federal resources would be 
used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) 
immigration enforcement priorities."But Montgomery said there was no issue raised by the 
Justice Department about misuse of the federal authority and the county should 
be allowed to continue checking jailed suspects for immigration violations. Arizona law 
requires that illegal immigrants accused of serious crimes be held without bond, 
and losing that authority could lead to people being released who should 
be held.Montgomery also questioned the timing of the Justice Department's findings, because 
a civil rights case that raises similar issues is currently before a 
federal judge in Phoenix. But he acknowledged they raised significant issues, although 
he "is not going to accept the findings at face value.""Nor am 
I going to reject 
HARRISBURG, Pa.  A Penn State assistant football coach testified Friday that 
he believes he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy 
on campus and that he fully conveyed what he had seen to 
two Penn State administrators.Mike McQueary, speaking for the first time in public 
about the 2002 encounter in a Penn State locker room, said he 
believes that Sandusky was attacking the child with his hands around the 
boy's waist but said he wasn't 100 percent sure it was intercourse.McQueary 
took the stand Friday morning in a Pennsylvania courtroom during a preliminary 
hearing for university officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, who are accused 
of lying to a grand jury about what McQueary told them.At the 
conclusion of the hearing, District Judge William C. Wenner ruled that prosecutors 
have enough evidence to send their cases to trial.McQueary's story is central 
to the case against Curley and Schultz. They testified to the grand 
jury that McQueary never

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  A federal judge has denied a government request for an 
additional mental health evaluation for a man accused of firing shots at 
the White House.U.S. Magistrate John Facciola said Friday that prosecutors could request 
such an evaluation in the future, if it becomes necessary. But the 
judge said that currently, there's no evidence to suggest Oscar Ramiro Ortega-Hernandez 
is incompetent to stand trial.Ortega is accused of using an assault rifle 
last month to fire on the White House in an alleged attempt 
to assassinate President Barack Obama. The president was out of town.A preliminary 
psychiatric screening found Ortega competent to stand trial, but federal prosecutors asked 
for more extensive tests to make certain they could proceed with the 
case.
 APDec. 16: Colton Harris-Moore, also known as the 'Barefoot Bandit' glances at 
the courtroom gallery as he walks to the defense table, in Island 
County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and 
distressed people ... They didn't know if they came back from vacation 
their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total 
of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, thef
tprints on the floor and wall.That plane crashed near Granite Falls, Wash., 
after it ran out of fuel.He made his way to Oregon in 
a 32-foot boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first to leave 
$100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Wash. From Oregon, authorities said, 
Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from the parking 
lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane and made 
for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles away, where authorities finally caught 
him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.Fox bought the movie rights 
in a deal that could be worth $1.3 million, and Dustin Lance 
Black, who won an Academy Award for writing the movie "Milk," about 
the gay rights activist Harvey Milk, is working on the screenplay. He's 
met with Harris-Moore several times at the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, 
according to Lance Rosen, Harris-Moore's entertainment lawyer.Harris-Moore doesn't get to keep any
