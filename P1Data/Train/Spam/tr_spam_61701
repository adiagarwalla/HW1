                  Dear Reader,<br><br>
                  Have you heard about the latest Obama tax? It's about to increase everyone's expenses in a big way in 2014.<br><br>
                  It could cost ordinary folks anywhere from $200 to $400 per month. In some cases even a lot more, depending on your tax status.<br><br>
                  Will you have to pay it? And is there a way out of this outrageous tax hike?<br><br><a href="http://quail8did.eu/1c8ef6a1a45414556ee5c0245aa1_f1a9c554-010101030001/C/x=honwj/m=fxr/b=C932D9DD/0546">The full breakdown is here</a>. Please give this a look. I believe it will save a lot of people a good deal of money in 2014 - and in years to come.<br><br>
                  Sincerely,<br><br><img border="0"  src="http://quail8did.eu/images/0113_MikeWard_sig.png" width="166" alt=""><br><br>

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.024.—Zephyr Eggs.

Beat four eggs very light, add to them a pint of cream, season with salt and pepper. Butter small moulds and pour in the mixture, stand the moulds in a pan with about 2 inches of water, steam 20 minutes. Turn them out and pour a rich brown gravy around them. Garnish with chopped olives and red chillies.
25.—English Bread Pudding.

Grease small cups and fill 2/3 full with bread crumbs and a little chopped candied fruit; beat 2 eggs without separating and 2 tablespoonfuls of sugar and 1½ cups of milk. Pour this carefully over the crumbs and stand the cups in a pan of boiling water and bake in a moderate oven 15 minutes.[Pg 37] Turn out and serve with a vanilla or wine sauce.
26.—Tomato Jelly Salad.

Cook a can of tomatoes with ½ an onion, a stalk of celery, a bay leaf and pepper and salt. Dissolve ¾ of a box of gelatine in ½ a cup of cold water. Add the gelatine to the tomato and strain into small round moulds; serve each one on a lettuce leaf with a circle of mayonnaise dressing around.
27.—Clams Sauteed and Creamed.

Chop fine two strings of soft shell clams after washing them. Melt one large tablespoonful of butter in a frying pan, add the clams and stir frequently until they are nicely browned. Keep well broken with a spoon. When browned dredge over them 1 heaping tablespoonful of butter and stir again until it is absorbed and browned, then add gradually 1 cupful of milk, stirring until it is smooth and thick. Season well with salt and pepper, simmer for 5 minutes and serve on toast.—"Table Talk," Phila.
28.—Cheese Fondue No. 1.

Beat 5 eggs without separating. When[Pg 38] light, add 1 cupful of grated Swiss or mild American cheese, ½ a teaspoonful of salt, ¼ of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and three tablespoonfuls of butter cut into bits. Cook in a double boiler until the cheese has melted and the mixture is smooth and as thick as custard. Pour over hot buttered toast and send at once to the table.—"Table Talk," Phila.
29.—Beef Cutlets.

Trim and cut like cutlets some slices of beef; season. Fry on both sides until done; sprinkle over them chopped parsley, place on a dish and serve with a brown gravy.
30.—German Prune Cake.

For this use a recipe for short cake adding more milk to make it into a thick batter. Turn into a shallow, oblong pan and over the top press lightly into the mixture a close layer of partly cooked prunes. Sprinkle thickly with granulated sugar and bake in a quick oven. Serve hot.—From "Table Talk," Phila.
31.—Dormers.

Chop cold beef very fine, and season it[Pg 39] with salt and pepper, then add some onion chopped fine and fried previously, also some rice boiled very dry. Mix all well together and make into small rounds, flour them and fry until brown. Serve with a hot gravy poured over them.[Pg 40]
