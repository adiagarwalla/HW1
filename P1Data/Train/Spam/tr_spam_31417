e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa
 seasons at least three or four times a week during the season. 
I love the grilled cheese.Catchings has another in with Gisele: she got 
to know Bundchens Brady back in 2004 when she was invited by 
President George W. Bush to attend the State of the Union address, 
and the two were seated together.He was cool  really laid-back to 
down-to-earth, she said. He came and introduced himself, and we talked about 
how cool the opportunity to be was and just talked about our 
sports.Morgan Greenlee, a rep for the Indianapolis Convention and Visitors Association, said 
Bundchen should first get acquainted with the city by taking a $10 
Zipline ride.Gisele can ride the nations longest temporary Zipline in February. 96 
high and 800 long  towering over Super Bowl Village, she recommended. 
And then pose with the iconic LOVE sculpture at the Indianapolis Museum 
of Art. Gisele can put the photo in Bradys locker room (which 
will be the Colts locker room) prior to the big game.As for
ventually lead to weapons-grade material and the production of nuclear weapons. Iran 
says its program is for peaceful purposes -- generating electricity and producing 
medical radioisotopes to treat cancer patients.Tehran is under four sets of U.N. 
Security Council sanctions because of its refusal to heed international concerns about 
its nuclear programs, as well as penalties imposed by the United States 
and Western nations meant to force it into dialogue
