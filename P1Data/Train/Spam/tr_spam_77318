spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and 
makes decisions, in a way that will give it vastly expanded power 
to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development,

Janeiro next June.The major focus of the EPA thinking is a we
ess benefits have been a cornerstone of President Obama's and congressional Democrats' 
effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy.The Senate bill, at 
a cost of $33 billion, would cut the payroll tax, extend jobless 
benefits and avoid cuts in Medicare payments to doctors through February. Both

Benedict XVI Joseph Ratzinger as a Nazi, when in fact he was 
involuntarily enrolled as a member of Hitler Youth, but unlike most of 
the other teenagers, Ratzinger refused to go to meetings, bringing economic hardship 
to his family. And 80s songstress Sinead OConnor took things even further 
by tweeting that she would perform a bloodbath if the Pope was 
to visit her home country of Ireland. She later said it was 
just a joke. Ha?#9. Alec BaldwinJust last week Baldwin was removed from 
an American Airlines flight for refusing to turn off his phone. The 
30 Rock star then took to Twitter to make disparaging remarks about 
the airline staff who then publically fired back by exposing his rude 
behavior. And it doesnt end there  the attendants are reportedly now
