erm, citing Harris-Moore's bleak childhood in a Camano Island trailer with an 
alcoholic mother and a series of her convict boyfriends. They laid out 
the details of his upbringing in psychiatric and mitigation reports filed with 
the court.Harris-Moore's first conviction came at age 12, in 2004, for possession 
of stolen property, and according to the reports, his first experience with 
burglary came when he broke into the homes of his classmates to 
steal food because his mother spent most of her Social Security income 
on beer and cigarettes -- something she has denied.Over the next three 
years he was convicted of theft, burglary, malicious mischief and assault, among 
other crimes. At one point he was arrested when a detective posed 
as a pizza-delivery driver.In 2007, the boy was sentenced to three years 
in a juvenile lockup after pleading guilty to three burglary counts in 
Island County. But he fled the minimum-security facility in April 2008 and 
was soon back to
100,000 ($130,000) depending on the nature of the abuse.He said he felt 
personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t
 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o

the worst. Were on the pointed end of the stick. ... We 
come to work with that on our mind.
 WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid 
out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at 
the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips 
in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and 
eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell 
was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's 
car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell 
said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased 
night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we 
will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient 
for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final spree came after he 
stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from 
a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare foo
