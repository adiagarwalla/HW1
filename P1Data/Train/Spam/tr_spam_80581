<font color="white" size="1">WASHINGTON  Lawmakers have freed up a little more than 20 percent 
of $187 million in U.S. assistance to the Palestinians that had been 
frozen over the Palestinian bid for U.N. membership.Members of Congress have made 
available $40 million in economic and humanitarian funding for the Palestinians, the 
State Department said Wednesday. The money is administered by the U.S. Agency 
for International Development and "has been vital to establishing and strengthening the

the U.S. as hypocritical for lecturing other nations on the subject of 
rights."The situation in the United States is a far cry from the 
ideals that Washington proclaims," says the report released Wednesday.Moscow has previously reacted 
angrily to the accusations of human rights breaches that the U.S. State 
Department has leveled at Russia in its annual reports. The State Department 
has expressed concern about the violent attacks on rights activists and journalists 
in Russia, most of which go unpunished. It also has criticized abuses 
in Russia's Caucasus, including extrajudicial killings, kidnappings and torture.The 90-page Russian report
