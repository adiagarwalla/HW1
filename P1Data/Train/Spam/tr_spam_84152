Republican president hopeful Newt Gingrich doubled down on his criticism of federal 
judges and the Supreme Court on Sunday as chief rival Mitt Romney 
defended his record against likely Democratic attacks.With close to two weeks before 
GOP voters start choosing their nominee, Gingrich is courting the conservative primary 
voters he will need to win in Iowa and sustain his campaign 
against Romney, whose superior organization and pile of cash has him seeming 
ever more confident as he looks ahead to the general election."There is 
steady encroachment of secularism through the courts to redefine America as a 
nonreligious country and the encroachment of the courts on the president's commander-in-chief 
powers, which is enormously dangerous," Gingrich said on CBS's Face the Nation.Polls 
in Iowa and nationally show Gingrich ahead of Romney in the race 
for the GOP nomination. Gingrich has acknowledged that Romney's repeated attacks have 
taken a toll on his campaign and is l
, Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.
spokesman Chris Whitmire said he was not aware of any concerns.But Douglas 
Jones, a computer science professor at the University of Iowa who has 
consulted for both political parties, said the Iowa Republican Party is right 
to be concerned about the security of their computer systems. The Internet, 
he said, is "becoming more and more like the Wild West.""It's very 
clear the data consolidation and data gathering from the caucuses, which determines 
the headlines the next morning, who might withdraw or resign from the 
process, all of that is fragile," Jones said. "If I were one 
of these `hacktivists' who had no scruples, I would be really strongly 
tempted to see if I could get into the computer and see 
if I could make `SpongeBob SquarePants' win."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">igars, cognac and gourmet cuisine -- was believed to have had diabetes 
and heart disease.South Korean media, including Yonhap news agency, said South Korea 
put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak convened a 
national security council meeting after the news of Kim's death. Officials couldn't 
immediately confirm the reports.In September 2010, Kim Jong Il unveiled his third 
son, the twenty-something Kim Jong Un, as his successor, putting him in 
high-ranking posts.State media called Kim Jong Un the "great successor" to the 
nation's principles Monday, encouraging support for the heir-apparent.It also said saying citizens 
must "respectfully revere" Kim Jong Un."At the leadership of comrade Kim Jong 
Un, we have to change sadness to strength and courage and overcome 
today's difficulties," it said.Traffic in the North Korean capital was moving as 
usual Monday, but people in the streets were in tears as they 
learned the news of Kim's death. A foreigner
 ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
spokesman Paul Browne said. The attacker sprayed Gillespie in the face and 
continued to spray her "sort of methodically" over her head and parts 
of her body as her bags of groceries draped off her arms, 
Browne said.Then, Browne said, the attacker pulled out a barbecue-style lighter and 
used it to ignite a rag in a bottle. He waited a 
few seconds as Gillespie huddled on the floor. Then he backed out 
of the elevator and tossed the flaming bottle in.Neighbors in the Prospect 
Heights building quickly reported a fire, but had no idea that a 
woman was being burned alive.Isaac, reeking of gasoline, went into a police 
station overnight and implicated himself in Gillespie's death, Browne said. The suspect 
told police he set her on fire because she owed him $2,000 
for some work he had done for her, Browne said.Jaime Holguin, who 
lives on the same floor as Gillespie, saw surveillance pictures of the 
attacker and said, "Oh, my God!"Holguin, the manager of news development
