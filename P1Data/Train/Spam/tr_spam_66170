		 and creamy), I began to feel very ill.   I ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, 17818507 final and worst part of it all. I think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  Sometimes you irradiate yourself.  This was more of 17818507 latter.   A lot of nice little things, such as 17818507 help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   I also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it. Walking around in Caesars, we quickly realized that we needed more drinks and some food. At that moment, we found ourselves in front of Mesa Grill and walked up to 17818507 bar. I have been to Mesa many times before, but 17818507 first time we just decided to just sit at 17818507 bar instead of getting a table. I actually found my experience at 17818507 bar far more enjoyable and oddly enough, a lot cheaper than usual. They only have an appetizer menu at 17818507 bar, but when all of 17818507 food is good like it is at Mesa, it really isn't a big deal and there is something for everyone. 17818507 only disappointment was they had taken their calamari off 17818507 menu (both 17818507 bar and standard menu)... Sad considering I was really looking forward to it. While we were there, some random guy who is completely drunk and blitzed out of his mind, walks right up to us and goes on and on about this magician, Chris Randall, that he knows and who works at Mesa. He was shocked we had no idea who this magician was and for 17818507 next 15 minutes, he repeatedly was saying that we had to Google Chris Randall. He then gets 17818507 bartender involved and repeats his tirade. 17818507 bartender doesn't know anyone who works there by that name. 17818507 drunk guy asks for 17818507 manager and repeats 17818507 tirade again. No one knows who he is talking about, he gives us random door passes to some club (yes, 17818507 same ones they pass out on 17818507 bridges between 17818507 hotels) and he promptly leaves. It was pretty funny because he was just annihilated drunk. And yes... when I got home from my trip, I did Google 17818507 guy's name (turns out he is a local Vegas magician). LOL Anywho, if you haven't tried 17818507 bar at Mesa Grill, you should definitely check it out. 17818507 service is great, 17818507 appetizers at Mesa are a foodies bar food, and if your lucky, you will get some random drunk strike up a conversation to where you can laugh about 17818507 experience with 17818507 bartender for 17818507 rest of 17818507 night. I've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants
