APNov. 6, 2011: Demonstrators march with a replica of a pipeline during 
a protest to demand a stop to the Keystone XL tar sands 
oil pipeline in Washington, D.C.A senior House GOP aid tells Fox News 
that the House is opposed to the payroll tax deal passed in 
the Senate that includes provisions regarding a proposed Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline.The aid 
says House Republicans oppose the bill because they believe it will impose 
more hardships on the already struggling middle class.They may seek to amend 
the Senate bill.These comments only give further uncertainty to the future of 
the pipeline, which was addressed in the bowels of the $33 billion 
package passed by the Senate Saturday. The bill would extend the payroll 
tax cut as well as unemployment aid, and includes a tricky provision 
that would require President Obama to decide in 60 days whether to 
approve the permit for the so-called Keystone XL pipeline.Republican lawmakers, unions and 
some Democrats want the p
king the can down the road.""The American people are tired of that. 
I think, frankly, I'm tired of it. On the House side, we've 
seen this kind of action before coming out of the Senate. It's 
time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend 
this for one year," Boehner said.But Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Boehner 
has no room to complain after agreeing last week to abide by 
a deal worked out between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell. House Republicans have said they played no role in 
last week's talks between the two Senate leaders"Last week, Speaker Boehner sat 
in a meeting with Leader Reid and Leader McConnell and he gave 
Leader McConnell his proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. ... The Senate 
came to a deal, and now Speaker Boehner must keep his word," 
Schumer said in a statement release Sunday.Schumer said failure to pass the 
legislation could cost Republicans their majority in the House, "and

state, the last thing we want to do is have a situation 
where there is trouble with the reporting system. We don't want that 
to be the story," said Wes Enos, a member of the central 
committee and the political director for Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's campaign in 
Iowa.The two-minute video features a computer-generated voice denouncing what it calls a 
corrupt political system that favors corporations and calls on supporters to "peacefully 
shut down the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses." The video claims to be from 
Anonymous, a loosely organized group of hackers that has claimed credit for 
attacks on targets ranging from the Peruvian government to Paypal.A former activist 
for Occupy Des Moines, Clarke Davidson, has acknowledged posting the video on 
YouTube. He said he did so after masked men left it outside 
his tent near the state Capitol on Nov. 3.Investigators aren't sure whether

 SARI, Iran  A fired factory worker who threw his shoes at 
the Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad during a visit to the northern city 
of Sari, has been arrested, the Mehr news agency reported Monday.The man 
conducted the shoe-throwing attack as Ahmadinejad delivered a speech. The shoes missed 
the president and struck a banner set up behind him, according to 
the report.The attacker was reportedly a textile worker who had lost his 
job.Throwing shoes at a person is a major insult in the Muslim 
world. In 2008, an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at then-US President 
George W. Bush during a news conference.
hey'll safeguard the material the way that they've been taught," she said.The 
defense has emphasized what it regards as a failure by Manning's closest 
supervisor, Sgt. 1st Class Paul Adkins, to suspend the intelligence security clearance 
after at least two fits of rage by the private during which 
he overturned furniture. Adkins refused to testify Sunday when called to do 
so for the government.Other testimony revealed that Manning, serving in Iraq in 
2009 and 2010, was sometimes angry and distant with others from his 
unit. The defense has said that Manning, who is gay, was bullied 
by fellow soldiers. Manning's defense team says he told Adkins he suffered 
from gender-identity disorder -- the belief that he was born the wrong 
sex.Manning is accused of leaking a wealth of secret information, including hundreds 
of thousands of battlefield reports and State Department cables, contrary to the 
Espionage Act and the law against aiding the enemy.Disclosures surfaced on th
