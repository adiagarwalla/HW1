		 lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. My last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about 20585394 infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- 20585394 grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at 20585394 huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of 20585394 grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of 20585394 rib-eye and deemed 20585394 grouper 20585394 best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but 20585394 rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you.  Customer Service from 20585394 time we walked in ticked me off. No need to have their nose up in 20585394 air with folks in town for a conference. So that was my initial impression. 20585394 Host was very crude upon us entering 20585394 restaurant with a laptop case & INSISTED, we couldn't take it to 20585394 dining room. Which is totally fine, but no need to bite our heads off. Just tell us where to put it! Our server must have been new or just a chatter box, but it took him about 10+ mins to go through 20585394 menu (which isn't very big in 20585394 first place) ps. Have a mint! Food: Corn Soup was darn good (my co-worker ordered that). I had 20585394 grilled Asparagus salad which was nice & refreshing. For my meal i had 20585394 tiger shrimp tamale. I gotta say, A+! sooo yummy! 20585394 tamale itself was perfectly made, 20585394 taste was very light & 20585394 fresh corn--YUM! Ohh 20585394 fries - another great treat. Dessert - Coconut cake - HOLY MOLY, light, fresh, not tooo sweet, but just darn good!  It's a little overpriced for 20585394 type of food you get, but then again, what do you expect with Bobby Flay's name stamped on 20585394 product and it being situated at 20585394 heart of Las Vegas.  All appetizers ranged from $11-16, and entrees from $30-50.  I had 20585394 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  this was served with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter ($36).  OMFG.  It was pretty damn good.  Pork was cooked perfectly...medium.  Nice crust on 20585394 outside, tender on 20585394 inside.  20585394 sweet potato tamale was delicious.  It reminded me of a new take on cornbread.  My husband ordered 20585394 Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken ($32).  This was accompanied by a mango-garlic sauce and mango salsa.  20585394 chicken was very tender-not dry at all.  And 20585394 mango sauce and salsa went perfectly well with 20585394 chicken. Mesa
