 Libya later next year, the U.S. could consider granting asylum."The perception 
is just because these folks received the scholarship from the Qaddafi family 
they are somehow aligned ... with the Qaddafi family," said Eugenia Zacks-Carney, 
an immigration attorney who has been working with the Libyans at Michigan 
State. "Nothing could be further from the truth."Michigan State launched the program 
in 2010 under a contract with Libya's National Economic Development Board to 
provide training in English, political science and international relations for future foreign 
service officials. Elbergwa, who describes her family as middle-class, was working toward 
a master's degree in international relations in Benghazi when she entered the 
program.She said that for those interested in public service in Libya, there 
was no alternative to dealing with the Qaddafi regime."Everything in the country 
was controlled by their family. ... We liked to call Libya `Qaddafi's 
farm,"' sai
 is warranted, frankly, because an insecure North Korea could well be 
an even more dangerous North Korea."South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration said 
Monday that the South had also completed the deployment of its indigenous 
guided missile, Yonhap reported.Cross-border tensions have been high since Seoul accused Pyongyang 
of torpedoing a warship off the east coast of the peninsula with 
the loss of 46 lives in March 2010. The North denied the 
charge but went on to shell the Yeonpyeong border island, briefly sparking 
fears of war.Since then, Seoul has staged a series of military exercises 
either alone or jointly with its ally the US in a show 
of force, while Pyongyang routinely test fires short-range missiles either as part 
of a training exercise or as a reaction to political developments.NewsCore and 
Fox News' Jennifer Griffin contributed to this report.
APNov. 6, 2011: Demonstrators march with a replica of a pipeline during 
a protest to demand a stop to the Keystone XL tar sands 
oil pipeline in Washington, D.C.A senior House GOP aid tells Fox News 
that the House is opposed to the payroll tax deal passed in 
the Senate that includes provisions regarding a proposed Canada-to-Texas oil pipeline.The aid 
says House Republicans oppose the bill because they believe it will impose 
more hardships on the already struggling middle class.They may seek to amend 
the Senate bill.These comments only give further uncertainty to the future of 
the pipeline, which was addressed in the bowels of the $33 billion 
package passed by the Senate Saturday. The bill would extend the payroll 
tax cut as well as unemployment aid, and includes a tricky provision 
that would require President Obama to decide in 60 days whether to 
approve the permit for the so-called Keystone XL pipeline.Republican lawmakers, unions and 
some Democrats want the p

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDecember 1, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio leaves his news 
conference on Capitol Hill in Washington.WASHINGTON  House Republicans will vote down 
a two-month payroll tax bill approved by the Senate this weekend, saying 
Monday that short-term solutions create instability for the economy and push the 
problem of a negotiating a longer deal into next year."Americans are tired 
of short-term fixes. Democrats and Republicans agreed that a payroll tax cut 
needs to be extended for a full year. The House passed a 
bill to do just that," said House Speaker John Boehner.Boehner said the 
House will vote to disagree with the Senate-backed bill approved Saturday and 
take their own legislation to conference with Senate negotiators through the regular 
order of business.But Senate Democrats say Saturday's vote was expected to be 
the last one of the year, and they have no plans to 
return to Washington before the next session in January. They add that 
they considered th

EPA to foster sustainable development without further congressional approval in the wording 
of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, or NEPA. The study 
says the law, the cornerstone of U.S. environmental policy, declared that the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government is to create and maintain conditions, 
under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit 
fulfilling the social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.(In 
fact, the study quotes selectively from that portion of NEPA. What that 
section of the Act says in full is that it is the 
continuing policy of the Federal Government, in cooperation with State and local 
governments, and other concerned public and private organizations, to use all practicable 
means and measures, including financial and technical assistance, in a manner calculated 
to foster and promote the genera
, Kenji Fujimoto, a former Japanese sushi chef for Kim Jong Il, 
described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.
