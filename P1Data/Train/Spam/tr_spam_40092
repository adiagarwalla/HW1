Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know

APFeb. 1: Anti oil floating barriers are pushed by strong winds around 
the grounded cruise ship Costa Concordia off the Tuscan island of Giglio, 
Italy.GIGLIO, Italy  Italian authorities say they have identified another person killed 
when the Costa Concordia cruise ship capsized last month -- a German 
woman named Siglinde Stumpf.Stumpf was identified Wednesday by the prefecture in the 
city of Grosseto, a body that represents the Rome government.Strumpf is the 
17th person whose body has been identified following the grounding of the 
cruise ship on Jan. 13.The Grosseto prefecture now lists 15 others as 
still missing. The search for them, however, has been hampered by rough 
seas and a decision not to keep looking within the submerged hulk 
of the ship, which is considered too dangerous now.
