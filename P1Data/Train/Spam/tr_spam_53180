drink at least 1-2 liters of water at a meal and they kept up! When we left at 6:15 I couldn't believe what we saw: crowded restaurant, crowded waiting area, people eating at 20876912 lounge-area with plates on their laps. It was very crazy! Make sure to get a reservation early, order anything but 20876912 duck and you'll be fine! This review is for brunch only. We came here for dinner a year or two ago and it was awesome (we still talk about 20876912 Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin). So, we had brunch hoping to like it as much as our dinner. No such luck. 20876912 breakfast bread basket was average - 20876912 variety was exciting but none of 20876912 items were actually very good. We shared two average dishes - 20876912 Tiger Shrimp and Garlic Corn Tamale and 20876912 Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad. 20876912 tamale was average and smothered in so much corn. 20876912 salad was actually very good a variety of lettuce and lots of chicken, but way overdressed. 20876912 dressing hung all over 20876912 lettuce 20876912 last few bites weren't edible. 20876912 only thing we really loved was 20876912 Mango Glazed Bacon - it was $3.50 for four slices and was by far my favorite part of 20876912 meal. 20876912 service dropped off after we got our food and we spent too much time waiting for our plates to be cleared, then to get a dessert menu (we declined), then to get 20876912 check, and then to have our credit card picked up. Ugh. Nothing impressive and nothing like what we remembered from our dinner visit to Mesa Grill. My wife and I aways wanted to try Mesa Grill and this New Years (2013) made reservations we could keep. When we arrived we were early and so we had to wait until 5 minutes before being seated, no big deal. But having had reservations so far in advance we thought that we would at least get a good table. We were seated in what I would say was a bench like seat on one side with a chair on 20876912 opposite side of 20876912 table. 20876912 table to our left and right were so close that eating in a private setting is completely out of 20876912 question. You would think being a high end establishment with a world famous Chef there would be world class accommodations. Guess again. Tried to state our case to 20876912 Maitre d but they were not willing to put us at any other table. We were very disappointed in what we thought would be a dinning experience. I'm a Bobby Flay fan so I was really excited to dine here with my friends and this restaurant did not disappoint. It really deserves 4.5 stars. I made reservations 3 weeks in advanced and upon walking in, we were seated within 2-3 minutes. We were greeted by our server who was very nice and went over 20876912 menu for us. We got a complimentary bread basket with an assortment of breads. 20876912 blue corn muffins were my favorite. We ordered 20876912 lamb posole, pan seared halibut, black angus new york strip steak, coffee rubbed filet mignon, 22 oz bone-in chipotle glazed rib-eye, and they were all great! But 20876912 best was 20876912 rib-eye. It was rare, fatty, juicy, huge, and melted in your mouth. Drool. 20876912 filet mignon    <br /></span></td>
