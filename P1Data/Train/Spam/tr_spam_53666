 sentenced to 120 days behind bars, but due to jail overcrowding 
served the sentence under house arrest. While under arrest, the Mean Girls 
star failed a random alcohol test, and later violated court-ordered community service. 
She was slapped with yet another jail sentence (her fifth in four 
years) but again spent a mere few hours in the clink. Lohan 
has been ordered to spend most of her days doing community service 
at the L.A. County morgue, but even on her first day in 
attendance she couldnt manage to arrive on time, despite stern warnings from 
the Judge, and was turned away in disgust. Plus she posed nude 
for Playboy!In almost any other year, this would have snagged her the 
top spot easy, but in 2011 she had some extra special competition...#1. 
Charlie SheenThis year's winner, the man with Adonis DNA and tiger blood, 
Mr. Charlie Sheen! The fired Two-and-a-Half Men star launched a movement across 
the country, berating his sitcom colleagues, executive produce

he was born in Siberia in 1941.The elder Kim fought for independence 
from Korea's colonial ruler, Japan, from a base in Russia for years. 
He returned to Korea in 1945, emerging as a communist leader and 
becoming North Korea's first leader in 1948.He meshed Stalinist ideology with a 
cult of personality that encompassed him and his son. Their portraits hang 
in every building in North Korea, and every dutiful North Korean wears 
a Kim Il Sung lapel pin.Kim Jong Il, a graduate of Pyongyang's 
Kim Il Sung University, was 33 when his father anointed him his 
eventual successor.Even before he took over, there were signs the younger Kim 
would maintain -- and perhaps exceed -- his father's hard-line stance.South Korea 
has accused Kim of masterminding a 1983 bombing that killed 17 South 
Korean officials visiting Burma, now known as Myanmar. In 1987, the bombing 
of a Korean Air flight killed all 115

appears to be an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report on drone 
warfare, posted on a website, found that communications links are a "primary 
target of the adversary" in robotic aircraft operations.The April 2011 report added: 
"Small, simple GPS  jammers can be easily constructed and employed by 
an unsophisticated adversary and would be effective over a limited RPA (remotely 
piloted aircraft) operating area," the report said.The website, Public Intelligence, describes itself 
as an international consortium of independent researchers dedicated to providing access open-source 
intelligence materials. Some independent U.S. experts confirmed that the document accurately describes 
a well-known potential vulnerability in drones.But Ted Beneigh, an expert on unmanned 
aircraft systems at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said it was "highly 
unlikely" that the Iran

fatally struck by ricocheting bullets. Kasymov conceded, however, that the police force 
would have to put in place better contingency planning for the deployment 
of nonlethal crowd control techniques.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
chairperson-in-office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, expressed his concern in a statement 
at the measures adopted in suppressing the disorder."Any action to control crowds

APFaeirouz Elbergwa was among an elite group of Libyans selected by the 
family of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi to come to the U.S. for 
a two-year diplomatic training program.EAST LANSING, Mich.  More than two years 
ago, Faeirouz Elbergwa was among a select group of Libyans sent by 
her government to an American university to train for the nation's diplomatic 
corps. As she prepares for the final stage of her studies, she 
and her colleagues now find themselves in an odd state of limbo 
-- a vestige of a regime that no longer exists and unsure 
what might await them in their much-changed homeland.Elbergwa, 27, and 18 colleagues 
in a Libyan diplomatic training program at Michigan State University watched in 
amazement during the last year as the North African nation was convulsed 
by a violent revolution that ended with the overthrow and death of 
leader Muammar Qaddafi.When the regime fell, many of the students were elated.
