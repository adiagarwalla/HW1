Concerned U.S. Citizen, lima@fs.net.

I've realized there are glearing warning signals for an imminent market crash There is a 70 percent chance it will happen - and with it will come a 25-year depression.

My colleagues at the CIA are getting ready for a meltdown in the wake of this trillion-dollar-crisis.  I want you to be prepared. 

I'd like to rush you a complimentary copy of my book, The Death of Money, which will 
include the controversial unpublished chapter, and will prepare you for this change. 

Go here to protect your financial security and the effects of another Great Depression,

Details are available only through 1-21-15.



For your Safety,

James K. Rickards
Former CIA Economist

When Miss Bad Idea Bear and I used to work together, 24767919 she would frequently get on my case for daydreaming and not paying attention.  She once threw a stuffed animal over our shared cube, which smacked me in the face, to knock me out of daydreaming.

What was a daydreaming about? Sometimes Julianne Moore, 24767919 but other times it would be something practical, like what to eat for lunch.  I found myself daydreaming about The House's tuna BLT sandwich the other day, and wound up coming here for the second time that week.

This place gets crowded during lunch time, and since I'm never sure when I'll be pulled into another meeting, I wasn't able to make a reservation, so I found myself sprinting to this place to get a seat.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
