tend a payroll tax cut through 2012, with major disagreements remaining over 
how to finance the package.The spending bill advanced after Democrats blocked a 
series of GOP assaults on Environmental Protection Agency regulations, though the agency's 
budget absorbed a cut of more than 3 percent.GOP leaders did succeed 
in delays in regulations of coal dust and eliminating federal funding of 
needle exchange programs.War costs would be $115 billion, a $43 billion cut 
from the previous year.
providing his charming comic relief. New to the team are Paula Patton 
(Precious) and Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker). Renner, juggling the more physical 
action with emotional moments, is an excellent addition to the cast.Kudos to 
Cruise and producer J.J. Abrams for hiring director Brad Bird. Ghost Protocol 
is Birds first live action feature film. Hes renowned at Pixar having 
directed modern animated classics The Incredibles and Ratatouille. Birds artistic eye, attention 
to detail and primary focus on character bring a welcome maturity to 
"Mission: Impossible" without sacrificing any of the excitement. Bird keeps the film 
classy, filling every frame with lush detail then juxtaposing with incredible hair-raising 
action.If possible, see Ghost Protocol in IMAX, where Robert Elswits lush cinematography 
and Michael Giacchinos fun melodic score will stimulate your eyes and ears.

 The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Shown here is Media Matters CEO David Brock. Two left-leaning Washington organizations 
are facing heated criticism for their Israel-related coverage and commentary after throwing 
around the disparaging term "Israel firster" and accusing the Simon Wiesenthal Center 
-- a group dedicated to tolerance -- of being a "far-right" outfit.The 
comments by writers for the Center for American Progress, a think tank, 
and Media Matters, a media advocacy group, have received increasing attention over 
the past week, in particular for their criticism of American supporters of 
Israel and for their repeated downplaying of the threat posed by a 
nuclear Iran. The CAP also was reproached for its criticism of the 
Simon Wiesenthal Center as a partisan outfit.The Wiesenthal Center responded this week 
with a lengthy statement that condemned the remarks and suggested that the 
organizations are trying to make it difficult for others "to take a 
position sympathetic to the Jewish state."At i

the situation in the North African nation while allowing him to pay 
tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi and trying to create 
a democratic government.Carney said the U.S. looked forward "to a continued close 
partnership with the new government of Libya during this transitional period and 
beyond, and believe that these assets can be an important resource for 
the Libyan people."

Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore hid 
out for long periods in the second level of his hangar at 
the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on trips 
in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house and 
eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while Parnell 
was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his wife's 
car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," Parnell 
said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We purchased 
night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when we 
will finally know what the consequences are, and I hope it's sufficient 
for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final spree came after he 
stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and took a plane from
