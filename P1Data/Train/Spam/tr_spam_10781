the first stage of the Ares 1 rocket that NASA planned to 
use to launch the Orion capsule on trips to the moon. The 
rocket was shelved after the agency's moon-bound Constellation program was scrapped.Liberty will 
use the original Ares 1 engine as a first stage and European 
aerospace firm Astrium's workhorse Ariane 5 rocket as the second stage. The 
massive Liberty rocket will tower at 300 feet (91 meters) tall, company 
officials have said. [The World's Tallest Rockets: How They Stack Up]"Liberty can 
lift more than any other system," Rominger said. "Our capabilities can carry 
seven crew and significant cargo, which I think is unique. We really 
are a launch system designed for the 21st century to bring better

and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances 
to argue that he's in favor of gay rights -- without putting 
the president on record for or against gay marriage.Obama, in additional segments 
from the ABC interview, noted that much of the debate is "generational,"

Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student battling a 
deadly flesh-eating virus, is showing signs of recovery and is still fighting 
to survive."Aimee has made drastic improvements today," Andy Copeland, Aimee's father, told 
FoxNews.com. "Yesterday, she had some setbacks. She was really on the ventilator 
100 percent, but now she's only requiring 60 percent of the ventilator,
