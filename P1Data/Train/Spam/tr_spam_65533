ns raised by board members about Raykovitz's handling of information regarding the 
2002 shower incident, saying to do so would be a distraction from 
the goal of helping serve children.The board of directors of a children's 
charity is responsible for making sure that it operates under reasonable policies 
and prores to protect children, according to Daniel Borochoff, president of Chicago-based 
Charity Watch. Individual board members can face lawsuits for failing in their 
oversight duties, and The Second Mile insures its board members against such 
claims.The Second Mile has been named in two civil complaints, including one 
that seeks to preserve the charity's assets.David Marshall, a Washington, D.C., lawyer 
who represents other accusers, said: "It may have been only Sandusky who 
laid his hands on these children, but it is clear that a 
number of other individuals and agencies placed the children in harm's way 
by knowingly taking actions that allowed the abuse t
resident Lee Myung-bak at midnight and the two leaders agreed to stay 
in close touch."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to the 
stability of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally, 
the Republic of Korea," the White House said in a statement.Obama and 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were both briefed on Kim's death, 
the White House and State Department said.South Korea's military and police were 
placed on a high alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an 
emergency national security council meeting.Kim's death was announced by state media in 
a "special broadcast" from Pyongyang late Sunday. The report said Kim died 
of a heart ailment on a train due to a "great mental 
and physical strain" on Dec. 17 during a "high intensity field inspection." 
North Korea will hold a national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's 
funeral will be held on Dec. 28, it said.The U.S. officials stressed 
that North Korea's past behavi

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su

risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
  even shoes for young children, he said.Although he said government agencies 
were responding in a quick and efficient manner, they were overwhelmed and 
the United Nations was preparing an appeal for urgent assistance from donors 
and foreign governments.

adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father 
did after taking power in 1994, potentially lea
