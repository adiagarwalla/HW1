Dear Subscriber,

Be prepared - there is a new scandal that is just about to break.

This scandal is about what we have learned to be a GIANT conspiracy between our government and most of the biggest food producers in the U.S.

This alarming story is so controversial that Fox-News not banned it from being shown, but they fired the 2 reporters who were trying to air it.

If you are happy with our president, you shouldn't bother even watching this presentation.

This is so shocking that many people are going to want to IMPEACH Obama for what he's been doing...This may be the thing that finally takes him down.

I have to warn you though, what you are going to find out might seriously turn your stomach.


Sincerely,
Doug Hill

19728857 blue corn pancake, although a bit soggy, was a nice touch. Fire Roasted Veal Chop 19728857 most delicious, succulent, tender chop of veal I have EVER tasted. Topped with a spicy sauce that was truly incredible and a perfect balance of sweet, spicy and tart New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin GF ordered this one and she asked for it well done. I know, I know, I tried to help her understand that medium or medium rare pork is not a good idea, unless you are visiting a fine dining establishment such as this one. Despite 19728857 fact that it was well done (and cooked perfectly considering 19728857 fauz pas) this dish was killer! It was tender, spicy, sweet contrast and just delicious, served with a tangy and spicy BBQ sauce that was an excellent compliment to 19728857 dish. Coconut Cake This cake is moist, soft, spongy and amazing! As many non coconut fans are thinking (I hate coconut) not to worry. It's 19728857 freshest combination of coconut flavor and sweetness, with an piping hot (luke warm) cup of coffee, makes for 19728857 perfect dessert. Had I not given up drinking years ago, I would have enjoyed a glass of Port with this dessert and it would have been 19728857 perfect yin to this sweet and tasty yang.
