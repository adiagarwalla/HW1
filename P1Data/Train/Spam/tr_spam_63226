BERLIN -- Rebels in Germany's junior governing party failed on Friday to 
turn it against eurozone efforts to set up a permanent rescue fund, 
an outcome that averts a possible political crisis for Chancellor Angela Merkel.Dissenters 
in the struggling pro-market Free Democratic Party had forced the ballot on 
whether lawmakers in the party should support the euro500 billion ($650 billion) 
European StabilityMechanism, which is due to take start work next year.However, the 
party's embattled leader, Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler, said that their motion was 
defeated by 10,841 votes to 8,809. There were 280 abstentions in the 
ballot, conducted by mail over recent weeks."The FDP is, and remains, a 
party with a clear pro-European direction, with the necessary economic policy good 
sense," said Roesler, who is also Germany's economy minister.Leaders of the party 
have talked tough on Europe's debt crisis but support the rescue fund, 
a cornerstone of efforts led by Merkel t
ould produce thousands of jobs and lessen the nation's dependence on oil 
produced in nations that are often hostile to the United States.Some also 
accused of Obama of intentionally delaying the project until after the 2012 
elections.The pipeline would pass through Montana, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma and 
Texas.Officials in most states support the project, but the pipeline ran into 
intense opposition in Nebraska from environmentalists, landowners, lawmakers and others who were 
worried because the pipeline would cross the Sandhills region. The expanse of 
sandy-soil hills sits atop the massive Ogallala aquifer, a major irrigation water 
source that sits beneath parts of eight states.Girling predicted that resistance to 
the Keystone XL would ease once Nebraska approves a new route that 
avoids the Sandhills region, but he said some opponents would never be 
satisfied."Our intent is to work on alleviating those issues that were of 
primary concern to Nebrask

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">or 10 days later, McQueary said he met with Curley and Schultz 
and told them he'd seen Sandusky and a boy, both naked, in 
the shower after hearing skin-on-skin slapping sounds."I told them that I saw 
Jerry in the showers with a young boy and that what I 
had seen was extremely sexual and over the lines and it was 
wrong," McQueary said. "I would have described that it was extremely sexual 
and I thought that some kind of intercourse was going on."McQueary said 
he was left with the impression both men took his report seriously. 
When asked why he didn't go to police, he referenced Schultz's position 
as a vice president at the university who had overseen the campus 
police."I thought I was talking to the head of the police, to 
be frank with you," he said. "In my mind it was like 
speaking to a (district attorney). It was someone who police reported to 
and would know what to do with it."Curley told the grand jury 
that he couldn't recall his specific conversation with
 o has served as the Derry GOP chairman for seven years.Robo-calls are 
a sensitive issue in New Hampshire, which is inundated with political messages 
every four years.Foley was among the New Hampshire Republicans who encouraged state 
prosecutors to go after the state Democratic Party for a separate robo-call 
incident last year. The party agreed to settle the matter this summer 
with a $5,000 fine."You'd like campaigns to observe the law, and the 
law is that you can't do robo-calls to the do-not-call list," Sytek 
said. "It's not the end of the world, but it just shows 
they seem to be making it up as they go along."The state 
attorney general's office confirmed receipt of the complaints and said they were 
being reviewed.
 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
