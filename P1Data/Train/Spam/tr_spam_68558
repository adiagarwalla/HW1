At Risk Investor marklee446@fs.net,

I've realized there are glearing warning signals for a devastating market crash and major losses. With a 70 percent chance it's coming - it will be followed by a 25-year depression.

CIA employees are getting ready for a meltdown in the wake of this trillion-dollar-crisis.  I want you fully prepared. 

Please accept my complimentary copy of my book, "The Death of Money," which will 
include the controversial unpublished chapter, and will prepare you for this financial upheaval.  

This depression is coming. Prepare yourself and protect your assets with this book here -

Limited quantities.  You must order by 1/21/2015 to insure availability.

Ah Cheeseboard, you bring back 2380338 so many memories for me. Went here all the time back in school. It's pretty much a Berkeley rite of passage. If you haven't eaten here, you can't consider yourself a Golden Bear (unless you're lactose intolerant or allergic to wheat or something *THE MORE YOU KNOW*). 

I remember this place so fondly. 2380338 Getting some friends and walking over on beautiful Shattuck right after a hard day of studying or lectures. Always super packed because this place is crazy popular but the wait is made easier when there's live music (there's a small space in the corner for the pianist and bassist, etc). 

The pizza always comes piping hot, just the way I like my pizza. You know it's fresh when you gotta blow off the steam. For the full Cheeseboard experience, you've gotta sit down with your pals on the grassy median right on Shattuck in the middle of the street. That is the quintessential Berkeley memory.6dbe6e3ff1ca6df2bb4bb4a19f88b4f9
