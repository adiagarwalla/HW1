fight to the Obama administration ... to me it's political suicide."Catholic voters 
played a pivotal role in Obama election in 2008 and could be 
important again in November. Based on Fox News exit polling data, Catholics 
made up 27 percent of the electorate three years ago, which translates 
into an estimated 35 million voters.Obama won 54 percent of the Catholic 
vote in 2008, a nine-point edge over Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, 
and White House officials are downplaying any political fallout now."We understand that 
not everyone agrees with it," Carney said of the decision. "All I 
can tell you is it was made after very careful consideration based 
on the need to balance ... (religious rights and) the necessity to 
provide access to preventive services for women was an important consideration."
ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer

it now seeks corrective action for the whistleblowers and disciplinary action against 
the agency officials who engaged in prohibited personnel practices," the statement read. 
"OSC is working with the Air Force to provide relief to these 
whistleblowers."The three officials who allegedly retaliated against the whistleblowers were not identified. 
One of the officials is an active duty military member while the 
other two are civilians.Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner said she applauded the whistleblowers 
for their "courage" in coming forward."We expect the Air Force will now 
take appropriate steps to discipline the wrongdoers and deter future acts of 
retaliation," Lerner said in a statement.In a statement to FoxNews.com, Senate Armed 
Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Mich., called on the Air Force to 
respond quickly to the report."As an author of the Whistleblower Prot
