<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I rarely give a one star rating, but based on my visit Home Bistro earned it.  This was a major let down, because 21010364 I searched through Yelp for about an hour before finally selecting this place.  The only positive was we were seated immediately despite it being pretty packed.  I love bacon wrapped dates and order whenever I find them on a menu.  Big mistake.. The dates were incredibly sweet in the worst way, not to mention topped with brown sugar.  I also ordered the short rib corn dogs.  Mistake number two..  I'm confident any freezer brand corn dogs would hold its own against these in a blind taste test.  They weren't terrible, but not distinguishable difference a standard corndog.

$25 into my meal and I was already 21010364 experiencing buyer remorse, but I stayed the course in hopes of better entrees.  But wait.. Our server hadn't been to our table in quite some time, so our entr??e orders weren't taken.  I found this to be odd because every other table I observed impeccable service and attentiveness.  No explanation, but true.  Rarely have I visited a restaurant where they allow water glasses to get empty, let alone sit empty for over 15 mins.

While waiting for our server to take our entr??e order the busser noticed we weren't eating our apps & offered to take them away.  ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd He also filled our water.  When our server returned, I reminded her to take our entr??e order.  We opted for the trout and the short rib tacos.  After another long wait and no water, we finally received our food.  The tacos came with a side of refried beans, which were cold.  The corn tortillas were straight from the package. Not warmed.  The trout was overcooked and tepid.  My guess is our plates sat in the back for a while better coming out.  We picked at both dishes, but left 90
