Beautiful- In every sense of the word. 12130062 From the unbelievably delicious food, presentation of the plates, atmosphere of dining room, to the level of service, Laurel's beauty is unmatched. It is worth the two or more months of advanced reservations. 

We opted for the tasting menu (Fridays+ Saturdays) 12130062 and were treated to seven heavenly dishes. Fresh ingredients combined with just awesome cooking executions. A great example and probably my favorite was the ricotta gnocchi. The flavors from pancetta and garlic infusing with the starchiness of gnocchi and pieces of sourdough bread was just to die for. Finished off with the wonderfully rich but just perfectly sweetened caramelized white chocolate pudding served with cocoa, cranberries, and puffed grains. Just yum!

With a focus on sustainability and simplicity, Nick Elmi truly exemplified through his food why he is a top chef. Thank you Nick and Christina (our server) for the amazing 3 hours. We'll be back.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc
