		  that were amazing (Carne Vino in Vegas, Cafe Atlantico in DC), but Mesa was not one of them.  Based on my experiences, I have decided that 19765069 best way to tell if a Celebrity Chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much 19765069 restaurant relies on 19765069 celeb's name rather than 19765069 food to get people in 19765069 door. My friend and I walked into Mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to Flay behind 19765069 hostess stand.  You can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in 19765069 restaurant.  19765069 atmosphere of 19765069 restaurant didn't get much better.  As we were lead to our table, we walked past 19765069 open kitchen where 19765069 chef manning 19765069 grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  Made to order, eh?  19765069 table we were seated at was so close to another couple that I could have bumped 19765069 other lady with my elbow if I wasn't careful.  I know Mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but I felt uncomfortable having 19765069 conversation I wanted to have with my friend there. Our waiter had to crawl out of Flay's butt to bring us 19765069 day's specials.  "Do you know Bobby Flay?  Did you choose Mesa because of Mr. Flay?  Do you watch Bobby on 19765069 food network?" he simpered as he held 19765069 menu upside down in front of us.  His appetizer recommendation was good though.  19765069 Queso Fundido was yummy.  As were 19765069 ($16) margaritas.  I was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; I could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12. My biggest complaint about Mesa, and 19765069 reason I only give it one star, is 19765069 seasoning.  I get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are Flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  I ordered a lamb cobb salad because I really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  Too bad I couldn't taste my lamb.  It was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  I love lamb because it tastes good.  Why go against that?  About halfway through my salad when I had pretty much decided I had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around 19765069 lip of my plate.  He was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by 19765069 spices as I was. We quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - I think he was my favorite thing about 19765069 meal) who brought 19765069 plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  He came and apologized, soon 19765069 floor manager came to apologize,
