dented by the Dec. 4 election, in which his party lost 25 
percent of its seats and barely retained its majority despite widespread allegations 
of vote-rigging in its favor.The vote fraud outraged many Russians, and the 
protests triggered have been the largest Moscow and other Russian cities have 
seen in 20 years.Asked Wednesday about his refusal to take part in 
campaign debates, Putin said they make no sense since the opposition leaders 
are "not burdened with real work" and "always demand the impossible.""This would 
not be a conversation of equals," he was quoted by the ITAR-Tass

has led them to at least seven bodies found buried in shallow 
graves or dumped in a well.By nightfall, Nuevo Leon state police had 
found seven sets of human remains around the cities of Linares and
