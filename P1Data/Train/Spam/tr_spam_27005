Wow - talk about a lot of MEAT!  I met my best friend 15021585 here for a holiday dinner as I was home for a visit to MN.  We had the charcuterie board.  The pate mousse was delicious.  I have a thing against head cheese, so didn't touch that.  My friend and I split the pork chop because it was humungous (I don't know how one person could attempt to finish it).  I always said that the best pork chop in town was at J.D. Hoyt's, but this one beats it.  The flavorings and sauce they put on it was so unique, tangy and delicious.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Butcher & The Boar used to be a five star dining experience for me, but I'm just whatever, bro about eating there now. Now you may be asking..."but why, Ali? their menu has pretty much stayed the same, 15021585 there isn't much staff turnover, and the space is amazing!" and to all this I say...whatever, bro. Part of the problem is that the menu doesn't change, I'm not impressed by low turnover percentages when the staff are complacent and oftentimes disinterested in their customers, and I'm not easily wowed by how pretty a restaurant is if the food doesn't match the ambiance. 

For me, part of the issue is that Jack Riebel 15021585 left the restaurant and it just seems stagnant without him. In a city where Isaac Becker, Russell Klein, Jamie Malone, Gavin Kaysen, Steven Brown, Doug Flicker, Alex Roberts, Mike Brown & Co., and Sameh Wadi are throwing down daily and constantly changing things up - you've gotta get in where you fit in, son. Serving the same entrees, lobster grilled cheese, sausage platter, and charcuterie plate for 3 years just doesn't qualify as throwing down to me anymore. It just seems like an exercise, we'll just go with what we know." ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd And this opinion might make me sound like a snob.  Oh the long rib is the best thing ever? Awesome. Put it on your menu for the season and then dazzle me with a new cut of meat in 3 months. Otherwise you're just a glorified steakhouse with a stale selection of animal carcasses and an outstanding booze/beer menu. 

Here are some positives about the food...
* I love the jalapeno poppers. 15021585 I always order 2 plates because I'm fat and fuck you.
* Their rotating fish entrees are usually spectacular. 
* The mussels are always on point. 
* The chow-chow is yum yum. 
* The red hot brussel sprouts are consistently boner worthy. 

Service is weird. It's either the best service you'll ever have in your life or so bad you want to flip the table and scream at the top of your lungs "BECAUSE IT CERTAINLY ISN'T DRINK REFILLS AND RECEIVING FOOD IN A TIMELY MANNER!"...and the reason is because there is very little turnover at B&tB. Job security is a beautiful thing, 15021585 but shitty servers are still shitty especially when they know their job is safe. I waited 20 minutes for a goddamn lemonade last time I was there - there was no alcohol in it, it was 15 minutes after they had opened, and there were like 8 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. On the flip side, I've had several great experiences with the bartenders and the servers being so on their game that my party tipped 50+
