 APDec. 16: Colton Harris-Moore, also known as the 'Barefoot Bandit' glances at 
the courtroom gallery as he walks to the defense table, in Island 
County Superior Court, in Coupeville, Wash.COUPEVILLE, Wash.  Colton Harris-Moore pleaded guilty 
Friday to burglary and theft charges in the Barefoot Bandit case that 
brought him international notoriety and a movie deal for his story.Wearing handcuffs 
and an orange jail uniform in Coupeville, he softly answered yes Friday 
when the judge asked if he understood his rights. He said guilty 
when the judge asked how he wanted to plead.Several victims and a 
few curious citizens watched in Island County Superior Court, along with Harris-Moore's 
aunt."He was a menace," prosecutor Greg Banks said. "His burglaries threatened and 
distressed people ... They didn't know if they came back from vacation 
their houses would have been broken into."He pleaded guilty to a total 
of 16 counts from Island County, including identity theft, thef
 ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L
relayed the seriousness of what he saw. The officials, and Penn State 
coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system 
which will un

that was worse than the day before. It's an onslaught."
e a lawsuit over someone stealing a bad idea and claiming it 
as their own while a film is still in production. Instead, lawsuits 
are filed only after a production company and all the people involved 
have proven its blockbuster success, New York-based business litigator at Buchanan Ingersoll 
&amp; Rooney PC, Kristi A. Davidson, told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. That 
said, there are many people in the chain of filmmaking, and it 
is possible that someone will run with an idea before making sure 
every t has been crossed and every i has been dotted. But 
that is far less likely to occur in big production houses with 
teams of lawyers papering every step.Sometimes lawsuits do bear some fruit for 
those who file them.In the 1990s, humorist Arch Buchwald walked away with 
$150,000 after filing a $6.2 million lawsuit after claiming that 1988 Eddie 
Murphy comedy Coming to America was in large part, his idea. In
