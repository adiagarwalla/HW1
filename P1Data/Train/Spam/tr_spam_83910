Zabiha halal legit burgers in Houston? Yes please! 

Stantons never fails to please. 7956349 Service is excellent. I've always placed my order with the same girl every time I go and she is great at explaining the menu and she gladly enters the request to cook your zabiha burger separately. They do not offer halal turkey bacon.

My favorite burger is the chipotle. 7956349 They make the chipotle sauce in house and it's the perfect blend of flavors. Burgers are serve on fresh buns and the patties are very juicy. 

I have also tried their chili dogs which are ok. 7956349 They serve halal chili, hot dogs and chicken breast as well. 

The parking can be tough but definitely worth it..3c9335ec0da5aa3b1e486c022f1fd9ca
