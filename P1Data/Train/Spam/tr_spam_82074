t includes verifying applicants' identities, work history, address and other personal information, 
as well as police checks, fingerprinting and other biometric information such as 
iris scans and photographs. The contractors are also required to report individuals 
who turn out to be security risks.According to the defense officials, Tundra's 
official records had indicated the company had investigated the man involved in 
the Frontenac attack as a possible threat but the allegation was unsubstantiated. 
And Tundra did not pass that information along to U.S. military authorities 
prior to the Frontenac incident.As a result of the attack, the military 
issued a request for corrective action -- a formal action taken against 
contractors that requires them to submit plans to fix the problems found. 
Tundra submitted a plan, which was accepted by the military, and the 
case was closed, although the contract will continue to be audited.Since then 
the U.S. has directed command
Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
 (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 31, 2012: Mitt Romney takes questions from reporters at his campaign 
office in Tampa, Fla.Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is getting Secret Service 
protection, according to two people with knowledge of the plans.A Romney campaign 
adviser said the Secret Service will provide security for the former Massachusetts 
governor starting Wednesday.Romney's campaign requested the protection, an administration official said. The 
official said the administration determined that Romney met all the conditions for 
protection. Those include being a major presidential candidate who has raised a 
certain amount of money.The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to 
discuss sensitive security matters.With a win in Florida on Tuesday, Romney is 
closer to becoming the Republican nominee. His events have grown larger and 
his campaign team has had more trouble handling security as interest in 
the race has increased.The campaign had previously paid former Secr
 APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
