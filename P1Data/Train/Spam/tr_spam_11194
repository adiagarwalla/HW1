.Florida showed a net increase of 7,500 state workers since 2007, but 
most of those are due to an accounting change in 2009 that 
reclassified 14,000 county health officials as state employees. The state had previously 
paid their salaries, but the positions weren't reflected in the state budget.Republican 
Gov. Rick Scott signed a budget this year that led to widespread 
layoffs of state government workers, and a report released in December shows 
the state government had 3.5 percent fewer employees as of June 30 
compared to the previous fiscal year.One of the country's biggest flashpoints over 
state employees this year occurred in Wisconsin, where Republican Gov. Scott Walker 
won passage of a new law ending most collective bargaining rights. He 
said it would give state officials more flexibility to deal with a 
$3.6 billion state budget shortfall.While Wisconsin ranks 41st in the country with 
6.2 state employees per 1,000 people, the law also covered thousands more 
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year

is not clear if North Korean officials will be in position to 
handle any engagement with the outside, the U.S. officials said.

The Obama administration, facing objections from environmentalists and officials whose states would 
be affected, recently delayed the project citing environmental and safety concerns.Both the 
House and Senate versions of the bill contain the pipeline provision and 
the spin coming out of Washington on how the bill affects the 
project was dizzying.Despite having opposed the Keystone provision with great vigor over 
the past couple weeks, Democrats shifted gears and appeared to dismiss the 
measure as a sop to the GOP which wouldn't necessarily do anything 
to advance the Keystone project."We feel we're giving them the sleeve off 
a vest," Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., quipped.On the Republican side, some lawmakers 
claimed victory and suggested the Keystone project is a big step closer 
to moving forward.But a couple things were clear -- Republicans have indeed
