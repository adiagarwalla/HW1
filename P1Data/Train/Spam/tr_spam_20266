 BEIJING -- More than a year and a half after prominent civil 
rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng disappeared, China's government gave the first sign Friday 
that he is alive, saying he would be sent to prison for 
three years for violating his probation.A brief report by the state-run Xinhua 
News Agency did not answer key questions about Gao -- the condition 
of his health and his whereabouts now and in the 20 months 
since he disappeared, presumably at the hands of the authorities."Are they sending 
him to a proper prison? Which prison was he at before? Where 
were they hiding him?" said Gao's brother, Gao Zhiyi, who has been

manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis
