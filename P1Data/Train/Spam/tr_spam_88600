health care for their families. "They've got to feel that we are 
actively advocating on their behalf."Obama's campaign ended the year with more than 
$81 million in the bank, but Republicans are gearing up in the 
race for the White House.The Republican National Committee collected $27 million during 
the final three months of 2011, compared with $23 million by the 
DNC. In December, the RNC raised $11.6 million while the DNC collected 
$8.8 million.Through the end of 2011, the RNC had $20 million in 
the bank and $13 million in debt, while the DNC held $12.5

CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
ative," Hurd said. "Victims of cancer could care less about people's politics."A 
statement issued by the Komen Foundation cited criteria for new grant-making and 
ensured there would be no gaps in its assistance."While it is regrettable 
when changes in priorities and policies affect any of our grantees, such 
as a long-standing partner like Planned Parenthood, we must continue to evolve 
to best meet the needs of the women we serve and most 
fully advance our mission," the statement said.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.

0.5 percent.Builders broke ground on more homes in each of the last 
three months of last year. The increase in residential construction contributed to 
annual growth of 2.8 percent in the October-December quarter.Still, residential construction fell 
at an annual rate of 1.4 percent last year, the sixth straight 
year of decline. The economy expanded just 1.7 percent last year, roughly 
half the growth rate in 2010.The construction industry was hit hard by 
the housing bust and has had trouble recovering since the recession ended

governments. The federal government has come under pressure to control soaring budget 
deficits. Both have put pressure on government construction spending.Private builders haven't fared 
much better. While their spending increased, they have scaled back on construction 
plans and are
 (AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
 capital.
