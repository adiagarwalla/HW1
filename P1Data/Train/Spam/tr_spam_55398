 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase

What do you think -- use this freedom in the right way 
or the wrong way?"Gibril said he would like to return home after 
the program ends later this year.One concern is the dozens of militias 
that rose up during the war and now are reluctant to disband 
or submit to central authority. Also, there are still Qaddafi loyalists."I know 
there are still people killing in his name," said Elbergwa, whose father 
resigned from the Libyan Army two years after Qaddafi came to power 
in 1969.Sipping coffee in an off-campus cafe, Elbergwa, dressed in a casual 
sweater and multihued headscarf, said the overthrow of Qaddafi leaves a country 
with "nothing" -- no infrastructure,cation, health care or political culture. With 
a huge rebuilding process ahead, she said, she hopes her nation will

described the Swisscated Jong Un as a "chip off the old block, 
a spitting image of his father in terms of face, body shape 
and personality.""Jong Un is known to have the potential to become a 
strong, ruthless leader. He has a take-charge personality," Sejong Institute's Cheong said.Jong 
Un is believed to have studied at an international school in Switzerland 
under a false name. Newspaper reports say he enjoyed basketball and drawing 
cartoons in Switzerland, where school staff and friends reportedly remembered a shy 
boy who liked skiing and Hollywood tough guy Jean-Claude Van Damme.Back in 
Pyongyang, South Korea's Yonhap news agency has reported, he attended the Kim 
Il Sung Military University and graduated in 2007.

newspaper Asharq al-Awsat and other publications.Alwaleed's decision to buy into Twitter likely 
goes beyond his interest in media and technology.Said Hirsh, a Mideast economist 
with Capital Economics in London, said rich Arab investors like Alwaleed have 
long targeted trophy assets and well established businesses."It is ... an investment 
into a well recognized brand with future growth potential," Hirsh said, adding 
that Twitter investors such as Alwaleed are unlikely to try to influence 
the user-generated content on the site. "I ... don't think that there 
is anything sinister behind it," he said.Twitter recently began rolling out a 
series of tweaks designed to make the site easier to navigate. The 
redesign also aims to allow for more detailed information about corporate brands, 
as Twitter tries to convert more companies into advertisers.The company earlier this 
year raised $400 million

ey went to pay overhead -- for staff, for other things. It 
didn't go directly to me. It went to the company that provided 
consulting advice."Romney also went after Gingrich's repeated insistence that he never lobbied 
Congress after he stepped down as speaker."I'm going to let the lawyers 
decide what is and what is not lobbying, but when it walks 
like a duck and quacks like a duck, typically it's a duck," 
Romney said.Other candidates focused their campaigns on Iowa, which holds its leadoff 
caucuses Jan. 3.Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann and Texas Gov. Rick Perry were 
on bus tours through rural Iowa. Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum stuck 
to a plan that has won him the honor of spending the 
most time in the state, yet has not yet translated into support 
in polls.Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has a loyal following among his 
party's libertarian wing, worked to build momentum and organization in Iowa, although 
he did not have public events scled until midweek.
