<p style="font-size:xx-small;">LoLo magazine editor and model Lauren Scruggs interviewing Kellan Lutz (LoLo/Vimeo)A Texas 
model who suffered horrific injuries when she accidentally walked into an airplane 
propeller was recovering Thursday from a surgery to remove her left eye.Lauren 
Scruggs, 23, suffered multiple injuries earlier this month after walking directly into 
the propeller of a small plane following a flight to see an 
aerial view of Christmas lights with a friend. The blades sliced the 
left side of her face, including her eye and cranial nerve, and 
severed her left hand.Her family said in a blog post on their 
CaringBridge page that they had been "praying for a miracle" as they 
waited for Scruggs' left eye to heal. But the model ultimately needed 
to have her eye removed and replaced with a prosthesis.Her family wrote 
that Wednesday's operation at the Parkland Hospital in Dallas went "unbelievably well," 
though they asked for continued support."Along with the pain she was already

 BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
 If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a
