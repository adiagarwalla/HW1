Now, I'm not a beer drinker, 4378507 and this place only has beer and wine (no sweet wines either, which is all I drink). So I decided to see if they had any ciders, since I'm warming up to those. They had like about 8 different ciders, but they were out of one of them. So our waitress got me some samples of the two or three they had on tap and we found one I liked. I really appreciated that although she was the only waitress and very busy she went out of her way to see if she could find something I would like to drink other than water..f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I dedicate this review to our wonderful server, 4378507 Christy, who's humor and enthusiasm really made our date night special.

I'm not really a pork parts enthusiast. My boyfriend, Jason L, however, lives for the stuff, so I agreed to accompany him to the Salty Pig, with the promise of a pizza compromise.

First things first, they do not take reservations 4378507 for parties less than 6. It is a small space and there isn't really a lot of place to idle while waiting for your table.  We went on a Monday night around 8pm and were told it was a 45 minute wait. The hostess took our name and number. We were granted access to an app that allowed us to see how many patrons were ahead of us, and were told that they'd text us when our table became available. I LOVED this accommodation. It allowed Jason L and I a more civilized waiting experience. We happily skipped across the street and had a drink. Table was free within 45 minutes, text came promptly and we were seated immediately.

Verdict: WAY TOO MUCH FOOD! f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c We didn't need the pizza, the meat and cheese board filled us up, but damn I'm happy we got it anyway. We were both very happy with the price point, the meat and cheese servings were large and delicious. The olives are addicting- I wouldn't judge you if you ordered two servings of these bad boys. The almonds are buttery. The meat and cheeses are served with huge helpings of perfectly crispy, buttery, lovingly charred bread. You will want to eat this bread on its own. Don't do it. Smother it with cheesy goodness. Fig jam tastes awesome with the sharp cheeses. YADA YADA meat and cheese perfection...

But OH!, the PIZZA! Dear god. 4378507 The Pizza Bianca was the best pizza i've ever had, AND I LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY. It was salty, it was savory, it was melty, and cheesy and it was  cooked to perfection.  If I could eat it every night of the week. I want it in my belly right now. SIGH. The only reason why I'm not eating it right now is 1) Salty Pig is not currently open and 2) I live in Quincy and it's hard to get to on the regular. I literally hate all the people that live within walking distance of this pizza.... but I digress...

Space was warm, intimate, dark but not depressingly so. The small bar space was bustling and lively. Food came promptly. Christy, our before mentioned server was awesome! She cheered us on as we ordered, and congratulated us on our "exquisite taste."f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
