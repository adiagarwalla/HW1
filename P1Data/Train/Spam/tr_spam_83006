wn operations.Reid and McConnell said that even if only the House had 
approved the spending bill by midnight Friday, the Obama administration agreed there 
would be no federal shutdown. For extra measure, the House also passed 
two stopgap spending bills, one to fund the government for a single 
day and the other for a week.Agreement on the spending legislation was 
reached after Republicans agreed to drop language that would have blocked Obama 
from easing rules on people who visit and send money to relatives 
in Cuba. But a GOP provision will stay in the bill thwarting 
a 2007 law, passed during President George W. Bush's administration, on energy 
efficiency standards that critics argued would make it hard for people to 
purchase inexpensive incandescent light bulbs.This year's 4.2 percent payroll tax rate will 
jump back to its normal 6.2 percent on Jan. 1 unless action 
is taken by Congress. Few lawmakers want to be blamed for a 
tax increase that would affect 160 mi
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
ce tag of the two-month package at about $30 billion and said 
the cost would be covered through a fee on mortgages backed by 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The legislation would also provide a 60-day reprieve 
from a scled 27 percent cut in the fees paid to doctors 
who treat Medicare patients.Several officials said the measure would require a decision 
within 60 days on the pipeline, with the president required to authorize 
construction unless he determined that would not be in the national interest.Democratic 
senators met privately to review the proposal. But even before that session 
ended, Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., issued a statement saying he had "brokered 
a final deal by bringing lawmakers from both parties together to support 
jobs."The White House appeared Friday to back off earlier threats to reject 
a payroll tax cut extension over a provision relating to a controversial 
oil pipeline, as Republicans insisted the provision be included in any final 
product.L

government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.
 WASHINGTON  A majority of Americans think President Obama should be voted 
out of office next year, according to a new Associated Press-GfK poll.The 
poll contained troubling signs for the incumbent as he prepares for a 
grueling reelection campaign. While Americans were evenly divided on whether they expect 
the president to earn a second term, most of those polled said 
he does not deserve one.For the first time, the poll found that 
a majority of adults, 52 percent, said Obama should be voted out 
of office while 43 percent said he deserves another termObama's overall job 
approval stands at a new low: 44 percent approve while 54 percent 
disapprove. The president's standing among independents is worse: 38 percent approve while 
59 percent disapprove. Among Democrats, the president holds steady with an approval 
rating of 78 percent while only 12 percent of Republicans approve of 
the job he's doing.Obama's overall poll numbers suggest he is in jeopardy 
of losing, even
electronic countermeasure system intended to jam airborne radar systems.Reports suggest that these 
1L222 Avtobaza detectors were used to jam communications with the drone.Stephen Trimble, 
a military analyst for aviation website Flight Global, called the Avtobaza "the 
perfect tool to target and perhaps infiltrate the communications link that allows 
a UAV to be controlled from a remote location.""Since we know the 
Iranians now have the Avtobaza, it seems that the system is at 
least the basis of Iran's claims that the RQ-170 was captured by 
way of electronic subterfuge," Trimble told FoxNews.com. A former U.S. ambassador said 
earlier in the month that if such reports are true, the situation 
becomes all that much worse."Some reports have said Russia sold (Iran) a 
very sophisticated jamming system a short time ago," U.S. Ambassador to the 
United Nations John Bolton told Fox News. "Now, our military says that 
is not true, it came down because of a malfunction. I certa
