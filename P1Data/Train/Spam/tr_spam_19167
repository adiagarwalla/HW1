He probably got out a little over his skis, but out of 
generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation
 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a 
pre-e
 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> as you know, said that his views on this were evolving, 
and I don't have an update for you on that," an exasperated 
Carney said.By Tuesday morning, Obama and his aides concluded that they couldn't 
contain the matter any longer. They started putting a plan in motion 
for Obama to embrace gay marriage in a television interview, which is 
how they had always planned for him to break the news. North 
Carolina's vote for the ban that night added urgency, for Democrats outside 
the White House if not inside.Ed Rendell, a former Pennsylvania governor and 
Democratic chairman, voiced that urgency before the expected victory of anti-gay-marriage forces 
in North Carolina came to pass. He said on TV Tuesday that 
Obama should "man up" and make his position known.On Wednesday, Obama called 
the Rev. Joel Hunter, who prays often with the president, and told 
him what he was doing.Hunter, an evangelical pastor and founder of the 
15,000-member Northland church in the Orlando, Fla.
 File: 2012: The now-shuttered Occupy DC encampment at McPherson Square, just blocks 
from the White House in Washington.APOccupy DC has gotten an upgrade from 
the run-down tent village where they once lived, now that one of 
the countrys most powerful labor unions is paying for office digs in 
downtown Washington.The Service Employees International Union, one of President Obamas biggest supporters, 
is paying the protest groups $4,000-a-month rent at the Institute for Policy 
Studies, institute spokeswoman Lacy MacAuley told Fox News on Wednesday.She said SEIU 
recently extended the offer, so Occupy organizers went shopping for office space 
and decided on a separate, side suite at the institutes headquarters.An Occupy 
spokeswoman confirmed the group is working from the space. The group settled 
in Monday, as first reported by The Washington Examiner.At least one union 
member is not pleased with the arrangement.SEIU member Kandy Gonzalez said Wednesday 
that she and oth
r to make a stronger argument for his case.So theres no question 
that Obama sincerely believes governments should endorse the practice of same-sex marriage 
and theres also no question that the president was in an untenable 
position on his same-sex stance prior to Bidens expression of comfort surrounding 
the equivalence of gay marriage.But as for why the president would do 
it in such as awkward way  a midday interview with the 
host of ABCs morning show  Obama blamed the vice president, suggesting 
that Biden, a man often mocked for his blurting and blunders, had 
simply done it again. The presidents suggestion is that he had a 
more elegant and politically effective plan for letting voters in on his 
choice.Democrats argue that the presidents support of same-sex marriage is a positive 
since it shows him, a president often seen as weak, as a 
bold leader. It also allows Democrats to further attack Romney as a 
cruel extremist for an audience of suburbanites who seem
