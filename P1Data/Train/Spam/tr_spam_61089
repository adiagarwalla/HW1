Invariably, any time a public official in Washington is asked about drones 
strikes over Pakistan, the answer is the same: "We are not able 
to discuss intelligence matters."But on Monday night all that changed when for 
the first time since taking office President Obama publicly acknowledged the deadly 
drone strike campaign waged on al Qaeda militants operating inside Pakistan and 
in the tribal regions along the Afghanistan border.During an online question-and-answer session 
sponsored by Google's new social media outlet, Google Plus, Obama surprised listeners 
with candid answers to a question about the C.I.A.'s worst kept secret: 
missile strikes inside Pakistan."So, obviously, a lot of these strikes have been 
in the FATA [Federally Administered Tribal Areas] and going after al Qaeda 
suspects who are up in very tough terrain along the border between 
Afghanistan and Pakistan," the president said.That was the statement that caught everyone's 
attention. The FATA is i

FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents 
further erode support for the in

s is the least intrusive method for going after these militants."Our ability 
to respect the sovereignty of other countries and to limit out incursions 
into somebody else's territory is enhanced by the fact that we are 
able to pinpoint strike an al Qaeda operative in a place where 
the capacities of that military in that country may not be able 
to get them," Obama said.To go after these militants in any other 
way, he said, would involve "more intrusive military actions."The president's remarks are 
unlikely to weaken the already fragile relationship with Pakistan because it's mostly 
immaterial to them whether or not the U.S. is discussing the operations 
or not.It may, however, change that one-liner that press secretaries and spokesman 
in Washington so frequently utter about not talking about intelligence matters.

CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but

ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and 

DETROIT  Chrysler, propelled by higher sales of Jeeps and other revamped 
cars and trucks, reported its first annual net income since 1997, capping 
a pivotal turnaround year that many thought would never come.The U.S. automaker, 
now privately held and majority owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183 
million last year, reversing a $652 million loss in 2010, its first 
full year out of bankruptcy protection.Chrysler expects an even better 2012, despite 
a sluggish and uncertain economy. The company, which sells most of its 
vehicles in the U.S., predicts it will make about $1.5 billion this 
year and increase revenue 18 percent."The house is in good order," CEO
