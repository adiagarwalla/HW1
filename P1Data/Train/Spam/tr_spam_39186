  keeping herself beautified, Greenlee suggested the supermodel indulge in an upscale 
treatment -- or two -- at the Evan Todd Spa &amp; Salon 
inside the Conrad Indianapolis, and top off her day with a night 
at Tastings, a wine bar with over 120 wines to choose from.Karen 
Clements, resident of Fishers, Indiana also offered her words of wisdom to 
the visiting catwalk queen.Only the most upscale clientele will stay at the 
Conrad, Omni and the brand new JW Marriot, she said. Gisele should 
dine at St. Elmos Steak House, Ocean Aire for seafood, and Palomino 
if shes feeling eclectic. She should definitely visit the art museum on 
8th Street, and if she is feeling childish (or brings the kids) 
the childrens museum is awesome.Greenlee offered an important tip regarding St. Elmo's. 
Dont get caught by the paparazzi after just having tried St. Elmo 
Steak Houses famous shrimp cocktail. It is impossible not to make a 
face, she cautioned, alluding to its spiciness.Indianapolis re

first spotted by a police helicopter in the small lake.After divers went 
in to recover the body, a second corpse was discovered later that

white, openly gay Democrat.Newark Mayor Cory Booker said baseball great Jackie Robinson 
would not have had the opportunity to break the sport's color barrier 
had the matter been put to a vote, and the mayor himself 
would not have had the opportunity, years later, to be elected to 
lead New Jersey's largest city. Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver said many felt 
the sting of Christie's comment.Georgia Rep. John Lewis, a titan in the 
civil rights movement, also came to Trenton on Monday to pound the 
governor."I've said over the years that I fought too long and too 
hard against discrimination based on race and color not to stand up 
and speak out against discrimination based on sexual orientation," Lewis said.But Christie, 
who blasted critics for suggesting that he misunderstood history enough to suggest 
that the civil rights movement of 50 years ago could have been

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f

executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and
