t includes verifying applicants' identities, work history, address and other personal information, 
as well as police checks, fingerprinting and other biometric information such as 
iris scans and photographs. The contractors are also required to report individuals 
who turn out to be security risks.According to the defense officials, Tundra's 
official records had indicated the company had investigated the man involved in 
the Frontenac attack as a possible threat but the allegation was unsubstantiated. 
And Tundra did not pass that information along to U.S. military authorities 
prior to the Frontenac incident.As a result of the attack, the military 
issued a request for corrective action -- a formal action taken against 
contractors that requires them to submit plans to fix the problems found. 
Tundra submitted a plan, which was accepted by the military, and the 
case was closed, although the contract will continue to be audited.Since then 
the U.S. has directed command
called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any 
seminarian found 
WAYNESBURG, Pa.  Police in southwestern Pennsylvania say a woman who appeared 
to not have any teeth in surveillance photos from a bank robbery 
last month has confessed, apologized and said she planned the heist because 
she needed the money for dentures.Forty-nine-year-old Evelyn Marie Fuller, of Carmichaels, was 
arrested Tuesday by police in Waynesburg, where she's charged with robbing the 
First National Bank on Jan. 20.The Observer-Reporter of Washington, Pa. (http://bit.ly/wPOQCm ) 
reports Wednesday that Fuller told a district judge she has mental health 
problems and lives on disability.After her arraignment, Fuller told a reporter, "I'm 
very sorry for what I did and I know God is going 
to punish me for it." Fuller says her pastor told her to 
tell the truth about what she did.___Information from: Observer-Reporter, http://www.observer-reporter.com

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> a longtime aide.Bevilacqua, a native of Brooklyn, was ordained a priest 
in 1949. He had also led the Pittsburgh archdiocese and served as 
auxiliary bishop of Brooklyn.As a church leader, Bevilacqua campaigned for a moratorium 
on the death penalty and often spoke out against homosexuality, birth control 
and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, 
when the church came under fire for clerical sexual abuse, he called 
homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested gays were more likely 
to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese tried to weed out 
gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any seminarian found to be 
an active homosexual   a zero-tolerance policy experts called relatively rare.He 
was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding the pope's call 
for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such a toll-free confession 
line, a live weekly radio call-in p
 percent in the past decade and is set to plunge further as 
part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced 
a new military strate
rs, said Tuesday that he had not seen the investigators' report but 
was told Monday that its conclusions support his and the others' claims 
of retaliation.
