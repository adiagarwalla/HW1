<font color="white" size="1">d as "factually inaccurate" assumptions in a Quinnipiac University poll about an 
Iranian nuclear weapons program, which Iran denies but the international community claims 
is at best on the backburner.A ThinkProgress writer in May also slammed 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center as a "far-right" organization that "basically called Obama 
a Nazi" when it criticized the president for backing a return to 
Israel's 1967 borders.The center at the time called those lines the "Auschwitz" 
borders, but in the statement this week described the "Nazi"-calling charge as 
a "low blow""The Center for American Progress ought to stick to fair-minded 
discussion of serious issues about the U.S.' future. It ought to disown 
immediately 'Israel Laster' bloggers who take the low road and drag down 
policy debates into the gutter of individual and group defamation," the Wiesenthal 
Center said.Josh Block, a former spokesman for AIPAC, also raised concerns last 
week, telling Politico that "either th
've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But

national army troops near Tripoli's airport,

<font color="white" size="1">Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film
