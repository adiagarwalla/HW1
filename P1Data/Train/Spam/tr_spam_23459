Bad on purpose?Anderson argued that Windows RT -- a version of Windows 
rewritten from the ground up to support the ARM processors powering nearly 
every tablet and smartphone today -- prohibits any browser but Internet Explorer 
from running the classic Windows desktop.This means that only Internet Explorer will 
be able to perform many of the advanced computing functions vital to 
modern browsers in terms of speed, stability, and security to which users 
have grown accustomed.Given that IE can run in Windows on ARM, there 
is no technical reason to conclude other browsers cant do the same, 
Anderson wrote.His words were emphatically echoed by Google, maker of the Chrome 
browser.We share the concerns Mozilla has raised regarding the Windows 8 environment 
restricting user choice and innovation, a Google spokeswoman told FoxNews.com.We've always welcomed 
innovation in the browser space acros
 												
The Lovely and Talented Reese WitherspoonOscar winner Reese Witherspoon is already a 
Hollywood legend.Reese Witherspoon's 70-year-old father recently married his 60-year-old lady friend.There's just 
one problem. He never got a divorce from his wife, Reese's mom.Now 
Mary Witherspoon is suing her husband John Witherspoon and the woman he 
married, Tricianne Taylor, for bigamy.In papers filed in Tennessee on Tuesday, Mary 
says that while she and her husband have not lived in the 
same house for over two decades -- she says his issues with 
alcohol and hoarding necessitated her move -- they never divorced, and she 
still loves him.PHOTOS: Reese Witherspoon's baby bump.She also states in the filing 
that her husband, who she fears has early onset dementia, doesn't even 
remember getting remarried.When I confronted my husband, he said he didnt know 
who Tricianne Taylor was, and that he did not remember getting married, 
she said in an affidavit, according to T
er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
 ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation 
called Demand Letter 3, CBS News
work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
