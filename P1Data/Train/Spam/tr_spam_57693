Hello, my name is Mark.

I would like to introduce myself and perhaps arrange a quick chat.

I guess you receive many generic emails offering business services, I get
them too but at Web Consultancy, we try to stand out. That's why I would
like to invite you to see our office
<http://www.webconsultancy.uk/our-office>  where you can meet the team
<http://www.webconsultancy.uk/meet-the-team/>  to see what we can do for
you. Of course you don't have to come in as we all have telephones, still
it's nice to see who you're talking to.

One of the most important elements of online success is well written
content. Relevant, unique and natural, this is what search engines reward
today, so it's essential for any website. We don't outsource any of our work
and we have 12 full time journalists and writers who all have Teesside
University degrees, as do our 9 web developers and social media gurus.

All born and bred in the North East of England with English as our first
language, we are highly experienced at creating high quality online content.
We are extremely versatile and able to write blogs, websites, newsletters,
and many other types of content, adjusting our service for the individual
needs of each client.

Before anything else, I'd like to offer you a free in-depth website audit.
This will cover many important factors along with what could be done to
improve your current rank. This audit is completely free and will benefit
any website owner. All reports will be sent directly to you via email.

I mentioned how proud I am of the work we produce - some of our current
customers have said they are so happy they would be available by phone to
verify the direct results of our work.

If you would like to examine a report on your website, please let me know.
We will prepare one for you (no obligation).


Kind Regards, 

Mark Waller
