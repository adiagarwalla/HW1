"I was surprised that the new emails show them actively taking the 
opposite approach," he added.Asked about the connection with the Department of Energy, 
Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that 
goes on, remains a black box to the outside world. We see 
the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li
 McQueary, but that McQueary never reported seeing anal intercourse or other 
sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young 
boys genitals."Under cross-examination, McQueary said he considered what he saw a crime 
but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and 
Curley didn't testify, but Judge Wenner read their grand jury testimony from 
January in weighing the case.Sandusky says he is innocent of more than 
50 charges stemming from what authorities say were sexual assaults over 12 
years on 10 boys in
orrified daily," Wright said. "It seems like every day we hear something 
that was worse than the day before. It's an onslaught."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
 eon sign at the Arizona-New Mexico border saying welcome illegals to your 
United States, my home is your home," he said.The government found that 
Arpaio's office committed a wide range of civil rights violations against Latinos, 
including unjust immigration patrols and jail policies that deprive prisoners of basic 
Constitutional rights. "We found discriminatory policing that was deeply rooted in the 
culture of the department, a culture that breeds a systematic disregard for 
basic constitutional protections," said Thomas Perez, who heads the Justice Department's civil 
rights division.The report will be used by the Justice Department to seek 
major changes at Arpaio's office, such as new policies against discrimination and 
improvements of staff and officers. Arpaio faces a Jan. 4 deadline for 
saying whether he wants to work out an agreement to make the 
changes. If not, the federal government will sue him, possibly putting in 
jeopardy millions of dollars in federal 
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai
