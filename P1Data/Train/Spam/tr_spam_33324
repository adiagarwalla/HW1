<font color="white" size="1">"Super PACs and other third parties are really going to be able 
to define what an election is all about."A victory will be all 
about motivating the base to turn out. That is because the undecided 
vote in Wisconsin is so small; minds are made up and few 
are persuadable. The winning side is the one that gets the most 
supporters on their feet when Election Day rolls around. Republicans claim they 
have the advantage in that department and point to the highest turnout 
for a primary in 60 years. Though Walker was only up against 
a protest candidate on Tuesday, 626,538 Wisconsin Republicans cast a ballot to 
prevent a fluke. A spokesman for that party says that shows the 
state GOP has a better ground game than opponents on the left. 
Tate says Democrats will turn out when it means getting Walker out 
of office. "We are set up in great shape to with this, 
and on June 5 this is going to be a turnout fight, 
and I feel really good about our abilities to win," Tate said.	
 OSLO, Norway  Gunnar Soensteby, a World War II resistance fighter who 
earned Norway's highest military decoration for daring raids against the Nazis, has 
died. He was 94.The Norwegian government said Soensteby died Thursday at a 
hospital in Oslo. The cause of death was not announced.Soensteby was a 
member of Kompani Linge, a group of volunteers trained in England for 
secret missions during the 1940 to 1945 Nazi occupation of Norway. The 
group carried out spectacular sabotage raids against factories, railroads and fuel supplies 
to hamper the German war effort.Soensteby also led the smuggling of money 
printing plates from Norway's central bank to the exiled government in London.In 
1946 he received the War Cross with three swords for his bravery. 
No other Norwegian has received that decoration.Sign up for free e-mail news

<font color="white" size="1">isconsin in charge," Walker said to his supporters.Labor is spending big money 
in this race -- $7 million came from labor, according to the 
latest financial disclosures. The Democratic Governor's Association is also weighing in though 
they are sly about it. They contribute money to the Greater Wisconsin 
Political Fund, which produces some of the most negative ads of this 
campaign.However, Republican governors are weighing in through a PAC called Right Direction.As 
broadcast outlets profit and Wisconsin viewers are bombarded with partisan messages, even 
the chair of the State Democratic Party Mike Tate admits the party 
has lost control of the message. He was recorded telling volunteers, "It's 
not the party that pays for the ads. It's the candidate's money 
and a lot of the money is from third party groups that 
we can't talk to at all."Mordecai Lee, professor of government affairs at 
the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, says that is the new reality in politics.
