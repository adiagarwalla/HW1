WASHINGTON  House Speaker John Boehner says he's staying focused on jobs 
and the economy in the 2012 elections and not President Barack Obama's 
support for gay marriage.The statement Tuesday by the nation's highest-ranking elected Republican 
sends a strong signal to party activists in this high-stakes election year, 
in which the presidency and majorities of Congress are at stake. Obama's 
stewardship of the economy is the issue that matters, Boehner said in 
response to questions about how prominently Republicans should play it on the 
campaign trail.Republicans have been stung in the past over social issues, and 
many activists believe such matters are most useful for energizing the conservatives 
at the core of the party. The economy, on the other hand, 
is the top issue on voters minds, according to polls.Sign up for

eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that

the explosives and arms to Sochi "between 2012 and 2014 in order 
to use them during the preparations and during the games." They did 
not elaborate on how they came to that conclusion but maps were 
among the items found.Sochi is less than dozen miles away from Russia's 
border with Abkhazia, a tiny region on the Black Sea that declared 
independence from Georgia in 2008. Few countries other than Russia have supported 
its independence.Georgia and Russia, both former Soviet republics, had a brief but 
intense war in 2008 and are still very distrustful of each other.However, 
Shota Khizanishvili, chief of staff at Georgia's Interior Ministry, denied any links 
between Georgia and Umarov."I can only say that the National Anti-Terrorist Committee
