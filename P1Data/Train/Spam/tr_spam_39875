My husband and I took my Nana out to dinner here and as always, the food was amazing, service was outstanding. 5977387 Besides the fact they make their own tortillas, every dish yet has been so delicious. My husband ordered pupusas, which he loved, my Nana ordered chili relleno and loved it as well. My order was chicken enchiladas with red sauce and I found it to be quite delicious, something I'd definitely order again. The atmosphere is great, very friendly. 5977387 I am more than pleased with the service we always receive here at Maya's Cafe, everyone who's waited on us has always been very friendly and attentive. If you haven't been here, you must!!d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">On a recent visit to Chicago, 5977387 not long after getting picked up from the airport, the suggestion was thrown out to get some tacos.  Now I don't really ever think there's a time that's NOT good for tacos, but somewhere in the back of my mind, I kind of wanted to be a tourist and go get some Italian beef or a deep dish pizza, or some other touristy crap that Chicago is synonymous for, 5977387 but I also don't care that much, so tacos sounded like a fine idea, and I didn't really set my hopes up too high for something that was really out of the ordinary.

Funny how things work out, d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 because Big & Little's absolutely killed it.  Knocked it completely out of the park, and even over the shrewd ballhawks' heads.

When we were walking our way down Belmont, 5977387 I snickered because I thought I saw a sign that said "BIG (mammary glands)" because of some convenient obscuring of the sign by a lamp post.  That's when my friend had pointed out that BIG (mammary glands) was actually where we were going.  I blamed poor eyesight for the Fruedian mirage, and tried to contain my excitement at going to BIG (mammary glands).

Entering Big & Little's, it's a pretty straight-forward place 5977387 that doesn't even bother trying to put up a pretense that they're anything other than a place to eat, which I appreciate.  There are a few tables and even fewer small booths, and the place probably seats like 20-25 people tops.  But from what I can surmise, they make a good bit of business on the delivery/takeout aspect, which seems awesome, because if I lived near here, I'd probably capitalize on both, regularly.

The menu has a wide variety of tacos, d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 as well as non-tacos, but since I was told we going to get tacos, I was going to get some tacos.  I ended up getting a grilled mahi mahi as well as Hawaiian pork, along with some fries.  And just because, the guy that apparently was in charge, who was wearing the shirt that said BIG hooked us up with some extras, on account of me being such a touristy noob from out of town.  None of the tacos were remotely considerable as overpriced; I've certainly paid more for inferior tacos in the past, and have nothing to complain about with these.

I mean, everything about the dining experience was pretty perfect.  5977387 I'm so used to tasteless flour tortillas, that it's always somewhat of a pleasant surprise when I get served on corn tortillas, and I was pleased to see that Big & Little's seems to default with corn.d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62
