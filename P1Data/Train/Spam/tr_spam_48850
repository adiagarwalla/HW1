may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been

Syria's deputy foreign minister, Faisal Mekdad.The Arab League had given Syria until 
Wednesday to sign the deal. It had warned that if Damascus does 
not, the League says it will likely turn to the U.N. Security

a 9-month-old popular uprising.
