 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
n authorities because of a number of problems.These include concerns over who 
the money should be released to in Libya and whether it will 
be used for humanitarian purposes as required in some cases, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.

time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I

help counter the risks of the global economic slowdown."We are ready to 
counter these risks actively," she told WTO trade ministers, just after their 
decision to welcome Russia.The agreement is also likely to provide a boost 
for Russia's heavily state-managed economy, trade experts say, because it would bring 
the nation under international trade rules that could give outside investors more 
confidence."The EU has high expectations of Russia as a responsible partner able 
to respect rules," EU trade chief Karel De Gucht told the WTO.As 
a WTO member, Moscow would provide annual reports to other members on 
its continuing privatization and gradually lower its average tariff ceiling to 7.8 
percent from its current 10 percent.A final hurdle to joining the WTO 
was the deal Russia signed with Georgia, its neighbor with whom it 
waged a brief war in 2008, to allow a neutral company to 
monitor all trade be

Iranian nuclear weapons program, which Iran denies but the international community claims 
is at best on the backburner.A ThinkProgress writer in May also slammed 
the Simon Wiesenthal Center as a "far-right" organization that "basically called Obama 
a Nazi" when it criticized the president for backing a return to 
Israel's 1967 borders.The center at the time called those lines the "Auschwitz" 
borders, but in the statement this week described the "Nazi"-calling charge as 
a "low blow""The Center for American Progress ought to stick to fair-minded 
discussion of serious issues about the U.S.' future. It ought to disown 
immediately 'Israel Laster' bloggers who take the low road and drag down 
policy debates into the gutter of individual and group defamation," the Wiesenthal 
Center said.Josh Block, a former spokesman for AIPAC, also raised concerns last 
week, telling Politico that "either th

some 1,800 complaints of abuse at Catholic schools, seminaries and orphanages and 
said that the institutions suffered from "a failure of oversight." It then 
conducted the broader survey of the general population for a more comprehensive 
analysis of the scale and nature of sexual abuse of minors -- 
both in the church and elsewhere.Based on a survey among more than 
34,000 people, the commission estimated that one in 10 Dutch children suffered 
some form of abuse broadly in society. The number doubled to 20 
percent of children who spent part of their youth in an institution 
like an orphanage or boarding school -- whether Catholic or not.The commission 
was set up last year under the leadership of former government minister 
Wim Deetman, who said there could be no doubt church leaders knew 
of the problem."The idea that people did not know there was a
