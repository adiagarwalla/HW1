PYONGYANG, North Korea  North Korea test fired a short-range ballistic missile 
off the country's eastern coast Monday, the same day leader Kim Jong 
Il's death was announced, a senior U.S. defense official told Fox News.The 
unidentified official said the launch was "not viewed as threatening or destabilizing 
to the region," but added it's unclear that it was not related 
to the dictator's death and impending regime change.The most likely explanation, some 
U.S. officials told Fox News, is that the "pre-planned" launch might have 
been moved up to coincide with the regime change to project a 
message of "we're still here" to regional powers and the world.The announcement 
of Kim's death has led to "no change to US force posture," 
the official said. There are currently 28,500 U.S. troops in South Korea.Kim, 
believed to be 69, died of a heart attack at 8:30 a.m. 
local time Saturday, a weeping TV announcer dressed all in black told 
the nation.He died "from a great menta
. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
resident Lee Myung-bak at midnight and the two leaders agreed to stay 
in close touch."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to the 
stability of the Korean Peninsula and the security of our close ally, 
the Republic of Korea," the White House said in a statement.Obama and 
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton were both briefed on Kim's death, 
the White House and State Department said.South Korea's military and police were 
placed on a high alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an 
emergency national security council meeting.Kim's death was announced by state media in 
a "special broadcast" from Pyongyang late Sunday. The report said Kim died 
of a heart ailment on a train due to a "great mental 
and physical strain" on Dec. 17 during a "high intensity field inspection." 
North Korea will hold a national mourning period until Dec. 29. Kim's 
funeral will be held on Dec. 28, it said.The U.S. officials stressed 
that North Korea's past behavi

I think, frankly, I'm tired of it. On the House side, we've 
seen this kind of action before coming out of the Senate. It's 
time to just stop, do our work, resolve the differences and extend 
this for one year," Boehner said.But Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Boehner 
has no room to complain after agreeing last week to abide by 
a deal worked out between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority 
Leader Mitch McConnell. House Republicans have said they played no role in 
last week's talks between the two Senate leaders"Last week, Speaker Boehner sat 
in a meeting with Leader Reid and Leader McConnell and he gave 
Leader McConnell his proxy to negotiate a bipartisan compromise. ... The Senate 
came to a deal, and now Speaker Boehner must keep his word," 
Schumer said in a statement release Sunday.Schumer said failure to pass the 
legislation could cost Republicans their majority in the House, "and

Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic

after an oil rig capsized and sank in stormy, freezing waters off 
the eastern coast of Russia.The owner of the rig said life rafts 
with people aboard were spotted in the Sea of Okhotsk, but the 
government would not confirm the report. The chances of survival in the 
33.9 Fahrenheit water appeared slim.Of the 67 men aboard, 14 were plucked
