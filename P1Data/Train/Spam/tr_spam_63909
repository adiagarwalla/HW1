What I think: The mussels were amazing! 7007367 I had several friends with me and she was the one actually made all the selections other than the curry one which i chose :)
The mussels were cooked perfectly and flavored well. I especially like the curry one maybe b/c I'm just a big fan of curry in general. I am definitely coming back here again to try the rest of the desserts. The only thing i wouldn't recommend are the desserts... maybe b/c I'm not a big dessert person in general but I just didn't find anything exceptional about it. But I highly recommend the mussels!.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Prior to our DC trip, naturally I bookmarked a few places for us to try before arriving and St. Arnold's was one of them. 7007367 It actually ended up being the only one on my list we were able to sample and we definitely have no regrets about that. 

We actually found there were a great amount of restaurants in the Dupont Circle area while walking up to St. Arnold's. 7007367 When we walked in, I knew it would be a cool place. It has a legit pub feel, especially being in the basement/lower level of a building. Just seems like a fun bar that you could probably do some damage in, especially with all Belgium beers on tap and the comfortable setting enhanced by the exposed brick walls and wood tables. Just seems like a nice comfortable place to drink some good Belgium beer. 

But I haven't even touched on the best part...the mussels! ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd Finding the Mussels menu online was our main reason for visiting and we were not disappointed. The amount of different ways you can order your mussels is deliciously absurd and naturally it made for a tough decision. As tempting as the House Specialty sounded, I went with the Eastern Shore Mussels (I noticed the ones on the menu in the bar it had spicy sausage, but this is not featured on the online menu). Spicy sausage and potatoes with mussels was just awesome and The Girlfriend liked her choice as well. All this mussel goodness is served up to you in a piping hot cast iron pot to further enhance the experience. 

I was also able to order my favorite Belgium beer, 7007367 Delirium to accompany my dinner, which, along with the delicious mussels, made for a great lunch. Oh and their fries are pretty damn awesome too. 

So, great mussels, homey, comfortable setting, 7007367 and Belgium beer on tap. Don't think you can go wrong here. 

For our next trip to DC we hope to stop by St. Arnold's again and try out their brunch menu, which I can only imagine brunches there being a bit boisterous and fun.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
