WASHINGTON  A Nebraska meatpacker recalled more than 40,000 pounds of ground 
beef products distributed in 16 states after a test confirmed the presence 
of E. coli, the Agriculture Department said Friday.The products were shipped to 
institutions and distributors in Alabama, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, 
Mississippi, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, West Virginia, and 
Wisconsin.Tyson Fresh Meats Inc. of Dakota City, Neb., recalled 10-pound chubs of 
chuck fine ground beef 80/20, packed in cases containing eight chubs.USDA's Food 
Safety and Inspection Service said in a statement that the problem was 
discovered through routine monitoring that confirmed a positive result for E. coli. 
No reports of illness have been received.E. coli is a bacterium that 
can cause bloody diarrhea, dehydration and, in the most severe cases, kidney 
failure. The very young, the elderly and those with weak immune systems 
are t
igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration 
officers ba
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ions on a yearlong package do not succeed.Boehner's office said even a 
two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
 010, after stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second 
time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I
iece of material data about loans held by Fannie Mae was known 
to the United States government to the investing public," Mudd said. "The 
SEC is wrong, and I look forward to a court where fairness 
and reason -- not politics -- is the standard for justice."Syron's lawyer 
couldn't be immediately reached for comment.According to the lawsuit, Fannie told investors 
in 2007 that it had roughly $4.8 billion worth of subprime loans 
on its books, or just 0.2 percent of its portfolio. The SEC 
says that Fannie actually had about $43 billion worth of products targeted 
to borrowers with weak credit, or 11 percent of its holdings.Mudd told 
a congressional panel in March 2007 that Fannie's subprime business represented less 
than "2 percent of our book." He also said the company held 
subprime mortgages "very carefully."Freddie told investors in 2006 that it held between 
$2 billion and $6 billion of subprime mortgages on its books. The 
SEC says its holdings were actually closer
