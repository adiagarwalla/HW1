WASHINGTON  At least two New Hampshire Republicans are accusing Newt Gingrich's 
presidential campaign of making illegal political telephone calls.Jim Foley, chairman of the 
Derry GOP, on Friday filed a complaint against Gingrich with the state 
attorney general's office. Foley is not affiliated with any presidential campaign."I think 
it's a real lack of understanding, almost arrogance, in the Gingrich campaign 
staff about how things are done in New Hampshire. I can't stand 
idly by," Foley told The Associated Press.He was joined by former state 
House Speaker Donna Sytek, a Mitt Romney supporter, who filed a separate 
complaint with state prosecutors.Gingrich, the former House speaker, has surged to the 
lead in many Republican presidential polls across the country in recent weeks.At 
issue is a New Hampshire law that prevents political campaigns from using 
pre-recorded political messages -- known as "robo-calls" -- to contact state residents 
on a national do-not-call
-meaning movie actually painted black housekeepers from the early civil rights era 
in an unflattering light.Brad Pitt gets a nod for "Moneyball," even though 
some found it dull. So does Leonardo DiCaprio for "J. Edgar," despite 
some possibly unconvincing old-man makeup.PHOTOS: See the latest celebrity pictures to hit 
the Internet.With a month to go until Ricky Gervais hosts the show 
on NBC, let us know: What was the lamest Golden Globe nomination?
ing.Many Democratic strategists hoped that Sanchez, who was born in the Rio 
Grande Valley, could marshal votes from the state's growing Hispanic population.But many 
liberals felt he was a flawed candidate because he was the commanding 
general in Iraq when the abuses against Iraqi detainees at Abu Ghraib 
prison took place.The official filing period for prospective candidates ends Monday. But 
because of ongoing litigation over political redistricting in Texas, the filing period 
will reopen after a federal court approves a final district map, likely 
in late January, and remain open until Feb. 1.A new Democratic candidate 
could emerge once the courts decide the districts for the Texas House, 
Texas Senate and U.S. Congress. If the court's decision hurts Democratic chances 
for Congress, some of those politicians might consider switching to the Senate 
race.No Democrats hold statewide office in Texas, and the predominantly Republican state 
is unlikely to elect a Democra

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> treated so harshly in years, the authorities have done so with 
other dissidents.Du Daobin, an outspoken critic also convicted of subversion and sentenced 
to three years in prison in 2004, did not immediately start his 
sentence, according to the Laogai Research Foundation, a Washington-based advocacy group that 
runs a website for which Du wrote.Instead, Du was released and lived 
under probation for four years before being sent to prison in 2008, 
apparently because he continued to criticize the government online.Gao's family and supporters 
meanwhile have continued to campaign for him, with little result. His brother, 
Zhiyi, has been on a constant search for information. When he asked 
Beijing police in September about his brother, one officer told him Gao 
Zhisheng was a "missing person and no one knows where he is."
 reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to
If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a
