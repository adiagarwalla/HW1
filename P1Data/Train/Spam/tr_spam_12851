ooking to stay at the top.To do that, Gingrich is focusing on 
ideology as he courts the Iowa conservatives he needs to win the 
caucuses and challenge Romney's well-organized campaign in what could become a drawn-out 
primary. He has mounted a broad attack on federal judges and the 
Supreme Court, arguing that they are legislating from the bench and have 
more control over the country than they should.It's an argument that drew 
sustained applause during a debate last week in Sioux City, Iowa -- 
and one that could have particular resonance in a state where Republicans 
fought a protracted battle with state Supreme Court judges over gay marriage."The 
Manchester Union Leader which is a reliably conservative newspaper endorsed me and 
the Des Moines Register, which is a solidly liberal newspaper did not 
endorse me," Gingrich said Sunday. "I think that indicates who the conservative

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">December 17, 2011: This surveillance photo provided by the New York (City) 
Police Dept. shows a suspect wanted in connection with a homicide, in 
the Brooklyn borough of New York. A New York City man was 
arrested and charged with murder after allegedly burning an elderly woman to 
death inside her apartment building elevator over $2,000 he claims she owed 
him.Authorities said that when 73-year-old Deloris Gillespie went up the elevator to 
her fifth-floor Brooklyn apartment on Saturday, carrying groceries, suspect Jerome Isaac was 
waiting.Surveillance video from inside the small elevator shows 47-year-old Isaac looked something 
like an exterminator, with a canister sprayer, white gloves and a dust 
mask, which was perched atop his head like a pair of sunglasses. 
The sprayer was full of flammable liquid.When the elevator opened Saturday afternoon, 
the suspect sprayed the woman, who turned around and crouched down to 
try to protect herself, New York Police Department 
 er, and hydrocarbons are Russia's key export commodity. But, it produces most 
of its oil onshore and hasn't had any significant oil platform accidents 
in recent years.The platform -- 226 feet long and 262 feet wide 
-- was built in Finland in 1985. It has recently done some 
work for Russian energy giant Gazprom.There has been no report of environmental 
damage, but there is likely to be little because the rig only 
carried a small amount of fuel.Russian newspapers on Monday speculated about whether 
there could have been fewer deaths if the rig's owner had taken 
more people off the rig before it was moved.Russian law allows only 
a "minimal number of crew members" to be aboard the platform while 
it is being towed and bars any non-crew members or passengers. Reports 
said that at least 14 people aboard were not crew members.
