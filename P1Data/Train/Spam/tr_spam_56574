about Gingrich may opt to lodge protest votes with former Pennsylvania Sen. 
Rick Santorum.As voters in a winner-take-all state, Florida Republicans know that only 
first place really matters and may more quickly flee a candidate they 
perceive as flawed if he or she doesnt look viable.A better-than-expected showing 
for Santorum, who has been polling around 13 percent, would be one 
of the best signs of an impending romp for Romney. In 2008, 
second-tier Florida candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Ron Paul took 31 
percent of the vote. If Santorum and Pauls combined statewide vote share 
approaches that number, Gingrich will be in big trouble.Money MattersPart of what 
is driving the change in the Florida electorate is frustration with one 
of the hardest economic falls in the nation.When voters were going to 
the polls in 2008, Floridas unemployment rate was 4.6 percent, the same 
as the nation overall, and had been lower than the national average 
for many mont
 six months. Senior administration officials said they hoped such a requirement 
would help build support on Capitol Hill and address critics who ask 
why the government is helping people who borrowed more than they could 
afford.Click here to read more from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).
use their training is paid for; school is the biggest expense for 
non-military pilots. It is a double whammy to have loans to pay 
for school and survive on such little pay. But, we love what 
we do so much that we deal with it.Do you get paid 
more if you trained with the military versus at a flight school?No, 
we all start at the same pay at my airline although it 
depends if youre hired as a first officer or captain.Do you ever 
find yourself being treated differently by more experienced pilots because you are 
so young?On the flight deck, it depends. Most pilots respect each other 
and their decisions although occasionally advice and recommendations for how to do 
things are shared. However, there are a few more senior pilots that 
were furloughed from major airlines that now find themselves flying regional jets. 
They feel like they are superior to those who are just starting 
out and often seem a bit condescending. It is all part of 
the learning experience though

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

 called as a witness in the child-endangerment trial of a high-ranking former 
aide accused of moving sexually-abusive priests to new churches as part of 
a systematic cover-up of child sex allegations.Last year, following the second grand 
jury report, prosecutors said not much had changed since the first investigation, 
when the "abuse was known, tolerated, and hidden by high church officials, 
up to and including the Cardinal (Bevilacqua) himself."As a church leader, Bevilacqua 
campaigned for a moratorium on the death penalty and often spoke out 
against homosexuality, birth control and abortion. He headed the influential bishops' Committee 
on Pro-Life Activities.In 2002, when the church came under fire for clerical 
sexual abuse, he called homosexuality an "aberration, a moral evil" and suggested 
gays were more likely to commit abuse. Under Bevilacqua, the Philadelphia archdiocese 
tried to weed out gay candidates to the priesthood and expelled any 
seminarian found 
e values of democracy, fueling public anger that spilled into heated December 
protests.Putin initially played down the street rallies and derided the participants as 
U.S. puppets working to undermine Russia. He later took a more conciliatory 
stance, in an apparent effort to split the opposition.He promised Wednesday to 
give government jobs to some of his political opponents if he is 
elected.Putin also instructed vote monitors to ensure strict observance of election rules. 
He previously has ordered that web cameras be installed in all polling 
stations in an effort to fend off opposition claims of persistent vote 
rigging.
