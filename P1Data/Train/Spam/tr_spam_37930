<p style="font-size:xx-small;">itor, Zhejiang Youngman Lotus Automobile Co., said it pulled out after the 
last proposal for a solution was rejected by GM over the weekend."We 
were supporting them to the last moment, even up to 1 a.m. 
this morning we were discussing possible solutions by telephone, but due to 
GM's position, in the end Sweden's Saab filed for bankruptcy this morning," 
said Rachel Pang, an executive director of a subsidiary company of Youngman 
and daughter of Youngman's founder, Pang Qingnian.Swedish lawyer and reconstruction expert Peter 
Smedman said the prospects of selling Saab during bankruptcy proceedings would depend 
on GM."The licenses that GM has are crucial for the value of 
the company," Smedman said. "If GM doesn't want to let anyone in 
because they are scared of competition in China, then there is probably 
not much (value) left."Originally an aircraft maker, Saab entered into the auto 
market after World War II with the first production of the two-stroke-engine 
Saab 
  capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte

names on Democratic Party petitions that put then-candidates Barack Obama and Hillary 
Clinton on the primary ballot were forged.Voters have told Fox News that 
their signatures and personal information were fraudulent, and that they never signed 
the petitions that were certified by the St. Joseph County Voter Registration 
Board.U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Indiana David A. Capp has 
previously declined to investigate the allegations, citing a lack of federal jurisdiction."The 
U.S. attorney does not investigate allegations of fraud in the submission of 
petitions by political parties for the placement of the names of candidates 
on the ballot for federal primary elections," Dvorak said in a statement 
in October after discussions with Capp."They do, however, investigate fraud in voter
