United Nations Humanitarian Service

>From the Desk of

Dr. Christopher Colon

Liberia.


6th January 2015.




Dear Friend,




I am among the team of doctors deployed by the United nations humanitarian service to combat the on going Ebola epidemic virus depleting the west Africans.




The virus have caused a total of 33,000,000.00 in the United States currency to the GDP of the gold and mining operation since it's discovery in Liberia.




I decided to take up this call of service to humanity because I lost my wife to cancer in 2012 and I have decided to dedicate my life to the saving of lives.




I have a prominent patient by the name of Chief Collins Freeman a gold and diamond merchant mining in the rural areas of Liberia, he has contacted the virus and is currently undergoing the experimental treatment provided by the U.S research board.




He has confided in me about his fortune valued at 10,750,000 in the United states currency and 40 KG of Gold Dustwhich he has deposited with a safe house in Accra Ghana. He has requested a foreign partner who can assist him receive the fund and Gold and use in the purchase of the drugs for the treatment of the Ebola Virus.




As a doctor, I cannot leave my assigned duty to pursue the fund because there are alot of patients that needs my attention in this rural area and it will be against my professional ethics.




Hence, I decided to contact you to act as the receiving beneficiary of the package, he has agreed to give us 40



There is urgency needed in your response because the virus has eaten deeply into Chief Collins Freeman and his chances of surviving is very slim. The virus has killed the rest of his family and there is no next of kin left to inherit the fund and that is why chief Freeman wants to volunteer the fund for the saving of other lives.




It is our duty call as humans to serve humanity and your part in this transaction will go down the history of mankind as one of the saviour of lives in Liberia.




I anticipate your earnest response.




Yours faithfully,

Dr. Christopher Colon
