APSeptember 7: Victor Muller, Spyker Chief Executive and Chairman of Saab Automobile, 
speaks during a news conferense in Trollhattan, Sweden.STOCKHOLM  Saab Automobile filed 
for bankruptcy on Monday, giving up a desperate struggle to stay in 
business after previous owner General Motors Co. blocked takeover attempts by Chinese 
investors.Saab CEO Victor Muller personally handed in the bankruptcy application to a 
court in southwestern Sweden, ending his two-year effort to revive the carmaker 
that over more than six decades has become known for its rounded 
sedans and quirky design features.The Vanersborg District Court was expected to approve 
the application later Monday."This is the most unwelcome Christmas gift I could 
have imagined," said Fredrik Almqvist, 36, who has worked at Saab's assembly 
line for nearly 17 years.While experts say the company is likely to 
be chopped up and sold in parts, local officials in the town 
of Trollhattan, where Saab employs more tha
 capabilities.Germany's Foreign Ministry said it has "clear expectations" of North Korea's 
new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte
are a bad match. The real question is whether there is any 
more toxic coupling?Only if you threw Lindsay Lohan into the mix, Levitt 
said.Kim Kardashian's Tiniest DressesBecause sometimes those with the most to cover, wear 
the least.
