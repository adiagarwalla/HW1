Just imagine everything you could hope to find in a hot dog, 4271028 that is what Victor Ruiz has done here at Sweet Dogs. 

It's not just your typical, I mean sure, if that's what you're all about, 4271028 then go for it, they'll make one right for you. But this menu has brought a local feel to hot dogs. The names are enticing, everything from The Heat to The U to The Panther. It's delicately awesome. And what goes into these dogs is flavorful and unique. I tried The Marlin, and as tasty as it was, I can't wait to return to try the whole entire hot dog team.

Oh, and you get a mini candy to go with it? Don't mind if I do. 4271028 And what goes better with hot dogs than ice cream and milkshakes? Or homemade mac n cheese, seasoned fries? Yum, yum and yum.

As the mastermind behind this hot dog venue, what Victor Ruiz is doing is amazing and he needs to keep right at it. Talking to him, you can tell that he is one passionate fellow and his enthusiasm helps make this such a great establishment.9596bbdfe98d5d18e13b8cde2910949b
