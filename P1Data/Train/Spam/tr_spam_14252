a cocktail but my friend tried one of their margaritas and said it was good and had a lot of alcohol for $11.  Anyways, I would probably come back but not right away as there are so many other good places to eat in Vegas. We've been here for food a few times and just drinks several more times. 4440836 service has been amazing and poor. 4440836 food is good to great, 4440836 margaritas are excellent. First 4440836 drinks, they really know margaritas. I don't think their "Mesa Margarita" is good but not great. It's a good start that runs slightly sweet without being 4440836 typical "punch-style" margarita. With 4440836 Especial Margarita, you call 4440836 tequila and pick one of three orange liqueurs. If you've got a favorite tequila in mind you want this.  Finally, they have 4440836 Partida. It's served straight up in a martini glass. But you can get it in a bucket if you prefer. Because there's no ice, it's going to look small. Don't slam this drink. Enjoy it!  Some people think it's too sour, I think it's an amazing drink. On our first visit a few years ago, lunch was average. 4440836 food was good but 4440836 various odd plate shapes actually made eating a bit awkward, maybe we were just tired after 4440836 flight. Recently, four of us had dinner and it was probably one of 4440836 best service experiences any of us has  ever had in a restaurant. At 4440836 start, 4440836 wine sommelier switched gears into a beer and tequila expert without missing a beat. I'm pretty sure this isn't his job, but he stepped up and took our entire drink order. We were being pretty picky about what we wanted (me about 4440836 margaritas and another guy about beer and tequila combinations), he accommodated everything, offered great alternatives when they didn't stock what we asked for and never made us feel like we were too demanding (we probably were). Our whole party clicked with 4440836 waitress. She played along well with our "we're going to be here a while, drink and eat a bunch, we might be a pain in 4440836 ass, and we'll tip well for it" vibe. Seriously 4440836 best service I can remember in a restaurant. For food, two of us has 4440836 chile relleno (it's really stuffed eggplant), my wife thought her chicken was good, but my pork tenderloin was 4440836 winner at 4440836 table. I'll order that again and again. On a different night, we went for appetizers after 10pm. Our waitress seemed uninterested and annoyed from 4440836 time she walked up. During our stay, we saw her engaging with other tables for long periods of time, but she never checked on us. Maybe we did something early to set her off, maybe four appetizers plus drinks didn't impress her. <br /></span></td>
