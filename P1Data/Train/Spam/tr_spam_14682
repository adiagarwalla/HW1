when a zip lining accident went from bad to much, much worse. 
Just one week ago, Aimee was enjoying a trip kayaking down a 
creek with some of her friends in Carrollton, Ga. But when she 
stopped to ride on a homemade zip line along the water, the 
line snapped and cut a large gash in her left calf.Initially, Aimee 
had gone to the emergency room at the Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton on Tuesday after she had received the gash. She thought the 
ordeal was over after the doctors stapled her leg up with 22 
staples and told her to take pain medication, according to her father.But 
Aimee returned to the hospital Wednesday after she continued to complain of 
severe pain in her leg. She was prescribed pain killers and sent 
home yet again.The pain still did not subside, so a friend drove 
a pale and weak Aimee to Tanner Medical again Friday morning. When 
she arrived, an ER doctor diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis  a 
flesh-eating bacteria disorder of the deep la
A list of major suicide bombings and large-scale explosions during Syria's 14-month 
uprising:  Dec. 23, 2011    Two car bombers blow 
themselves up near intelligence agency compounds in the capital Damascus, killing 44 
people in the first suicide attacks since the uprising began in March. 
 Jan. 6, 2012    Two weeks later, another suicide 
explosion rips through a busy intersection and a police bus in the 
capital's Midan neighborhood, killing 26 people.  Feb. 10, 2012   
 Two suicide car bombers strike in the northern city of Aleppo, 
Syria's largest, killing 28 people near a military intelligence building and the 
barracks of security forces.  March 3, 2012    A 
suicide car bomb explodes at a roundabout in Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising, killing at least two people in the first suicide attack 
in an opposition stronghold.  March 17, 2012    Three 
suicide bombings in Damascus kill at least 27 people, two of them 
near-simultaneous suicide car bomb attacks on
 hit us with that. But then I said, Hey, Aimee is 
not your average patient.To keep people updated on his daughters status, Copeland 
set up the Facebook page Believe and pray for a miracle to 
happen for Aimee Copeland. Through the page, friends and family also have 
been calling for blood donations to help save Aimees life. So far, 
the page has garnered over 17,000 followers, all sending their thoughts and 
prayers to the Copeland family. The bottom line is that I've been 
asking people to pray and give blood, Copeland said. I want to 
create awareness about giving blood for this particular disease. Blood is required 
to save her.Copeland says that he is certain his daughter will make 
it through these tragic circumstances, and he cannot wait to see Aimee 
smile again.I will never quit on my daughter, Copeland said. And my 
daughter will be a remarkable miracle the world's going to enjoy. The 
more I put that out there, the more people will rally. That's 
whats keep h

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

  sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde
al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
