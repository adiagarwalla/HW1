use their training is paid for; school is the biggest expense for 
non-military pilots. It is a double whammy to have loans to pay 
for school and survive on such little pay. But, we love what 
we do so much that we deal with it.Do you get paid 
more if you trained with the military versus at a flight school?No, 
we all start at the same pay at my airline although it 
depends if youre hired as a first officer or captain.Do you ever 
find yourself being treated differently by more experienced pilots because you are 
so young?On the flight deck, it depends. Most pilots respect each other 
and their decisions although occasionally advice and recommendations for how to do 
things are shared. However, there are a few more senior pilots that 
were furloughed from major airlines that now find themselves flying regional jets. 
They feel like they are superior to those who are just starting 
out and often seem a bit condescending. It is all part of 
the learning experience though
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.Investors will also focus on monthly hiring figures from private payroll 
agency ADP.
FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents 
further erode support for the in

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">UniversalDoc Brown, the crazy inventor from Back to the Future, may not 
have perfected his mind-reading contraption, but real scientists are still trying.BERKELEY, Calif. 
 You may idly wish you could hear what others are thinking 
yet write off telepathy as science fiction. But one day, the ability 
to read peoples minds may not be a talent reserved for psychics 
and the X-Men.A group of neuroscientists at the University of California, Berkeley, 
reported they may have come up with a scientific way to read 
peoples minds.Led by post-doctoral researcher Brian Pasley, the scientists have developed a 
method for deciphering the electrical signals in a persons brain as they 
listen to words or conversation.Upon figuring out these signals, they were then 
able to use them to recreate the imagined speech of the same 
person.The secret to their method lies in the temporal lobe of the 
brain, which is used in auditory perception. When a person hears a 
word or phrase being spok
 CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
d William Wilson the right to information concerning Goodman's adoption.The civil trial 
is set for March 27 and Kelley had previously ruled that the 
trust set up for Goodman's two minor children could not be considered 
as part of his financial worth if a jury awarded damages to 
the Wilsons.Hutchins is now entitled to at least a third of the 
trust's assets as 48-year-old Goodman's legal daughter, according to the adoption papers.Dan 
Bachi, Goodman's civil attorney, said Hutchins' adoption was done to ensure the 
future stability of his children and family investments."It has nothing to do 
with the lawsuit currently pending against him," Bachi said.
