Fire Hydrant
 A variation of the time honored Doggy Style. This move opens up the receiving partner's legs and as you can see from the animation, gives them a pronounced tilt of the hips; this angle lends itself well to deep thrusting, g-spot stimulation and great pleasure for both lovers. The sensation of being partly suspended can also impart a sense http://www.velberg.by/rediscovered of liberation, not to mention kinkiness. 
 Probably most similar to Bulldog, the receiver gets down on all fours in front of their partner, who is kneeling behind. The receiver lifts up one leg behind and places it onto the giver's thigh. You may want to change legs in this pose not only to prevent cramping, but to change the direction of penetration for the receiver. Who knows . those women whose g-spots are elusive may finally be able to locate their bliss button
