when they all seem to disappear). We ordered 4029713 Tenderloin Tartar for an appetizer -- great flavors -- capers & a nice amount of acid with a creamy caper aoili on top, with grilled bread as a side.  Nice flavors -- hit 4029713 spot -- set a high standard. We also received 4029713 typical breadbasket with some hits & some misses -- 4029713 blue corn muffins were so dry they were almost inedible, but 4029713 blueberry crumble bar was divine & 4029713 little corn muffins with fresh jalapenos were delicious.  4029713 cranberry & fruit/nuts muffin was ok. Our entrees, however, were not up to par.  Hubby got 4029713 MG Burger, ordered medium with a pink center.
