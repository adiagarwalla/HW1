Block Carbs the Oprah Way and drop 17lbs, here
http://compare.makingdietgrowth.click
No-Cost Shipping 1-17-15.










I went here for the first time on Jan 3 (Saturday night) with 3 friends and it was all great. 

We waited a *little* 12041652 while for a server to check in with us, but none of us minded the time to browse the menu and catch up with each other. Once we ordered, our food came out promptly (but not alarmingly quickly - you know how you get suspicious sometimes, when your food comes out way faster than you expected?). 

I got the Trickster stout and it was a little hoppy, but delicious (I imagine that's why they call it the Trickster...).

We waited a *little* 12041652 while for a server to check in with us, but none of us minded the time to browse the menu and catch up with each other.

I got the Trickster stout and it was a little hoppy, but delicious (I imagine that's why they call it the Trickster...). 

The burgers were tasty, cooked just right, 12041652 neither overloaded nor skimpy on "toppings," creative options, and not greasy. The fries were also good, not crazy salty, and not greasy, either. As far as I was told, everyone else thought their food was great, too. 

Our server was good - not too involved with us, adequately attentive. I'm fine with a server who is conversational with me, or who is nice but mostly business. He checked on us for more beer a few times, 75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43 but it didn't come off as pushy or impatient, just thorough. 

The  level was just fine. 12041652 I feel like I could take my hard-of-hearing dad here and he'd be able to participate in the conversation. The atmosphere/decor was great, in my opinion. I currently live in Denver, but I'm from Portland, OR, and the moment I walked in I said to my friend, "Oooo, this is nice. It's got a very Portland feel with a snow sports meets (Grateful) Dead Head vibe." Personally, I love when a place reminds me of home. 

It is cash or check only, but a) they have an ATM, 12041652 does have a service charge; b) they do their best to make that known (:cough: a lot of other reviews on Yelp mention it); c) it's really not that bad..... There's a review in which the author says the pub has "great food, service, beer" etc, but simply because they don't take credit/debit cards, they will "never be back." :rolls eyes: Get over it.

***I think it's important to point out that a lot of the 1- and 2-star reviews of this place are pretty old. I'm not saying that it's perfect every time nowadays (first of all, I've only visited once), but it's worth mentioning. Maybe pay more attention to the reviews within the last two years.***75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43
