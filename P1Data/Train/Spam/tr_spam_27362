good. Nothing amazing for either of us and a bit pricey at around $17 a pop. The best thing about this place was the bread basket filled with amazing bread, muffins etc (some sweet, some savory and some spicy). I wish they offered their regular lunch menu on the weekends.

To start we each got a margarita only because it is their specialty drink .... Yum. Wow! And for apps the fundito quest and duck pancake which were both truly fantastic and recommended by our server as favorites. The quest dip was hot and spicy and gooey ... Served on a little skillet,
