DETROIT  Chrysler, propelled by higher sales of Jeeps and other revamped 
cars and trucks, reported its first annual net income since 1997, capping 
a pivotal turnaround year that many thought would never come.The U.S. automaker, 
now privately held and majority owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183 
million last year, reversing a $652 million loss in 2010, its first 
full year out of bankruptcy protection.Chrysler expects an even better 2012, despite 
a sluggish and uncertain economy. The company, which sells most of its 
vehicles in the U.S., predicts it will make about $1.5 billion this 
year and increase revenue 18 percent."The house is in good order," CEO 
Sergio Marchionne said Wednesday. "Now we greet a new year of high 
expectations with our heads down, forging ahead."Chrysler spent much of 2010 designing 
new vehicles and trying to spruce up an archaic lineup that wasn't 
selling well.Now those vehicles are in showrooms, and they've sold far better 
than expecte
s is the least intrusive method for going after these militants."Our ability 
to respect the sovereignty of other countries and to limit out incursions 
into somebody else's territory is enhanced by the fact that we are 
able to pinpoint strike an al Qaeda operative in a place where 
the capacities of that military in that country may not be able 
to get them," Obama said.To go after these militants in any other 
way, he said, would involve "more intrusive military actions."The president's remarks are 
unlikely to weaken the already fragile relationship with Pakistan because it's mostly 
immaterial to them whether or not the U.S. is discussing the operations 
or not.It may, however, change that one-liner that press secretaries and spokesman 
in Washington so frequently utter about not talking about intelligence matters.
PARACHINAR, Pakistan  Government officials say Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant positions 
in two different areas along the Afghan border, killing 31 suspected insurgents.Political 
administrators Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul say the strikes occurred Wednesday morning 
in the Orakzai and Kurram tribal areas.It was not possible to independently 
confirm the information because the areas are effectively off-limits to reporters.The strikes 
followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram 
that killed over 60 people in the last week.The Pakistani military has 
launched a series of offensives against militants in the country's semiautonomous tribal 
region in the past few years.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said. 
 ooking for activists.In the central city of Homs, one of the biggest 
flashpoints of the uprising and a scene of daily fighting, government troops 
were shelling neighborhoods and fighting defectors in several neighborhoods. At least eight 
residents were killed, the Observatory said.Regime troops were also fighting defectors Wednesday 
in the northeastern region of Idlib and the southern area of Daraa, 
activists said.The U.N. estimated several weeks ago that more than 5,400 people 
have been killed in the Syrian government crackdown, but has not been 
able to update the figure. The death toll from Monday's offensive in 
the suburbs was around 100 people, making it among the bloodiest days 
since the uprising began, according to the two activist groups.The U.N. Security 
Council resolution would give Assad 15 days to start implementing the Arab 
peace plan and halt the crackdown, otherwise the Council would consider "further 
measures."That would likely mean economic and 
Political Forecast: Five More Weeks of CrazyAs this primary unfolds our opponents 
in the other party have been watching, and they like to comfort 
themselves with the thought that a competitive campaign will leave us divided 
and weak. But I've got news for them, a competitive primary does 
not divide us it prepares us and we will win.-- Former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney in his Florida primary victory speech."It is now clear 
that this will be a two-person race between the conservative leader, Newt 
Gingrich, and the Massachusetts moderate, and the voters of Florida made that 
clear.-- Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich in a speech to supporters following 
his Florida primary defeat.Pity the political pundits. Is the Republican race about 
over or just warming up? Is the GOP electorate falling in line 
or getting ready for a six-month civil war?The pundits cant know, but 
thats never stopped them from telling you before, so why should it 
now?Talking heads are talki
