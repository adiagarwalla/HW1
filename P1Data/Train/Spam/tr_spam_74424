ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">AP/Bay Area News GroupIn this photo taken Sunday, Dec. 11, 2011, absorbent 
towels soak up pollutants in Strawberry Creek on after a diesel fuel 
spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and 
makes decisions, in a way that will give it vastly expanded power 
to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development,

Janeiro next June.The major focus of the EPA thinking is a we
 negotiations, providing food aid as an incentive to the starving nation. Officials 
who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity said Kim's 
death would likely delay the effort.With Kim's death, the U.S. is also 
in the position of seeking to reassure China that a security commitment 
with South Korea is not a threat to the North's lone ally. 
China had been expected to host talks on Thursday in Beijing between 
U.S. and North Korean diplomats about restarting nuclear disarmament efforts. That meeting 
in turn could lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that 
would also include China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The food aid had 
been seen as an incentive to get North Korea to the table, 
In exchange, the North would agree to suspend its controversial uranium enrichment 
program, which would lead to six-party talks with China, Japan, Russia, the 
U.S. and North and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held
