<p style="font-size:xx-small;">oters and Which Ones?In 2008, there were 1.95 million Republican primary votes 
cast in Florida. Pollsters and pundits disagree on whether there will be 
more or fewer this time around, and, more importantly, which regions of 
the state will turn out most heavily.There are some signs of a 
much higher turnout than last time. Not only is the race hotter, 
but weve seen turnout increases in the three previous nominating contests. While 
the growth was modest in Iowa and New Hampshire, the January 21 
South Carolina primary shattered all Republican records in the state with a 
35 percent increase over 2008.In Florida, there has been a surge in 
early and absentee ballots with some 600,000 votes already cast  about 
100,000 more than 2008, a 20 percent increase. Some of that represents 
voters becoming increasingly familiar with Floridas permissive voting laws and some reflects 
an unprecedented push for early voters by the Romney campaign (a Miami

 WASHINGTON  Builders increased their spending in December for the fifth consecutive 
month, offering more evidence of improvement in the battered construction industry. Housing, 
nonresidential construction and government projects all showed gains.The Commerce Department says spending 
on construction projects rose 1.5 percent in December after a revised 0.4 
percent gain in November. That pushed spending to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of $816.4 billion, the highest level in 20 months.Even with the 
gains, spending for all of 2011 was just $787.4 billion. That's 2 
percent lower than the previous year and roughly half the level economists 
consider healthy. Last year was the worst year on record for single-family 
home construction, according to a separate government report previously released.Analysts say it 
could be four years before the industry returns to full health.Residential construction 
rose 0.8 percent on the strength of single-family homes. Nonresidentia

and Kia Motors America.Still, U.S. auto sales are expected to rise by 
about a million this year, to near 14 million, and Chrysler is 
expected to get a share of the increase.President Barack Obama has been 
touting Chrysler's turnaround in recent appearances ahead of the November presidential election. 
Obama cast the deciding vote to save Chrysler and authorized much of 
the $12.5 billion in government funding that bailed out the company. Of 
the original bailout to Chrysler and its financial arm, the government said 
it was repaid all but $1.3 billion.Chrysler's turnaround has helped the U.S. 
economy. Chrysler now employs 57,200 people, 9,400 more than it did when 
the company left bankruptcy protection in 2009. On Thursday, Marchionne is expected 
to announce more than 1,000 new hires at the company's assembly plant 
in Belvidere, Ill. Chrysler is expected to add a third shift at 
the plant, whic
