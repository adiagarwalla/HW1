rightest as Winslets heedless husband. Waltzs delivery is impeccable and his candor 
is the most entertaining. Winslet, too, shows a comically detestable side. Theres 
great pleasure in seeing the typically serious actress spiral down to grim 
stupidity. John C. Reilly is delightful, as usual, and provides the only 
realism in the film.Carnage is an inverted and contemporary Lord of the 
Flies, where the adults, not the kids, are stripped to their primal 
selves. When executed well, the story is a superb social experiment, but 
unfortunately Polanski gives us a bland and fizzling undertaking.Stick to the play.
 reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o

sometimes staying there.As red-faced investigators repeatedly failed to catch him, his antics 
escalated: He began stealing planes from small, rural airports and crash-landing them 
-- at least five in all."What was characterized by the media as 
the swashbuckling adventures of a rakish teenager were in fact the actions 
of a depressed, possibly suicidal young man with waxing and waning post-traumatic 
stress disorder (following his first plane crash in November 2008)," wrote Dr. 
Richard S. Adler, a psychiatrist who evaluated him for the defense lawyers.Waves 
of burglaries broke out on Orcas Island, where Kyle Ater runs his 
Homegrown Market and Deli, in late 2009 and in early 2010, after

time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when
