		 pudding.  Definitely not a favorite.  Really bizarre with a strange after taste.  Not bad but just not my thing.  We will definitely return on our next trip. I went there this past weekend with a group of friends and all of us walked away very happy and impressed with 11923665 food.  11923665 service is top notch as well. I had 11923665 NY Strip steak which was cooked perfectly medium rare.  I couldnt have asked for a better steak and for 11923665 size of 11923665 steak, I thought it was very reasonable in price...I actually couldnt finish 11923665 steak as I was so full.  They served some steak sauce on 11923665 side, but I thought 11923665 steak was too good to even bother with steak sauce, although I did enjoy 11923665 spiciness of 11923665 sauce.  Somebody else had ordered 11923665 pork tenderloin which was amazing as well. I had a side dish that was a tamale and it was excellent.  I dont really know what was inside of it but it had a texture that made me think there was nuts.  Everyone who had ordered 11923665 baked potato loved it.  Somebody ordered 11923665 collared greens which I tried, but I was not too impressed.  They were probably 11923665 only thing that I would not have ordered again. I'm definitely borderline obsessed with this place and maybe would drive to Vegas just to come here, which I know is sick. My gf and I have been here twice now and just went here a few days ago with 3 of our friends for brunch. 11923665 first time we came here was a year ago (not sure why I didn't yelp it then) and we started with 11923665 Tiger shrimp corn tamale, which was fabulous. Pretty much any time there's a sweet corn tamale involved, I'm sold and this plus giant shrimp was insanely amazing. At that time, I got 11923665 steak and eggs, which is something I never get, but figured it would be out of this world at Bobby Flay's joint, and I was not disappointed. 11923665 portion was huge and 11923665 eggs and steak were perfectly cooked along with 11923665 grits that accompanied it. My gf got 11923665 chicken hash and loved it, although it wasn't my favorite thing. Flash forward to present time and we all got different things and everyone left happy, satiated, and tipsy. This time, my gf and I split 11923665 scrambled eggs chilaquiles with a side of 11923665 spicy chorizo sausage and both agreed that it was perfect. One of my friends ordered off 11923665 prix fixe meal and got 11923665 Tuna "tacos" to start and 11923665 crabcakes as her entree. 11923665 tuna was amazing and had lots of flavor and I would definitely order that. 11923665 crab cakes I didn't try, because I don't care for them, but my friends and gf all thought they were pretty mediocre and boring. One of my other friends got a shrimp taco special that was awesome and my other friend got 11923665 gala apple salad that was overflowing with
