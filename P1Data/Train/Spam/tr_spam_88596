 Libya later next year, the U.S. could consider granting asylum."The perception 
is just because these folks received the scholarship from the Qaddafi family 
they are somehow aligned ... with the Qaddafi family," said Eugenia Zacks-Carney, 
an immigration attorney who has been working with the Libyans at Michigan 
State. "Nothing could be further from the truth."Michigan State launched the program 
in 2010 under a contract with Libya's National Economic Development Board to 
provide training in English, political science and international relations for future foreign 
service officials. Elbergwa, who describes her family as middle-class, was working toward 
a master's degree in international relations in Benghazi when she entered the 
program.She said that for those interested in public service in Libya, there

the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year

Romney has stepped away from his aggressive attacks on Gingrich in recent 
days, instead shifting his focus back to Obama -- and working to 
humanize himself on the campaign trail. That focus was on display in 
Sunday's interview, when Romney spoke emotionally about his wife's struggle with multiple 
sclerosis.He said the "toughest time" in his life was standing in the 
doctor's office waiting for her diagnosis. He said he feared she had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal degenerative

Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is
