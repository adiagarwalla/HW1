If you're in a DC & you want to get your hands on some cupcakey goodness, head over to Georgetown and get yourself a cupcake from Baked & Wired. 12667937 You will NOT be disappointed! While some people might tell you Georgetown Cupcake is where it's at, I truly beg to differ. At B&W you get a bigger cupcake with SO many flavor options that are truly unique! My two favorites? Dirty Chai & Flapjack with candied bacon on top! 

AMBIANCE: The ambiance here is an added bonus. On days where it's not too busy (typically weekdays) you can find yourself a spot to sit to enjoy your coffee/tea & pastry/cupcake! I really found it super cozy 12667937 & hip that it was decorated with various local art pieces and they have a wall filled with customer-decorated napkins! They also have a mini book exchange that adds to my admiration of this establishment.

THE SWEETS: All I can say is that your palette 07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f and stomach will not be disappointed. The cupcakes sold by B&W are worth the price tag. While you do have the option of getting more common flavors like vanilla and chocolate, B&W somehow is able to add their own flair and the frosting & the decor of the cupcake is just so unique, I literally CANNOT. If you're on a mission for satisfying your sweet tooth and you want to try new cupcake flavors, get your hands on a Baked & Wired Cupcake.

As I said earlier, I really enjoyed the 12667937 Flapjack cupcake because i felt like I was literally eating a pancake drenched in maple syrup and my tastebuds felt like they were in heaaaaaven. 

ALSO, FOOD FOR THOUGHT! B&W 12667937 is not just amazing because of their decadent cupcakes, but the other pastries they sell here are worth trying! I've had one of their brownies and it was so fudgey and chocolately and amazing. Chocolate wonderland in my mouth. 

DRINKS: While you can't purchase your drinks at the same time as your cupcakes, it's truly worth it to head to the attached cafe and purchase a cup of joe or tea! Also, if it's in season you should try the Chaider! A chaider combines the spice & savor elements of a chai tea with the sweetness of a spiced apple cider! So if you love chai, if you love apple cider, or if you just want to try something new - I say go for it! 'Tis the season! :).07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f
