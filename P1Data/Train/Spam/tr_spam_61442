o oversee security operations.Although the demonstrating oil workers in Zhanaozen were fired 
by their employers over the summer, the protests have continued unabated.Kasymov said 
that while the demonstrators have conducted themselves with restraint over the past 
seven months, the situation quickly deteriorated Friday morning, when participants in a 
children's concert in the main square came under attack.After overpowering the outnumbered 
police officers, a mob went on a rampage throughout the city, setting 
alight the mayor's office, a hotel, the UzenMunaiGas oil company headquarters and 
the local branch of the governing Nur Otan party, Kasymov said.Kasymov said 
police fired their weapons only because they were left with no other 
option."Nobody specifically gave the order to open fire in that situation. Every 
police officer took the decision themselves. When they take a weapon off 
you, there is no need for an order to be issued," Kasymov 
said.He also insisted tha

Raykovitz cited a Nov. 6 Second Mile statement that referred only to 
inappropriate conduct: "At no time was The Second Mile made aware of 
the very serious allegations contained in the Grand Jury report."The statement also 
said Curley, who has been placed on leave, told Raykovitz the shower 
incident "had been internally reviewed and that there was no finding of 
wrongdoing."But Lunsford said the charity's board couldn't take action in 2002 that 
might have prevented other assaults of children "if there's a cover-up from 
the source."Even if Raykovitz had only limited information, he still should have 
acted more aggressively in 2002 when contacted by Curley and should have 
viewed Curley's ban on Sandusky bringing Second Mile kids to campus as 
"a red flag," Lunsford said.As the person in charge, Raykovitz was legally 
required to provide the board all available information whether he believed it

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su

filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating
