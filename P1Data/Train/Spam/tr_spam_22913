<p style="font-size:xx-small;">.Campaigning will continue into next week, with Gingrich also planning to spend 
the early part of the week in Iowa. He'll head to New 
Hampshire Wednesday, where Romney will already be part way through a four-day 
bus tour. Romney won't return to Iowa until after Christmas.His confidence increasing, 
Romney has stepped away from his aggressive attacks on Gingrich in recent 
days, instead shifting his focus back to Obama -- and working to 
humanize himself on the campaign trail. That focus was on display in 
Sunday's interview, when Romney spoke emotionally about his wife's struggle with multiple 
sclerosis.He said the "toughest time" in his life was standing in the 
doctor's office waiting for her diagnosis. He said he feared she had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal degenerative 
nerve condition.The doctor "did these neurological tests, and then he -- and

 APFaeirouz Elbergwa was among an elite group of Libyans selected by the 
family of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi to come to the U.S. for 
a two-year diplomatic training program.EAST LANSING, Mich.  More than two years 
ago, Faeirouz Elbergwa was among a select group of Libyans sent by 
her government to an American university to train for the nation's diplomatic 
corps. As she prepares for the final stage of her studies, she 
and her colleagues now find themselves in an odd state of limbo 
-- a vestige of a regime that no longer exists and unsure 
what might await them in their much-changed homeland.Elbergwa, 27, and 18 colleagues 
in a Libyan diplomatic training program at Michigan State University watched in 
amazement during the last year as the North African nation was convulsed 
by a violent revolution that ended with the overthrow and death of 
leader Muammar Qaddafi.When the regime fell, many of the students were elated. 
Elbergwa said she and her family "took the

a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
