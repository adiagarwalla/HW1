		  Stopped in for an early lunch. It wasn't very crowded so I was expecting a little faster service...it wasn't terribly slow just not what I expected. I had the shrimp tacos. First, I was a little surprised that it was "build your own taco", but whatever. The shrimp were cooked fine, but they were over seasoned and so instead of flavor I just tasted sodium. The cabbage slaw topping was really tasty and the condiments were fresh and tasty. The bread basket was very good, especially the jalape??o bread. The price was a little steep for essentially 6 shrimp, some cabbage and bread (I just had water for drink) ...30 after tip. This was my first time frequenting a Bobby Flay establishment, and I wasn't disappointed. The service was impeccable, it got the point where it was borderline creepy how on-point the entire waiting staff was. All I can say is, the nice guy charged with watching my water glass better get a raise ASAP because he redefined the term "attentive." Due to several factors (okay fine, one factor: Vegas taking more money than expected), I ended up dismissing the many delectable looking meat entrees and ordered the Ancho Chile-Honey Glazed Salmon. And holy mother of food, was it sublime. On a more minor note, the bread is also a gamechanger. It might not be the gaudiest or most hyped restaurant on The Strip (or Caesers for that matter), but Mesa Grill is a top-notch option for anyone looking for a quality fine dining experience. Gorgeous place of course. Very modern, bright and open, it's Caesar's Palace and they really wanted Bobby Flay; as tasteful and modern as Southwestern can git. We went for lunch late on a Wed afternoon during a conference break and it was surprisingly slow there at 1:45. Breadbasket is delicious of course with those Jalapeno corn muffins, beautiful works of art at half yellow and blue corn swirl. We started by splitting the Blue Corn pancake BBQ Duck which was smoky with low heat and just yummy. For our entrees we had a Lamb chopped salad and a Chili Releno that looked even better than it tasted, and it tasted fantastic. They manage to get a very light batter on the chili and then somehow seal it with the cheese inside so that it 'blows up", really impressive. The lamb was a perfect medium rare and the salad good sized for what are generally small portions here. Presentation all Bobby Flay. Service from Michael was attentive, even relaxed considering there wasn't a dozen people in the restaurant, so come late our usual plan. They are definitely pushing drinks like most Vegas restaurants and you can see the disappointment in their faces when we order our usual lunch time iced tea and a water with lemon, no ice. Highly recommended and not crazy pricey, but still a $75 lunch with one appetizer and two entrees and one ice tea. Do it. Chef Bobby Flay's place in Vegas not bad service was outstanding food was good not awesome but then again it is not Bobby Flay cooking it is a Chef he has hired keep your expectations at that level and you will be pleased.
