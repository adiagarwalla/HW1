Reyes de armas
Hi there.

I'm translating a text and have gotten stuck on what "reyes de armas" would =
be in English. The sentence:

"...empezando por las dos enormes series de salvajes de tama=FF=FFo natural =
que custodian a ambos lados la entrada, los soldados y reyes de armas del se=
gundo piso, para terminar co
n..."

The text is about the facade of a church and here we are just dealing with t=
he description of said facade.

Currently I have translated it as "guardsmen" because it makes sense in cont=
ext, but I wanted to see if perhaps anyone could confirm this or correct me.=


Thanks so much!

I looked it up in the dictionary...
reyes means kings
armas means bombs
so it MIGHT mean kings' bombs but I don't think it makes sense in your text.=

No wait, it doesn't. Here's the translation of the whole text:
"... starting with the two sets of huge wild life-size on both sides that gu=
ard the entrance, soldiers and kings of arms of the second floor, to end ...=
"
so reyes de armas means kings of arms....

King of Arms is a legitimate rank in English. However, the definition seems =
to differ from that of a "rey de armas".
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Arms


WOOT! while making this post I think I found your answer!!!!

Herald of Arms seems to be the correct translation to English.

"Heralds were originally messengers sent by monarchs or noblemen to convey m=
essages or proclamations."

We have a "king of arms" of the Royal Family
Rey de armas Familia Real
So the translation of "Rey de armas" should be "Kings of arms"
But usually there was only one or two in every Kingdom, so here, in "los sol=
dados y reyes de armas del segundo piso," perhaps must be "officer of arms" =
version.
