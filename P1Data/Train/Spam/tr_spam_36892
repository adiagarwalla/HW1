The course selections remind me of my Italian experience. 22401530 First, second, main. The first course I had with help of my companions started with oysters on the half shell. Wonderfully fresh Nova Scotia oysters, I think they had been harvested that morning! In continuation we had shrimp in a cognac sauce 22401530 and pan seared scallops in its own spicy tomato based sauce. Both were flavourful and readied our taste buds for more.!!d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Few restaurants excel with such precision as The Bicycle Thief. 22401530 Everything about this restaurant, from its decor to its menu to its well-honed service, exudes a quiet confidence, a maturity, derived from setting an exacting attention to delivering a truly outstanding meal. There are so many showier and fancier and more exotic restaurants, but the Bicycle Thief knows--all the way through, how to  excel through restraint.

The menu here is very flexible, with small dishes, 22401530 pastas, as well as larger dishes. I opted for a pasta and a small dish, to save room for desert. I'm a pretty hearty eater, and I still left with cake in a doggie bag. If I was in a group, I could envision ordering a few more small dishes as a kind of tapas-style appetizers before turning to a main course.

I started with the tuna tartare, paired with a wasabi-mayo-style sauce. Admittedly, this isn't exactly Italian cooking, d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec but the waitress was fervent it was among the best of the small dishes on the menu. If you can get past the fact that this is beyond the traditional borders of Italian food, you'll be in for a treat. The tuna is fresh and flavourful, lightly topped with herbs, and partnered with wasabi kick. The portion is a hearty ramekin moulded on to a large plate--not a massive portion, but just enough to get you excited for what's coming next. 

On the advice again of my waitress, 22401530 I had the linguine with clams. This is Atlantic coast treat that I grew up all down the Eastern seaboard--and it can be a bit standardized at its worst. The linguine here is homemade, obviously, and paired with fresh clams, a bit of lobster (because, we're in Halifax, after all), and a light lacquer of fresh chilli oil gives the dish a wonderful aromatic heat. 22401530 With a nice dollop of fresh herbs and cheese grated table-side, it's not entirely uncommon, but rather, an elevated take on an old favourite. With fresh ingredients and a little bit of creativity, classics are upgraded and given a satisfying new take.

I was told, quite insistently, that there was no contest--I simply had to have the butterscotch cake, and I can confirm that is especially decadent and delicious--but perhaps too big for one to finish by his lonesome. But I'll agree wholeheartedly and say it's a delicious, moist cake that is a perfect finish to a great meal.!d32959a609f04c49ea13b4a1818609ec
