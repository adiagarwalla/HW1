Fun fact: Vietnam consumes the least amount of sugar in the world... 10571986 tied with North Korea.

I took a Vietnamese girl here once... she wasn't so impressed. So therefore, I have come to the conclusion that she has 10571986 no idea about what she's talking about... ever. NEVER BRINGING HER TO EAT VIETNAMESE AGAIN!

Anywho, I like to think places like these are exactly what our founding fathers had in mind when they were you know, b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7 inventing democracy. And capitalism. And robotic unicorns. And when Abraham Lincoln was freeing the slaves. Because if putting bulgogi in a Vietnamese sandwich isn't American, than I don't know what is.

It's definitely more fusion than it is 10571986 Vietnamese, which I can see why she was so lackluster about this place, but I didn't really care, as long as I get mine in (hehe, right guys?). But that's exactly why it's more popular than actual Vietnamese sandwiches. Because bulgogi is delicious! Kimchi fries are... delicious. Vietnamese iced coffee with your tripe is what? Delicious. If I could eat these all day, I would! Maybe with a shot of mayo too.

My favorite part? I can put a runny egg on everything. EVERYTHING! You can even put egg on egg. How's that for food porn?b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
