ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
 for The Associated Press, said the attacker looked like a man 
who lived with Gillespie for about six months last year and appeared 
to have been helping her out.That arrangement apparently ended by early 2011, 
but months later Holguin started seeing the man nearby on the street, 
looking "a lot more disheveled."Gillespie's nephew, Rickey Causey, told Fox affiliate WNYW-TV 
that his aunt had hired Isaac to do odd jobs around her 
apartment but fired him after she caught him stealing."He was doing more 
stealing than cleaning," Causey told the station.Causey said the suspect had left 
a note on Gillespie's door with a list of chores for which 
he was demanding payment, according to the station.Browne said that after setting 
Gillespie ablaze, Isaac set another fire at his own apartment building nearby, 
then hid on a roof before turning himself in to police.Isaac was 
arrested Sunday on first-degree murder and arson charges. The Brooklyn district attorney's 
office had no

spill closed Stanley Hall on the University of California campus in Berkeley, 
Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air 
quality testing and reopened Monday, Dec. 12, 2011, in time for finals, 
said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. 
Coast Guard and the California Department of Fish and Game have joined 
university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and

to regulate businesses, communities and ecosystems in the name of sustainable development,

from bipartisan compromises to kowtow to his extreme Tea Party wing of 
his caucus," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., chairman of the Democratic 
Caucus. "This is the latest example of the Tea Party Republicans sacrificing 
the good of the country on the alter of extreme ideology."But Republican 
Rep. Candice Miller of Michigan, said the short-term extension only ensures "more 
uncertainty.""How irresponsible for the U.S. Senate to pass only a two-month extension 
and then adjourn, essentially saying since they want to go home for 
Christmas the U.S. House must either take it or leave it?" she 
asked.
