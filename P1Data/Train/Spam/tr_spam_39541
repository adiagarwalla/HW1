Dear Jonothan=20

I read an interesting article the other day just thought I would
pass on the info=85=20

Feedback can be very helpful in many areas of business. But it=92s only
effective if you can actually get people to provide it. Surveys that
are long, confusing or difficult put people off. So here are a few
tips which may help,=20

Personalize Each Invitation
One way to make your survey request more effective
is to personalize it to each potential respondent. At the beginning of
a request this can encourage customers to offer their feedback, as
they are likely to feel that they will really be valued.=20


Offer a Small Incentive
Some customers will want to offer you their
feedback no matter what. But others might need just a little bit of a
push. So a small incentive, like a discount on their next purchase or
entry into a raffle, can really make a difference. It tells customers
that there=92s something in it for them.=20


Keep the Questions Simple
Once a customer has decided to take a survey, the
quickest way to turn them away is with long or complicated questions.
So keep all instructions, from the introduction, to the questions, to
the answer options, short and easy to understand.=20

Use Simple Graphics
Visuals and graphics can enhance your survey
request. For example, include a photo of the incentive you are
offering. But don=92t add too much. Keep it simple.=20

Assure People of Their Privacy
Many people are wary of taking surveys because they
think their information might be sold or used for purposes other than
your own research. Just a simple assurance can help customers feel
comfortable about filling it in.=20

Send a Reminder or Two
If you are sending your survey invitation via email, you can expect
to have the majority of responses come in during the first three days.
If you plan on having the survey open for longer then you will need to
send reminders, only keep it to 1 or 2.=20

Share the Results
When people take a survey, they like to know that
their input is appreciated, apart from receiving an incentive. So
after you=92ve compiled all the results, send a quick thank you stating
a few main points you learned and what, if any, changes you plan to
make because of it. This will help customers understand the power
their input can have. And that could encourage them to continue taking
part in your future surveys.=20

Cheers George.=20

PS. pass this on to anyone you think may find it if of use.=20
