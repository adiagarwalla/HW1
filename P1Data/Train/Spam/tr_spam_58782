President Obama on Wednesday endorsed same-sex marriages, becoming the first sitting U.S. 
president to take that position following days of speculation about his "evolving" 
stance on the issue.The president used a hastily called TV interview to 
make his position clear."At a certain point, I've just concluded that for 
me personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm 
that I think same-sex couples should be able to get married," Obama 
told ABC News.The president, who was previously opposed to the unions, explained 
that he's gone through an "evolution." Obama said he initially thought civil 
unions would suffice as a vehicle to give same-sex couples the rights 
commensurate with those of heterosexual couples. "I'd hesitated on gay marriage in 
part because I thought civil unions would be sufficient," he said.But he 
said his position evolved over the years, "as I have talked to 
friends and family and neighbors, when I think about members of my 
own staff w
 to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
DAMASCUS, Syria  Two suicide car bombs ripped through the Syrian capital 
Thursday, killing 55 people and tearing the facade off a military intelligence 
building in the deadliest explosions since the country's uprising began 14 months 
ago, the Interior Ministry said.Residents told an Associated Press reporter that the 
blasts happened in quick succession during morning rush hour, with an initial 
small explosion followed by a larger bomb that appeared aimed at onlookers 
and rescue crews arriving at the scene. Paramedics wearing rubber gloves collected 
human remains from the pavement as heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks 
smoldered.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's blasts. But an al-Qaida-inspired 
group has claimed responsibility for several past explosions, raising fears that terrorist 
groups are entering the fray and exploiting the chaos.In addition to the 
55 dead, the ministry also said there were 15 bags of human 
remains, meaning the death

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">yne, a Sydney-based aviation expert. "But if it's pilot error or the 
fault of air traffic control, it won't be quite so bad because 
they'll be able to say, 'Well, it's not the airplane'."The Superjet made 
its inaugural commercial flight last year."It is their big hope that they 
will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger 
way than they have," Ballantyne said."We all know that the Russians have 
had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this 
was vitally important to their industry."With a relatively low price tag of 
around $35 million, the plane has garnered around 170 orders. And Indonesia, 
the world's fourth most populous nation with a fast-growing middle class, is 
already one of the biggest customers.Kartika Airlines, Sky Aviation and Queen Air

 OKLAHOMA CITY  Mitt Romney says he believes marriage should be restricted 
to one man and one woman and that he's held that view 
"since running for office."Romney on Wednesday called same sex-marriage "a very tender 
and sensitive topic" as he contrasted his position with President Barack Obama's 
unequivocal declaration of support Wednesday for allowing same-sex couples to marry.Obama is 
the first president in history to support gay marriage. Polls show the 
country is evenly divided on the issue.Romney did not go so far 
as to accuse Obama of changing his position on the issue. Questioned 
by reporters, the presumptive Republican nominee for president said news reports indicate 
Obama has shifted his stance.Romney says states should be able to decide 
whether to grant certain legal benefits to same-sex couples.

eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that
