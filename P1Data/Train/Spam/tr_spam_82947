  police had been looking for him -- and his body was 
first spotted by a police helicopter in the small lake.After divers went 
in to recover the body, a second corpse was discovered later that 
night -- that of another man aged under 25, who was named 
by Sky News sources as Daniel Lloyd.Police are investigating and post-mortem examinations 
are due to take place.Click here to read more from SkyNews
 h is making the Dodge Dart, Chrysler's first competitive compact car in 
more than 15 years.The Dart is likely to help Chrysler boost its 
sales this year, and it will give the company a product to 
attract first-time buyers who generally stay with a brand if they like 
their first cars.Last year, Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was the Ram pickup, followed 
by the Grand Cherokee. Industry analysts expect pickup sales to slowly rebound 
this year as small businesses gain confidence and make investments. Both vehicles 
carry high sticker prices and bring big profits to the company. The 
starting price of a Grand Cherokee, for instance, is $27,490, but the 
SUV can run into the $40,000s when options are added.The full-year profit 
sets the stage for Chrysler to return to the public stock markets.

for Chrysler's union retirees, wants to sell its stake to raise money 
for the payments. Marchionne says a s

said, noting that when he gets his message straight to the people, 
he gets a good reception.Paul said he also picked up support when 
Rick Perry and Herman Cain left the contest."He had a little bit 
more legitimacy about being Tea Party, because he had not been in 
government, and you know, his arguments were a little bit more credible. 
So, our percentages, that's when they took a nice little jump," Paul 
said.But poll numbers do help frame the debate over invincibility, and with 
Romney holding a double-digit lead in Florida, and a strong position in 
national polls, as well as having considerable money in the bank, knocking 
him off his perch will be hard to do.That's why Gingrich has 
repeatedly suggested that Santorum get out of the race, saying that between 
the two of them, they poll better than Romney.But Santorum said that's 
not happening, and Gingrich shouldn't even ask.I don't think people

Department should be taken at face value, Grassley suggested, especially since Holder 
initially denied "gunwalking" had occurred but has since admitted to the operation."Documents 
turned over late Friday night indicate (Criminal Division chief Lanny Breuer) was 
still discussing plans to let guns cross the border with Mexican officials 
on the same day the department denied to me in writing that 
ATF would ever let guns walk," Grassley said."He stood mute as this 
administration fought tooth and nail to keep any of this information from 
coming out for a year.It will take a lot more than a 
knee-jerk defense from their political allies in Congress to restore public trust 
in the leadership of the Justice Department. The American people want to 
see those who failed to act be held accountable," he said.
