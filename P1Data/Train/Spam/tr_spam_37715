 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year
BERLIN  World governments are viewing the death of North Korean leader 
Kim Jong Il with wary optimism -- a possibly destabilizing moment for 
the region as power passes to his son but also an opportunity 
for a new diplomatic start.North Korea's past behavior has been notoriously erratic, 
making it difficult to predict the course it will choose. Japan and 
South Korea quickly held emergency meetings, and world leaders tried to convince 
the isolated country to open up more to the rest of the 
world about its nuclear intentions.Britain's Foreign Secretary William Hague expressed his condolences 
but added "this could be a turning point for North Korea" as 
Kim Jong Un takes over as supreme leader."We hope that their new 
leadership will recognize that engagement with the international community offers the best 
prospect of improving the lives of ordinary North Korean people," Hague said 
in a statement, encouraging the country to resume international talks on its

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent
 eaves the decision up to him -- even though Republicans all along 
had left the final decision up to the president.The stand-off doesn't necessarily 
spell the end of the project by any means. Obama could try 
to buy more time from Congress, or Congress could take it upon 
itself to take a different approach.In a summary of the bill sent 
to House Republicans Saturday, the section on Keystone said that if Obama 
rejects the permit, "Congress will address this issue in the context of 
the next effort to extend" the payroll tax cut and other provisions.Meanwhile, 
the dueling camps over Keystone returned to familiar arguments Saturday as they 
launched what is sure to be a two-month pressure campaign on the 
White House."Now President Obama will have to decide whether he will stand 
with his radical environmental friends and their destructive global warming agenda or 
with a majority of the American people who want to strengthen our 
energy security and create hundreds of th
 were sliding down. I thought I could fight my way back 
up to being in the top three or four," said Gingrich, now 
a front-runner for the nomination. "But I think positive ideas and positive 
solutions... have attracted people. I think they like the idea of someone 
who's determined to be positive."
