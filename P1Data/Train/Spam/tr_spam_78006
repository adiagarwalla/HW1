 (AP)Indianapolis residents dont just have this weekends Super Bowl to be excited 
about, they can also look forward to a visit from the sexiest, 
most successful supermodel in the world  Gisele Bundchen. The Brazil-born beauty 
is married to New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, who will be 
tossing the pigskin there on Sunday against the New York Giants.So what 
can the highest-paid face and figure on planet earth, who jets from 
Paris to to St. Tropez as often as normal people drive from 
home to the Piggly Wiggly, do to entertain herself when she hits 
Indiana's capital?We talked to some locals to find out.Everywhere is going to 
be crazy this weekend, so quiet time is probably out of the 
question. But it will be crazy in a good way, Indiana Fever 
forward Tamika Catchings, who was recently named the 2011 WNBA Most Valuable 
Player, told FOX411s Pop Tarts. If anything, Gisele needs to go down 
to my favorite little jazz spot, Slippery Noodle, I eat there during 
 ring for a terrorist attack. Mohibur Rahman, 27, also from Stoke, admitted 
possessing terror-related material, namely two copies of the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire, 
which contained articles like "Make A Bomb In The Kitchen Of Your 
Mom."Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, senior national coordinator for counterterrorism, issued a 
short statement responding to the guilty pleas."We welcome the guilty pleas entered 
by all nine defendants today [Wednesday], following what was the largest counterterrorism 
operation of 2010," he said. "Our priority is and always will be 
the protection of the public."The suspects were facing a number of terrorism 
charges, including conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life or damage 
property and preparing for acts of terrorism between Nov. 1, 2010, and 
Dec. 21, 2010. They changed their previous not guilty pleas to guilty 
after legal discussion Monday.Police raids on Chowdhury's house in East London turned

et Service agents to protect Romney. Two to three former agents would 
protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection 
if they meet a ser

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APJan. 30, 2012: President Obama meets with Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili in 
the Oval Office of the White House.On the list of countries not 
to confuse with the former Soviet republic of Georgia, Russia is probably 
high up.But President Obama committed the flub on Monday while seated next 
to Georgia's president, Mikheil Saakashvili. Obama quickly corrected himself, avoiding what could 
have perhaps been a more serious diplomatic blunder.The president slipped while discussing 
Georgia's 20th anniversary of independence -- from Soviet Russia."I think Georgia should 
be extraordinarily proud of the progress that is made in building a 
sovereign and democratic country. And one of the first things that I 
did was express my appreciation for the institution-building that's been taking place 
in Russia," Obama said.He paused, and then added, "In Georgia."Saakashvili, who speaks 
English, did not have any visible reaction to the mix-up, and went 
on to praise the Obam
 ReutersNEW YORK  Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer on Tuesday announced a recall of 
some birth control pills in the United States, because they may not 
contain enough contraceptive to prevent pregnancy.Pfizer said the birth control pills posed 
no health threat to women but urged consumers affected by the recall 
to "begin using a non-hormonal form of contraception immediately."The recall involved 14 
lots of Lo/Ovral-28 tablets and 14 lots of Norgestrel and Ethinyl Estradiol 
tablets, which Reuters reported involved about one million packets of birth control 
pills.Pfizer said an investigation found some blister packs of the oral contraceptive 
might contain an inexact count of inert or active ingredients in the 
tablets."As a result of this packaging error, the daily regimen for these 
oral contraceptives may be incorrect and could leave women without adequate contraception, 
and at risk for unintended pregnancy," the company said in a statement 
on its website.The pills wer
NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
