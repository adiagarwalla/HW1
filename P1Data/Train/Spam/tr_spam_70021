 Korea had been a key outstanding demand from both the U.S. 
and South Korea of the North, which has tested two atomic devices 
in the past five years. Recent food talks in Beijing yielded a 
breakthrough on uranium enrichment, the sources said.The food aid announcement, which could 
have come as early as Monday, would have not only been welcome 
news for North Korea, but also pave the way for a crucial 
U.S.-North Korea meeting in Beijing on Thursday. That meeting in turn could 
lead to the resumption of nuclear disarmament talks that would also include 
China, Japan, Russia and South Korea.The so-called six-party talks were last held 
three years ago, and resuming them would amount to a foreign policy 
coup for the Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's 
lone ally China last week to discuss the issues. They were due 
to meet Obama's top national security aides on Monday to discuss the 
way forward. Those meetings will go ahead in the wake of
The Obama administration is ignoring a petition forgery scandal unfolding in South 
Bend, Ind., a former top state elections official  now a U.S. 
congressman -- alleged Sunday, claiming he's still awaiting a response to a 
letter he's written to U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder about the case.Republican 
Rep. Todd Rokita, who served eight years -- from 2002 to 2010 
-- as Indiana's secretary of state, told Fox News that he has 
not received a response from Holder on either charges of election fraud 
in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary in his state or other issues 
of election integrity."We have to involve U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. That's 
why I have written a letter to him, he has yet to 
respond to it, about this case. There are federal crimes for interfering 
with a federal election so he has jurisdiction. They are turning their 
heads on this and the ACORN cases that I brought to him," 
Rokita charged.A criminal investigation is now underway by St. Jo
SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous 
in photos and video from recent trips to China and Russia and 
in numerous trips around the country carefully documented by state media. The 
communist country's "Dear Leader" -- reputed to have had a taste for

facing questions about his handling of the 2008 complaint.Rosamilia, the Clinton County 
youth services chief, said he had informed Raykovitz's wife in November 2008 
that his office was terminating its relationship with The Second Mile because 
of an abuse complaint. He said he had not identified the target 
of that complaint, but that Genovese eventually guessed correctly that it was 
Sandusky.Rosamilia, who said he mentioned his conversation with Genovese to investigators working 
on the current prosecution, also recalled Genovese saying that a member of 
The Second Mile board planned to speak with Sandusky about staying away 
from Second Mile events involving children.Raykovitz said Rosamilia's description of the conversation 
with his wife is incorrect. He would not elaborate. Attempts to reach 
Genovese were unsuccessful.Raykovitz referred questions about what he did in 2008 to 
a prior statement,
 from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
As the Iraq war draws to a close, Mitt Romney cautioned in 
an interview on "Fox News Sunday" that President Obama is taking a 
risk by not leaving a residual force in the country to help 
prop up the military."I'm very concerned in this setting. I hope it 
works out," Romney said.The interview, the Republican presidential candidate's first Sunday show 
appearance in more than two years, will be aired this Sunday.The former 
Massachusetts governor warned that the nature of the troop withdrawal could lead 
to "another lesson learned" in Iraq."I think we're going to find that 
this president, by not putting in place a status-of-forces agreement with the 
Iraqi leadership, has pulled our troops out in a precipitous way and 
we should have left 10-, 20-, 30-thousand personnel there to help transition 
to the Iraqi's own military capabilities," Romney said.Obama, in his weekly radio 
address, praised the troops while saying, "Iraq's future will be in the 
hands of its own peopl
