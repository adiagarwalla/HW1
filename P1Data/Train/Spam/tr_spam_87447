 ssociated Press first reported on the failed bomb plot, which involved a 
sophisticated new type of explosive device, on Monday. Rogers said the information 
was leaked as far back as two weeks ago, though the story 
was held until this week.Information continues to stream out about the plot, 
with sources now saying the supposed bomber was actually a U.S. intelligence 
informant who infiltrated Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.But Rogers, aside from 
expressing concern that the Monday reporting halted an ongoing operation, questioned the 
veracity of some of the details still being reported about the operation 
-- without offering specifics. He said the leaks could challenge the U.S. 
relationship with its intelligence partners overseas."These leaks are dangerous and could lead 
to someone's death," he said.Rogers said he's conducting a "preliminary review," and 
questioned whether someone "may be trying to put this in a political 
narrative to help their politics."Other
Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National

have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

The Lovely and Talented Reese WitherspoonOscar winner Reese Witherspoon is already a 
Hollywood legend.Reese Witherspoon's 70-year-old father recently married his 60-year-old lady friend.There's just 
one problem. He never got a divorce from his wife, Reese's mom.Now 
Mary Witherspoon is suing her husband John Witherspoon and the woman he 
married, Tricianne Taylor, for bigamy.In papers filed in Tennessee on Tuesday, Mary 
says that while she and her husband have not lived in the 
same house for over two decades -- she says his issues with 
alcohol and hoarding necessitated her move -- they never divorced, and she 
still loves him.PHOTOS: Reese Witherspoon's baby bump.She also states in the filing 
that her husband, who she fears has early onset dementia, doesn't even 
remember getting remarried.When I confronted my husband, he said he didnt know 
who Tricianne Taylor was, and that he did not remember getting married, 
she said in an affidavit, according to T
rvices of everything in any situation and without any grounds. This is 
a sign of a severe paranoia."Sochi's selection as the host of the 
2014 Winter Games had sparked fears of possible terrorist activity, although no 
attacks have occurred so far. The city is located in the same 
area as Russia's volatile North Caucasus region, which is plagued with near-daily 
violence linked to an Islamist insurgency that spread from Chechnya to neighboring 
areas in the late 1990s.The International Olympic Committee would not comment on 
the specific case at Sochi but said in a statement that "security 
is a top priority for the IOC."Security at the games is the 
responsibility of the local authorities and we have no doubt that the 
Russians will be up to the task," the statement said.___Misha Dzhindzhikhashvili from
