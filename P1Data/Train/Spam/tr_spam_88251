 a stellar start to the year, with many markets recovering a 
large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent 
to 20,333.37. Mainland China's main index in Shanghai also fell 1.2 percent 
to 2,268.08.The improved mood over the global economy helped oil prices track 
higher   benchmark oil for March delivery gained 53 cents to 
$99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
oreclosure rate was one in every 360 properties, compared to one in 
every 634 nationally  the sixth worst in America. Worse still, the 
average sale price for a Florida foreclosed home was less than $120,000, 
which represents $62,000 less than America at-large.While many of those who went 
bust in the foreclosure debacle were speculators and developers, the wreck of 
the construction business, the decline in tourism and the lack of mobility 
for permanent residents has taken a heavy toll. Most notably for political 
purposes, the change has slowed the rate with which Americans were flocking 
to Florida and the rosy outlook of the residents who remained.One other 
big change in Florida since 2008: As both major political parties have 
seen their share of potential voters drop during the recent rise in 
independent voters, Hispanics have become more important in the states GOP. Cuban-Americans, 
the largest Hispanic group in the state, have shown tremendous inter-generatio
en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.

in this operation until those tactics were made public and, as is 
customary, turned to those with supervisory responsibility over the operation in an 
effort to learn the facts."Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, Issa's Senate counterpart in 
the inquiry, said Tuesday that the documents sent to Congress are not 
even 10 percent of those received at the inspector general's office, which 
Holder requested investigate the case last year. Grassley said Congress has only 
received 6,000 pages of documents while the department's inspector general has 80,000 
documents in hand.The department has yet to explain why it is "withholding 
each of those 74,000 pages," Grassley said in a statement that also
