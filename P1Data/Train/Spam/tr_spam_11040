 the GOP, which required the president to sign off on a 
Keystone XL pipeline plan in 60 days or deem it not in 
the U.S. interest.Obama had previously said he would make no decision on 
the Canada-to-Texas pipeline until 2013, allowing him to wait until after next 
November's elections to choose between two Democratic constituencies: unions favoring the project's 
thousands of jobs and environmentalists opposed to its potential pollution and massive 
energy use. Obama initially threatened to kill the payroll tax bill if 
it included the pipeline language but eventually retreated.However, other sweeteners could be 
added if the sides did go to conference.Added to the chaos is 
the complaint from payroll companies, who have already started setting withholding tables 
for next year. If an agreement can't be resolved by the end 
of the year, many will get hit with a payroll tax increase 
on Jan. 1.McConnell offered support for Boehner Sunday. His spokesman, Donald Stewart,

of the American public on how warmly or coldly they feel about 
a particular celeb.Using the scores, Levitt can objectively show that a Kanye-Kim 
Kardashian union would be unfavorable to the extreme.Levitt tells us that Kanye 
West has a positive Q score of 15. The average for personalities 
in the rap and hip hop community among Kanyes peers is an 
18. Thats not terrible. What is bad is his negative Q, which 
is a 58, where the average negative score for the rap community 
is a 40.While his positive rating isnt dreadful his negative is way 
beyond the average for the category, Levitt said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.The last 
time Levitts company ran the numbers on Kim Kardashian was in August, 
before her disasterous 72 day marriage to Kris Humphries further soured the 
public against her.My guess is the numbers would not improve if we 
ran them now, Levitt said. But even in August, Kims likabilit
r the Cold War-era armed conflict ended in a cease-fire.Japanese Prime Minister 
Yoshihiko Noda held an emergency national security council with top Cabinet members 
soon after hearing the news.He "instructed us to be best prepared in 
case of any unexpected development" while top officials meet to discuss the 
situation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura told journalists in Tokyo.Fujimura expressed condolences 
and said Japan hoped Kim's death would not affect the region adversely."First 
of all we hope that this sudden development would not give adverse 
impact on the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula," he said.The 
White House said it was in constant contact with South Korea and 
Japan, but offered no substantive comment on the implications of Kim's death, 
saying only that President Barack Obama "reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment 
to the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our 
close ally, the Republic of Korea."The news jo

fell slightly in early trading and Wall Street was set to open 
lower while South Korea's Kospi index dived nearly 5 percent but later 
recouped some losses to close 3.4 percent lower. Other Asian stock markets 
also fell.Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said Kim's death brings the situation 
to "one of those critical junctures" and "an exceptionally difficult period of 
transition.""It is critical that everybody exercises appropriate calm and restraint in what 
is a important development in terms of the overall stability of the 
region and the security of us all," Rudd said.The International Atomic Energy 
Agency had no immediate comment on how nuclear talks might proceed under 
a new government.In China, a key North Korean ally, Foreign Ministry spokesman 
Ma Zhaoxu called Kim a "great leader" and said China believes the 
North Korean people will "turn their grief into strength
 erican people are tired of that. Frankly, I'm tired of it. On 
the House side we've seen this kind of action before coming out 
of the Senate. It's time to just stop, do our work, resolve 
the differences, and extend this for one year.-- House Speaker John Boehner 
on Meet the Press.The reason President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid 
toyed with the idea of a government shutdown last week was that 
once the government was funded, they would lose leverage over House Republicans 
in the battle over extending the current Social Security tax holiday.In the 
end, fears about precipitating such a crisis after House Republicans had already 
come up with a bipartisan funding plan for the next year led 
the president and Senate Democrats to go along and put through an 
appropriations bill for the remaining 10 months of the current fiscal year.That 
means House Republicans have the rest of this week to joust over 
the issue of the payroll tax holiday, how it will be offset 

President Obama is consulting with allies following the death of North Korean 
dictator Kim Jong Il, whose reported weekend heart attack has catapulted son 
Kim Jong Un to power and could further destabilize the world's most 
isolated nation."This brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has 
seen little change in decades. South Korea's concern is warranted, frankly, because 
an insecure North Korea could well be an even more dangerous North 
Korea," a U.S. official told Fox News."The most likely scenario for regime 
collapse has been the sudden death of Kim. We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.South Korea's military and police were placed on a high 
alert after Kim's death and Lee convened an emergency national security council 
meeting.Nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea as part of a 
decades-long U.S. security agreement with that country. A Defense Departments sp
