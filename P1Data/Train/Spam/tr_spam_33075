Jeff Lucas, PLS, Esq., is a regular contributor to POB Magazine and has written three books on land boundary law, including "The Pincushion Effect." This fall, he's teaching a 7-week "Land Boundary Master Class" in partnership with POB Magazine and HeatSpring. Lucas says, "I'm dedicated to the idea that our profession is stronger when every person is an expert at what they do - this new format gives me a chance to go deeper and really mentor people who want to be experts and leaders in this field."
"Land Boundary Master Class" will start Nov 3rd, 2014. Sarah Harding, publisher of POB and GeoDataPoint, says, "Jeff is one of the most respected voices in our market. To have an opportunity to work with him is exciting and unique." HeatSpring is providing the platform and support for the course in partnership with POB's CE Campus. Brian Hayden, HeatSpring's President, says "We love working with true experts. Projects like this are why I love my job."
