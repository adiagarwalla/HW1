 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

 sexual yearnings are, like skin color, a matter of genetic determination. 
Opponents of the practice argue that sexual interests are mostly attributable to 
behavioral conditioning and personal choice. Obama shares the view that same-gender sexual 
preference is determined at birth.)Practically speaking, Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney 
have identical positions on same-sex marriage since Romney too is a federalist 
on the subject, as he is on many topics. But Obamas expression 
of his feelings on the same-sex subject is significant for proponents, especially 
given the fact that the president has been ardently supportive of same-sex 
relationships in his official policies.For Obama to suggest in his ABC interview 
that the teachings of Jesus, the founder of the faith of more 
than 200 million Americans, support his position on same-sex marriage reveals the 
depth of his support. Obama is opening himself to charges of reckless 
eisegesis from Christians in orde

bomb hit a Syrian military truck shortly after Mood rode by in 
a convoy traveling to the southern city of Daraa, the birthplace of 
the uprising.The relentless violence in the country has brought a cease-fire plan 
brokered by special envoy Kofi Annan to the brink of collapse. The 
U.N said weeks ago that more than 9,000 people had been killed. 
Hundreds more have died since as the conflict has become increasingly militarized, 
with protesters taking up arms or joining forces with army defectors to 
fight a brutal crackdown by regime forces.On Thursday, Annan appealed for calm 
and an end to bloodshed."The Syrian people have already suffered too much," 
Annan said in a statement.Thursday's explosions began about 7:50 a.m. as the 
area was crowded with people going to work or doing morning errands. 
Witnesses said the first explosion attracted curious passers-by, then seconds later, a
