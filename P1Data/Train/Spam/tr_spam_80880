AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior 
U.S. offici
ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
WASHINGTON  Republicans in Congress are flipping the dimmer switch on a 
law that sets new energy-savings standards for light bulbs.They've reached a deal 
to delay until October enforcement of standards that some fear will bring 
about the end of old-style, 100-watt bulbs. GOP lawmakers say they're trying 
to head off more government interference in people's lives.But environmentalists and the 
light bulb industry say the move is not too bright.Language postponing enforcement 
of the light bulb law -- it was set to take effect 
Jan. 1 -- was included in a massive spending bill that funds 
the government through September. The House passed the measure on Friday, with 
approval expected Saturday in the Senate.Rep. Fred Upton, chairman of the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee, said the light bulb delay shows Congress is 
listening to the American people."We heard the message loud and clear," said 
Upton, R-Mich. "Americans don't want government standards determining how th

have to tighten their belts.The incident followed a series of parcel-bombing scares 
claimed by the Italian far-left group Federazione Anarchia Informale (Informal Anarchist Federation) 
this month.On Monday, Rome mayor Gianni Alemanno also received a letter with 
two bullets and a threatening note signed by the Red Brigades, a

specially toys and children's clothes set aside by impoverished parents.Before she left 
the store Tuesday evening, the Indianapolis woman in her mid-40s had paid 
the layaway orders for as many as 50 people. On the way 
out, she handed out $50 bills and paid for two carts of 
toys for a woman in line at the cash register."She was doing 
it in the memory of her husband who had just died, and 
she said she wasn't going to be able to spend it and 
wanted to make people happy with it," Deppe said. The woman did 
not identify herself and only asked people to "remember Ben," an apparent 
reference to her husband.Deepe, who said she's worked in retail for 40 
years, had never seen anything like it."It was like an angel fell 
out of the sky and appeared in our store," she said.Most of
