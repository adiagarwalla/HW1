our generation's most pressing fiscal and economic challenges.""We will not solve this 
problem unless both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are willing to move off 
their fixed positions and find common ground," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Kent Conrad, a Democrat. "Republicans must be willing to put revenue on 
the table."The study also predicts modest economic growth of 2 percent this 
year and forecasts that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent 
this year and next. That is based on an assumption that President 
Barack Obama will fail to win renewal of payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits by the end of next month.That jobless rate is higher 
than the rates that contributed to losses by Presidents Jimmy Carter (7.5 
percent) and George H.W. Bush (7.4 percent). The study predicts unemployment to

APJan. 31, 2012: Director of National Intelligence James Clapper listens to a 
question while testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington.An emboldened Iran is "now 
more willing" to launch an attack inside the United States, America's top 
intelligence official told Congress Tuesday, adding that the global threat posed by 
Al Qaeda's central leadership has been diminished.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper 
outlined what he described as a "critical transition phase for the terrorist 
threat" in testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. With Usama bin Laden 
and many of his former deputies dead, Clapper said the group's leadership 
is thinned, its capabilities "degraded" and its focus on "smaller, simpler plots.""Al 
Qaeda core's ability to perform has weakened significantly," he said.At the same 
time, Clapper described the threat from Iran as one on the upswing. 
In a lengthy document submitted to Congress, Clapper said last year's alleged

and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative

vice president for policy, external affairs and communications at Pfizer Inc., a 
job that includes directing the pharmaceutical giant's government relations operations.California figured most 
prominently on Obama's roster of big money "bundlers." Sixteen are from California 
and 13 are from New York.Top fundraisers include movie producers Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and Harvey Weinstein, and Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour. Actress Eva Longoria was 
in the second highest tier, bundling $200,000 to $500,000 for Obama's re-election.

executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally,
