SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress

national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.
