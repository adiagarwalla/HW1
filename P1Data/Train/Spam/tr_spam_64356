YMCA
 Yogis, gymnasts, or those looking for a rush will delight in the challenges of this invigorating position. Based on a classic yoga move called the Headstand, or Shirshasana, this pose has as many health benefits as it does pleasurable ones; as you invert the body, you breathe deeper, improve circulation, and relieve stress on the lower back. 
The inverting partner will kneel and place the top of their head on a small floor cushion between the seated partner's thighs. Next, straighten the knees, http://www.xahoiso.vn/rebirths raise the hips, and keep the abs flexed. The seated partner can now assist the other in entering the final pose and arrange themselves accordingly. 
When first entering this position, mild breathing difficulties may be experienced as the blood from the body rushes to the head; this should quickly pass, but if you're feeling uncomfortable, come out of the position and rest in a prone position to normalize circulation before standing up again.
