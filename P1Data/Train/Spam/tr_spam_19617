<p style="font-size:xx-small;">nside Pakistan, an acknowledgement of U.S. policy.At Tuesday's White House press briefing, 
reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to 
discuss broadly or specifically supposed covert programs."A senior defense official who spoke 
to Fox News on the condition of anonymity, pointed out that the 
president was careful not to mention the Central Intelligence Agency's involvement in 
the program."He came close to crossing a line," this official said, "but 
he didn't say who conducts these missions."The CIA has never acknowledged publicly 
that they in fact carry out the strikes, but officials speaking on 
background have done so repeatedly. The U.S. military has long said it 
has no drone operation over Pakistan.Although Pakistan's government has complained these strikes 
violate its sovereignty, Obama claimed thi
 ful of non-binding contests this month, where the conservative yin and yang, 
Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or 
less and those with grad
 al food aid to North Korea since Lee took office in 2008, 
saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.
