n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

a year. Without support from other investors, Muller's plans didn't seem credible, 
critics said.Concerns mounted as Saab failed to pay suppliers early this year. 
Production was stopped in March, restarted, then halted again as the liquidity 
crisis deepened.
APFaeirouz Elbergwa was among an elite group of Libyans selected by the 
family of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi to come to the U.S. for 
a two-year diplomatic training program.EAST LANSING, Mich.  More than two years 
ago, Faeirouz Elbergwa was among a select group of Libyans sent by 
her government to an American university to train for the nation's diplomatic 
corps. As she prepares for the final stage of her studies, she 
and her colleagues now find themselves in an odd state of limbo 
-- a vestige of a regime that no longer exists and unsure 
what might await them in their much-changed homeland.Elbergwa, 27, and 18 colleagues 
in a Libyan diplomatic training program at Michigan State University watched in 
amazement during the last year as the North African nation was convulsed 
by a violent revolution that ended with the overthrow and death of 
leader Muammar Qaddafi.When the regime fell, many of the students were elated. 
Elbergwa said she and her family "took the

Jones, a computer science professor at the University of Iowa who has 
consulted for both political parties, said the Iowa Republican Party is right 
to be concerned about the security of their computer systems. The Internet, 
he said, is "becoming more and more like the Wild West.""It's very 
clear the data consolidation and data gathering from the caucuses, which determines 
the headlines the next morning, who might withdraw or resign from the 
process, all of that is fragile," Jones said. "If I were one 
of these `hacktivists' who had no scruples, I would be really strongly 
tempted to see if I could get into the computer and see 
if I could make `SpongeBob SquarePants' win."

emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was

deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA,
