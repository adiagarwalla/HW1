"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
should be telling other folks to get out of the race and 
get out of my way. If you want to run a race, 
run a race, you don't ask someone to quit just because because 
you think you're the better candidate. I think I'm the better candidate 
but Newt has every right to run," he said.

won," the former Pennsylvania senator told Fox News, speaking from Sioux Falls, 
S.D., where he held a quick event after being in Laverne, Minn., 
the night before.Minnesota holds its primary next week and will award 40 
delegates. Missouri has a primary next week but its 52 delegates aren't 
selected until caucuses in a month. Nevada has its caucuses this weekend 
and 28 delegates to allocate. Colorado's caucuses, which award 36 delegates, are 
next week.By all accounts, even if Romney were to seal the deal 
optically with a victory in Florida, he won't win 1,144 delegates -- 
50 percent plus one -- to secure the nomination until at least 
April.Santorum noted that Tuesday's vote in Florida is only the fourth of 
more than 50 to be had, if one's counting the four U.S. 
territories, which have nine delegates each. He said all of them will

meeting on the situation in Syria at United Nations headquarters.Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton, facing resistance from Russia, appealed to the United Nations Tuesday 
to support an Arab League-backed resolution that calls for Syrian President Bashar 
Assad to step down.In a forceful plea at a meeting of the 
U.N. Security Council, Clinton voiced confidence in the prospects for a political 
transition in Syria. But she suggested the death toll would rise considerably 
if the international community does not apply more pressure soon."We all know 
that change is coming to Syria. Despite its ruthless tactics, the Assad 
regime's reign of terror will end and the people of Syria will 
have a chance to chart their own destiny," she said. "The question 
for us is how many more innocent civilians will die before this 
country is able to move forward."Clinton said nations have a choice --
