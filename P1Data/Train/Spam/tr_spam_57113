I unfortunately feel obligated to write this review because we had such high hopes for our experience at this restaurant and it didn't turn out as expected. 

What a charming place though. 5944264 It was bustling with very happy people and we didn't wait long for a place to have a few drinks before sitting down for dinner. There is a drink on the bar menu that I can honestly say is my absolute favorite drink ever. I think it was the Blu-52 or something. It's more sour and tart than normal fru-fru drinks, and soooo perfect for the season! Excellent bar experience. 

We ordered a few appetizers as we enjoyed our drinks. 5944264 The first was some sort of tuna and butter bean salad. Absolutely refreshing and fits the definition of an appetizer: you have it and start to really crave more food. There was one plate that stands out in my memory in a bad way. It was broccoli with duck egg and somehow classified as another salad. Salads should  have dressing, and this didn't. The dish really didn't come together at all, and we were surprised at its presentation. The so-called duck egg really seemed like a regular egg (I'm married to a chef, so I should know these things), and it just wasn't thought-out at all. My tartar was good, but it was served with a potato item that was overly-burnt and overpowering in flavor against the tartar. I didn't enjoy it, and the rye bread that our server brought out was also burned on the bottom.5567ba99823dc754ad83daa7627e21f7
