times.  19415669 creativity of flavors, 19415669 excellent execution, and 19415669 service was great.  Mesa is located just off 19415669 casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance. 19415669 flip side however is 19415669 feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of . 19415669 food is delicious.  We had 19415669 queso fundido, 19415669 chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall 19415669 last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off 19415669 plate. We felt 19415669 price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend. PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.  We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From 19415669 service, to 19415669 ambiance, to 19415669 food,
