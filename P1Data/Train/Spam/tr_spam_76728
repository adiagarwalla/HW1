		 suggestion of burnt taste.) Between 11949645 perfect cheese, 11949645 crunch, 11949645 light layer of mushrooms that didn't dominate 11949645 dish, and 11949645 yummy dollops of cream on top of each quarter-slice, how is there any praise left for 11949645 fried egg on top? Oh, but there must be, because this was genius. 11949645 fried egg just added a very simple "edge" to 11949645 quesadilla's taste without interfering with any of 11949645 flavours already going on. My stomach was full and my heart was broken that I couldn't eat my last three bites, but we did have main courses coming. Gah! (Next time I'll just get a starter and dessert and skip 11949645 corn muffin. There was absolutely no room for any of 11949645 exciting dessert options on this trip.) Mike had ordered 11949645 Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which are an interpretation of satay sticks with tortillas and peanut-chile sauce. (I'll let him talk these up in his own review.) I ordered 11949645 only vegetarian item in 11949645 "main dish" section: 11949645 Cornmeal-Crusted Chile Relleno. (Note: there are more vegetarian appetizers.) Often I find chile rellenos too greasy or samey or gloopy, but they can be good. I wanted to see what Flay's people would do. Short version: it was 11949645 best chile relleno I've had in my life... and I say this even though I thought 11949645 cornmeal coat was absolutely bland if not a bit yucky. (If there was any seasoning, I couldn't taste it.) But once I peeled that back, 11949645 chile itself (and all 11949645 complex cheesy yumness inside) was delicious. With 11949645 herbs on top and drizzled sauces underneath, every bite was just as intriguing and new as with 11949645 quesadilla. Yelp says I'm out of characters, so I'll just say this: Michelin needs to bring back 11949645 Las Vegas guide and bring back Bobby's star. We sat at 11949645 bar for a few minutes while we waited for our table.  They have an excellent selection of quality licquors.  I was happy to see a good assortment of whiskeys. We started off 11949645 meal with 11949645 Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It was excellent.  By far 11949645 best queso fundido I have had maybe ever. They bring a good variety of bread to 11949645 table.  I am partial to 11949645 cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in. For my entree I chose 11949645 Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  11949645 meat was tender, and 11949645 sauce added great flavor.  Even 11949645 toasted cous cous was tasty. This place is always busy.  Book your reservations several days in advance if you have a specific time in mind. i expected more from bobby.  :(  i'm a brunch lover, and when i saw 11949645 brunch items available on his menu, i was excited to eat.  i got 11949645 chilaquiles, and my bf got 11949645 spicy chicken & sweet potato hash. firstly, 11949645 great part - his sauces are DELISH.  11949645 chilaquiles were NOT chilaquiles.  too deconstructed.  sort of made it hard to eat and ruined it more me.  it was two blue corn tostadas with melted cheese between them and
