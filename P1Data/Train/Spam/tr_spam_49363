<p style="font-size:xx-small;">esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing 
report
 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
 f our competencies," Rominger said. "We wanted to pull in all the 
supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe
