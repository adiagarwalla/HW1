<font color="white" size="1">sters had thronged the streets shortly after authorities withdrew tanks from Homs, 
in the first sign the regime was complying with the League's plan 
to end the 9-month-old crackdown against dissent.After agreeing to the League's pullback 
plan on Dec 19, the regime intensified its crackdown on dissent; government 
troops killed hundreds in the past week and Syria was condemned internationally 
for flouting the spirit of the agreement.The U.N. says more than 5,000 
people have been killed since March in the political violence across Syria.December 
27, 2011: This image made from amateur video and released by Shaam 
News Network purports to show men carrying an injured man in Homs, 
Syria.

claims it has sonar-evading submarines designed for shallow waters of the Persian 
Gulf, enabling it to hit passing enemy vessels.A closure of the strait 
could temporarily cut off some oil supplies and force shippers to take 
longer, more expensive routes that would drive oil prices higher. It also 
potentially opens the door for a military confrontation that would further rattle 
global oil markets.Iran claimed a victory this month when it captured an 
American surveillance drone almost intact. It went public with its possession of 
the RQ-170 Sentinel to trumpet the downing as a feat of Iran's 
military in a complicated technological and intelligence battle with the U.S.American officials 
have said that U.S. intelligence assessments indicate the drone malfunctioned.
