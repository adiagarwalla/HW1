Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last

Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane

authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nanswered Friday.Gao has been held incommunicado in apparent disregard of laws and 
regulations for all but two months of the last three years. When 
he emerged from the first 14-month bout in April 2010, he told 
The Associated Press that he had been shunted between detention centers, farm 
houses and apartments across north China and repeatedly beaten and abused.He said 
he had been hooded several times. His captors made him sit motionless 
for up to 16 hours and threatened to kill him and dump 
his body in a river."'You must forget you're human. You're a beast,"' 
Gao said police told him in September 2009.At one point, six plainclothes 
officers bound him with belts and put a wet towel around his 
face for an hour, bringing on a feeling of slow suffocation."It's hard 
to fathom what they might be referring to when they say that 
he violated his parole given that he seems to have been under 
constant supervision," said Joshua Rosenzweig, a human rights researcher based 
 e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said 
winter cold could test their strength.
APJune 15, 2011: WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is seen with his ankle 
security tag at the house where he is required to stay in, 
near Bungay, England.LONDON -- Britain's Supreme Court said Friday it had agreed 
to hear WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange's appeal against extradition to Sweden over 
sex crimes allegations.The court said a panel of three judges had considered 
a written submission and granted a two-day appeal beginning on Feb. 1, 
meaning there is no prospect of Assange being sent to Stockholm until 
at least next year.In a statement, the court said it had "decided 
that seven justices will hear the appeal given the great public importance 
of the issue raised, which is whether a prosecutor is a judicial 
authority."Assange's legal team argue that police and prosecutors -- like the Swedish 
prosecutor seeking to bring Assange back to the country for questioning -- 
are not a proper judicial authority, and shouldn't have the right to 
order extraditions.Ear
