		 lay so happily until digestion took its course and brought it out to reality. My last experience here was just short of two nights ago. I went with my Human Garbage Disposal. He was very excited to try Mesa Grill because he is a fan of Bobby Flay and I was enthusing about 2819279 infamous melt in your mouth rib eye. I ordered another fish- 2819279 grouper. Our food arrived, I looked at 2819279 huge rib-eye enviously and looked at my petite grouper. Whatever right? As soon as I took a bite out of 2819279 grouper, I pretty much dismissed all theatrics of 2819279 rib-eye and deemed 2819279 grouper 2819279 best dish I could ask for from Mesa Grill. So flavorful, so colorful, so tasty! And maybe it was my imagination, but 2819279 rib eye that I stole a bite from did not melt in my mouth. Dear grouper fish, never become extinct. And may Bobby Flay's minion chefs continue cooking you.  Customer Service from 2819279 time we walked in ticked me off. No need to have their nose up in 2819279 air with folks in town for a conference. So that was my initial impression. 2819279 Host was very crude upon us entering 2819279 restaurant with a laptop case & INSISTED, we couldn't take it to 2819279 dining room. Which is totally fine, but no need to bite our heads off. Just tell us where to put it! Our server must have been new or just a chatter box, but it took him about 10+ mins to go through 2819279 menu (which isn't very big in 2819279 first place) ps. Have a mint! Food: Corn Soup was darn good (my co-worker ordered that). I had 2819279 grilled Asparagus salad which was nice & refreshing. For my meal i had 2819279 tiger shrimp tamale. I gotta say, A+! sooo yummy! 2819279 tamale itself was perfectly made, 2819279 taste was very light & 2819279 fresh corn--YUM! Ohh 2819279 fries - another great treat. Dessert - Coconut cake - HOLY MOLY, light, fresh, not tooo sweet, but just darn good!  It's a little overpriced for 2819279 type of food you get, but then again, what do you expect with Bobby Flay's name stamped on 2819279 product and it being situated at 2819279 heart of Las Vegas.  All appetizers ranged from $11-16, and entrees from $30-50.  I had 2819279 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin.  this was served with Bourbon-Ancho Chile Sauce and a sweet potato tamale with pecan butter ($36).  OMFG.  It was pretty damn good.  Pork was cooked perfectly...medium.  Nice crust on 2819279 outside, tender on 2819279 inside.  2819279 sweet potato tamale was delicious.  It reminded me of a new take on cornbread.  My husband ordered 2819279 Sixteen Spice Crusted Chicken ($32).  This was accompanied by a mango-garlic sauce and mango salsa.  2819279 chicken was very tender-not dry at all.  And 2819279 mango sauce and salsa went perfectly well with 2819279 chicken. Mesa
