        1. I think you'd better call it =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, rather =
than =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF.
        2. A =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF should be combined by 4 or 8 verses=
. We can't simply judge if a single line is good or not.
        3. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. No. The subjec=
t is changed, you can't just omit what is changed. Unless you meant =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        4. It may only make sense under some particular context. That's why =
we need the other parts.=20

        What kinda of poem are you writing?

        Is it classical metrical poem or free verse?

        For classical Chinese metrical poem, it must follow strict poetic me=
ter, which is very like English poetic meter.=20

        Thanks guys,
        it is really my very first try at writing in verse. It grew up from =
a single verse that just got stuck in my head and is not following any forma=
l rules since I don't k
now anything about these rules. The line I gave is a part of the two line m
otif/theme. I really hope it doesn't offend anyone, offence is not my intend=

=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF ('Coming to Guangzhou' is in Guangdong) does =

=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is okay though.

=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF are virtually two sentences. So maybe you want to break it d=
own into two lines too. Otherwise you may need to change the thing you
 want to express completely.=20

        1. I think you'd better call it =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF, rather =
than =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF.
        2. A =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF should be combined by 4 or 8 verses=
. We can't simply judge if a single line is good or not.
        3. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF. No. The subjec=
t is changed, you can't just omit what is changed. Unless you meant =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
        4. It may only make sense under some particular context. That's why =
we need the other parts.=20

        What kinda of poem are you writing?

        Is it classical metrical poem or free verse?

        For classical Chinese metrical poem, it must follow strict poetic me=
ter, which is very like English poetic meter.=20

        Thanks guys,
        it is really my very first try at writing in verse. It grew up from =
a single verse that just got stuck in my head and is not following any forma=
l rules since I don't k
now anything about these rules. The line I gave is a part of the two line m
otif/theme. I really hope it doesn't offend anyone, offence is not my intend=
, just a silly exercise in writing Chinese. It goes like this: =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FFAs I
 said the thing is not meant to offend it is more in the spirit of =FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FFJust wonder if the meaning of the first part is clear to a Chine=
se person.=20

=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF ('Coming to Guangzhou' is in Guangdong) does =
not make much sense, even with the context. =FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=
=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF=FF is okay though.

 want to express completely.=20
