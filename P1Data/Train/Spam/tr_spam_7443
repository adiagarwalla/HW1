Another method which has been proposed is to run the liquid[Pg 12] olein ove=
r a series of electrically charged plates, which effects its ction to st=
earin.

Stearic acid is also formed by treating oleic acid with fuming hydriodic aci=
d in the presence of phosphorus, while other solid acids are obtained by the=
 action of sulphuric acid or zinc chloride on ol
eic acid.

Acids of Series II. may also be converted into saturated acids by heating to=
 300=FF.C. with solid caustic potash, which decomposes them into acids of th=
e stearic series with liberation of hydrogen. This
 reaction, with oleic acid, for example, is generally represented by the equ=
ation.=FF=FF

C18H34O2 + 2KOH =3D KC2H3O2 + KC16H31O2 + H2,

though it must be really more complex than this indicates, for, as Edmed has=
 pointed out, oxalic acid is also formed in considerable quantity. The proce=
ss on a commercial scale has now been abandoned.

One of the most important properties of this group of acids is the formation=
 of isomeric acids of higher melting point on treatment with nitrous acid, g=
enerally termed the elaidin reaction. Oleic acid
, for example, acted upon by nitrous acid, yields elaidic acid, melting at 4=
5=FF., and erucic acid gives brassic acid, melting at 60=FF.C. This reaction=
 also occurs with the neutral glycerides of these ac
ids, olein being converted into elaidin, which melts at 32=FF.C.

The lead salts of the acids of this series are much more soluble in ether, a=
nd the lithium salts more soluble in alcohol than those of the stearic serie=
s, upon both of which properties processes have=20
been based for the separation of the solid from the liquid fatty acids.

III. Linolic Series:.=FF=FF
Acid.    Formula.    Melting Point, =FF.C.    Found in
El.=FFomargaric    C16H29COOH    ...    Chinese-wood oil.
El.=FFostearic    C16H29COOH    71    Chinese-wood oil.
Linolic    C17H31COOH    Fluid    Linseed, cotton-seed and maize oils.
Tariric    C17H31COOH    50.5    Tariri-seed oil.
Telfairic    C17H31COOH    Fluid    Telfairia oil.

These acids readily combine with bromine, iodine, or oxygen. They are unaffe=
cted by nitrous acid, and their lead salts are soluble in ether.

IV. Linolenic Series:.=FF=FF
Acid.    Formula.    Found in
Linolenic    C17H29COOH    Linseed oil.
Isolinolenic    C17H29COOH    Linseed oil.
Jecoric    C17H29COOH    Cod-liver and marine animal oils.

[Pg 13]

These acids are similar in properties to those of Class III., but combine wi=
th six atoms of bromine or iodine, whereas the latter combine with only four=
 atoms.

V. Ricinoleic Series:.=FF=FF
Acid.    Formula.    Melting Point, =FF.C.    Found in
Ricinoleic    C17H22(OH)COOH    4-5    Castor oil.

This acid combines with two atoms of bromine or iodine, and is converted by =
nitrous acid into the isomeric ricinelaidic acid, which melts at 52=FF.-53=FF=
. C. Pure ricinoleic acid, obtained from castor oil
, is optically active, its rotation being .=FFd +6=FF. 25'.

Hydrolysis or Saponification of Oils and Fats..=FF=FFThe decomposition of a =
triglyceride, brought about by caustic alkalies in the formation of soap, th=
ough generally represented by the equation already g
iven (pp. 6 and 7).=FF=FF

C3H5(OR) + 3NaOH =3D C3H5(OH)3 + 3RONa,

is not by any means such a simple reaction.

In the first place, though in this equation no water appears, the presence o=
f the latter is found to be indispensable for saponification to take place; =
in fact, the water must be regarded as actually=20
decomposing the oil or fat, caustic soda or potash merely acting as a cataly=
tic agent. Further, since in the glycerides there are three acid radicles to=
 be separated from glycerol, their saponificatio
n can be supposed to take place in three successive stages, which are the co=
nverse of the formation of mono- and diglycerides in the synthesis of trigly=
cerides from fatty acids and glycerine. Thus, th
e above equation may be regarded as a summary of the following three:.=FF=FF=

        {    OR    {    OH
(i.)    C3H5    {    OR + NaOH =3D C3H5    {    OR + RONa
        {    OR    {    OR



        {    OH    {    OH
(ii.)    C3H5    {    OR + NaOH =3D C3H5    {    OR + RONa
        {    OR    {    OH



        {    OH    {    OH
(iii.)    C3H5    {    OR + NaOH =3D C3H5    {    OH + RONa
        {    OH    {    OH

Geitel and Lewkowitsch, who have studied this question from the physical and=
 chemical point of view respectively, are of opinion that[Pg 14] when an oil=
 or fat is saponified, these three reactions do=20
actually occur side by side, the soap-pan containing at the same time unsapo=
nified triglyceride, diglyceride, monoglyceride, glycerol and soap.

This theory is not accepted, however, by all investigators. Balbiano and Mar=
cusson doubt the validity of Lewkowitsch's conclusions, and Fanto, experimen=
ting on the saponification of olive oil with cau
stic potash, is unable to detect the intermediate formation of any mono- or =
diglyceride, and concludes that in homogeneous solution the saponification i=
s practically quadrimolecular. Kreeman, on the o
ther hand, from physico-chemical data, supports the view of Geitel and Lewko=
witsch that saponification is bimolecular, and though the evidence seems to =
favour this theory, the matter cannot be regarde
d as yet definitely settled.

Hydrolysis can be brought about by water alone, if sufficient time is allowe=
d, but as the process is extremely slow, it is customary in practice to acce=
lerate the reaction by the use of various method
s, which include (i.) the application of heat or electricity, (ii.) action o=
f enzymes, and (iii.) treatment with chemicals; the accelerating effect of t=
he two latter methods is due to their emulsifyin
g power.

The most usual method adopted in the manufacture of soap is to hydrolyse the=
 fat or oil by caustic soda or potash, the fatty acids liberated at the same=
 time combining with the catalyst, i.e., soda or
 potash, to form soap. Hitherto the other processes of hydrolysis have been =
employed chiefly for the preparation of material for candles, for which purp=
ose complete separation of the glycerol in the f
irst hydrolysis is not essential, since the fatty matter is usually subjecte=
d to a second treatment with sulphuric acid to increase the proportion of so=
lid fatty acids. The colour of the resulting fat
ty acids is also of no importance, as they are always subjected to distillat=
ion.

During the last few years, however, there has been a growing attempt to firs=
t separate the glycerol from the fatty acids, and then convert the latter in=
to soap by treatment with the carbonates of soda
 or potash, which are of course considerably cheaper than the caustic alkali=
es, but cannot be used in the actual saponification of a neutral fat. The tw=
o processes chiefly used for this purpose are th
ose in which the reaction is brought about by enzymes or by Twitchell's reag=
ent.

I. Application of Heat or Electricity..=FF=FFUp to temperatures of 150=FF. C=
. the effect of water on oils and fats is very slight, but by passing super=
heated steam through fatty matter heated to 200=FF.-300=FF.
 C. the neutral glycerides are completely decomposed into glycerol and fatty=
 acids according to the equation.=FF=FF

C3H5(OR)3 + 3H.OH =3D C3H5(OH)3 + 3ROH.

The fatty acids and glycerol formed distil over with the excess of steam, an=
d by arranging a series of condensers, the former, which condense first, are=
 obtained almost alone in the earlier ones, and=20
an aqueous solution of glycerine in the later ones. This method of preparati=
on of fatty acids is extensively used in France for the production[Pg 15] of=
 stearine for candle-manufacture, but the result
ing product is liable to be dark coloured, and to yield a dark soap. To expo=
se the acids to heat for a minimum of time, and so prevent discoloration, Ma=
nnig has patented (Germ. Pat. 160,111) a process
 whereby steam under a pressure of 8 to 10 atmospheres is projected against =
a baffle plate mounted in a closed vessel, where it mixes with the fat or oi=
l in the form of a spray, the rate of hydrolysis
 being thereby, it is claimed, much increased.

Simpson (Fr. Pat. 364,587) has attempted to accelerate further the decomposi=
tion by subjecting oils or fats to the simultaneous action of heat and elect=
ricity. Superheated steam is passed into the oil
, in which are immersed the two electrodes connected with a dynamo or batter=
y, the temperature not being allowed to exceed 270=FF. C.

II. Action of Enzymes..=FF=FFIt was discovered by Muntz in 1871 (Annales de =
Chemie, xxii.) that during germination of castor seeds a quantity of fatty a=
cid was developed in the seeds, which he suggested m
ight be due to the decomposition of the oil by the embryo acting as a fermen=
t. Schutzenberger in 1876 showed that when castor seeds are steeped in water=
, fatty acids and glycerol are liberated, and at
tributed this to the hydrolytic action of an enzyme present in the seeds. No=
 evidence of the existence of such a ferment was adduced, however, till 1890=
, when Green (Roy. Soc. Proc., 48, 370) definite
ly proved the presence in the seeds of a ferment capable of splitting up the=
 oil into fatty acid and glycerol.

The first experimenters to suggest any industrial application of this enzymi=
c hydrolysis were Connstein, Hoyer and Wartenburg, who (Berichte, 1902, 35, =
pp. 3988-4006) published the results of a length
y investigation of the whole subject. They found that tallow, cotton-seed, p=
alm, olive, almond, and many other oils, were readily hydrolysed by the cast=
or-seed ferment in the presence of dilute acid,=20
but that cocoa-nut and palm-kernel oils only decomposed with difficulty. The=
 presence of acidity is essential for the hydrolysis to take place, the most=
 suitable strength being one-tenth normal, and t
he degree of hydrolysis is proportional to the quantity of ferment present. =
Sulphuric, phosphoric, acetic or butyric acids, or sodium bisulphate, may be=
 used without much influence on the result. Buty
ric acid is stated to be the best, but in practice is too expensive, and ace=
tic acid is usually adopted. The emulsified mixture should be allowed to sta=
nd for twenty-four hours, and the temperature sh
ould not exceed 40=FF. C.; at 50=FF. C. the action is weakened, and at 100=FF=
. C. ceases altogether.
