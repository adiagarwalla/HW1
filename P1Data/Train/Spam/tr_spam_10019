The following is a simple way for tarring sheet-iron pipes to prevent rustin=
g. The sections as made should be coated with coal tar, and then filled with=
 light wood shavings, and the latter set alight. The effect of this treatmen=
t will be to render the iron practically proof against rust for an indefinit=
e period, rendering future painting unnecessary. It is important, of course,=
 that the iron should not be made too hot, or kept hot for too long a time, =
lest the tar should be burnt off.

The following is a varnish for iron and steel given by a recognized authorit=
y: 5 parts of camphor and elemi, 15 parts of sandarach, and 10 parts of clea=
r grains of mastic, are dissolved in the requisite quantity of alcohol, and =
applied cold.

Another good black enamel for small articles can be made by mixing 1 lb. of =
asphaltum with 1 lb. of resin in 4 lb. of tar oil, well heating the whole in=
 an iron vessel before applying.

A good brown japan can be prepared by separately heating equal quantities of=
 amber and asphaltum, and adding to each one-half the quantity by weight of =
boiled linseed oil. Both compounds are then mixed together. Copal resin may =
be substituted for the amber, but it is not so durable. Oil varnish made fro=
m amber is highly elastic. If it is used to protect tin-plate printing, when=
 the plates after stoving have been subsequently rolled so as to distort the=
 letters, the varnish has in no way suffered, and its surface remains unbrok=
en.

A bronzing composition for coating iron consists of 120 parts mercury, 10 pa=
rts tin, 20 parts green vitriol, 120 parts water, and 15 parts hydrochloric =
acid of 1.2 specific gravity.
SECTION VI.
PROCESSES FOR TIN-PLATING.

In these days of making everything look what it is not, perhaps the best and=
 cheapest substitute for silver as a white coating for table ware, culinary =
vessels, and the many articles requiring such a coating, is pure tin. It doe=
s not compare favourably with silver in point of hardness or wearing qualiti=
es, but it costs very much less than silver, is readily applied, and can be =
easily kept clean and bright. In tinning hollow ware on the inside the metal=
 article is first thoroughly cleansed by pickling it in dilute muriatic or s=
ulphuric acid and then scouring it with fine sand. It is then heated over a =
fire to about the melting-point of tin, sprinkled with powdered resin, and p=
artly filled with melted pure grain tin covered with resin to prevent its ox=
idation. The vessel is then quickly turned and rolled about in every directi=
on, so as to bring every part of the surface to be covered in contact with t=
he molten metal. The greater part of the tin is then thrown out and the surf=
ace rubbed over with a brush of tow to equalize the coating; and if not sati=
sfactory the operation must be repeated. The vessels usually tinned in this =
manner are of copper and brass, but with a little care in cleaning and manip=
ulating, iron can also be satisfactorily tinned by this means. The vessels t=
o be tinned must always be sufficiently hot to keep the metal contained in t=
hem thoroughly fused. This is covering by contact with melted tin.

The amalgam process is not so much used as it was formerly. It consists in a=
pplying to the clean and dry metallic surface a film of a pasty amalgam of t=
in with mercury, and then exposing the surface to heat, which volatilizes th=
e latter, leaving the tin adhering to the metal.

The immersion process is the best adapted to coating articles of brass or co=
pper. When immersed in a hot solution of tin properly prepared the metal is =
precipitated upon their surfaces. One of the best solutions for this purpose=
 is the following:=FF=FF
Ammonia alum    171/4 oz.
Boiling    121/2 lb.
Protochloride of tin    1 oz.

The articles to be tinned must be first thoroughly cleansed, and then kept i=
n the hot solution until properly whitened. A better result will be obtained=
 by using the following bath, and placing the pieces in contact with a strip=
 of clean zinc, also immersed:=FF=FF
Bitartrate of potassium    14    oz.
Soft water    24     "
Protochloride of tin    1     "

It should be boiled for a few minutes before using.

The following is one of the best solutions for plating with tin by the batte=
ry process:=FF=FF
Potassium pyrophosphate    12    oz.
Protochloride of tin    41/2     "
Water    20     "

The anode or feeding-plate used in this bath consists of pure Banca tin. Thi=
s plate is joined to the positive (copper or carbon) pole of the battery, wh=
ile the work is suspended from a wire connected with the negative (zinc) pol=
e. A moderately strong battery is required, and the work is finished by scra=
tch-brushing.
