on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and 
sent debris tumbling down the side of the mountain, leaving a giant

he has "the same view on marriage that I had when I 
was governor and that I expressed many times. I believe marriage is 
between a man and a woman."Before heading to Hollywood, Obama will also 
hold fundraisers earlier in the day Thursday in Seattle, where he was 
expected to collect at least $3 million toward his re-election effort. On 
Friday, he will fly to Nevada, a highly contested state, where he 
will call for housing relief in a speech in Reno.But Obama's support 
of gay marriage will be dominant, culminating in yet another fundraiser Monday 
in New York sponsored by gay and Latino Obama supporters.Even though Obama 
doesn't have the power to make same-sex marriage legal, his announcement was 
the first by a sitting president.As much as his announcement may energize 
his core backers, however, gay marriage remains enough of a divisive issue 
that there could be political risks. If opposition to gay marriage drives 
even a sliver of the voting population, it could

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">e space agency now relies on Russian Soyuz rockets and spacecraft to 
ferry astronauts to and from the space station until commercial alternatives in 
the U.S. become available. NASA hopes that happens by 2017.The agency pays 
approximately $63 million per seat on Soyuz flights. But the Liberty system 
is designed to be more cost-effective, Rominger said. He did not disclose 
the projected price per seat, but did say it will be "significantly 
less than what we're paying the Russians today."Partnerships in commercial spaceThe Liberty 
system is being built in partnership with Astrium, whose Ariane 5 rocket 
has served as Europe's primary booster for launching satellites and spacecraft into 
orbit."One of the very exciting aspects of this program is having proven 
teams that have really worked on complex programs in various ways together," 
said John Schumacher, CEO of Astrium in North America. "This is the 
commercial industry coming together to provide a capability built 
  both.Those states, several of them battlegrounds in November, are worth a 
total of 309 electoral votes in the presidential general election -- it 
takes 270 to win.Senior officials said they're not sure how the announcement 
Wednesday will play politically, but they downplayed the idea that it would 
depress turnout among black voters. They plan on demonstrating a stark contrast 
with presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the issue.Conservatives meanwhile pilloried Obama 
on Wednesday, with former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum accusing the president 
of putting on a "charade" all this time."The charade is now over, 
no doubt an attempt to galvanize his core hard left supporters in 
advance of the November election," Santorum said.Romney, asked about the president's statements, 
said that his view remains the same. "I believe that marriage is 
a relationship between a man and a woman," he said. "States are 
able to make decisions with regards to domesti
eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that
