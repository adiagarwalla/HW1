still brewing in parts of the world today, and we all cant 
keep turning a blind eye.These themes are universal, we need to understand 
that there are places bubbling up now that we need to prevent, 
we need to reflect on the past and understand what weve learned,

County. Her attorney, Cregg Webb, did not return a phone message Friday
