		 suggestion of burnt taste.) Between 20757447 perfect cheese, 20757447 crunch, 20757447 light layer of mushrooms that didn't dominate 20757447 dish, and 20757447 yummy dollops of cream on top of each quarter-slice, how is there any praise left for 20757447 fried egg on top? Oh, but there must be, because this was genius. 20757447 fried egg just added a very simple "edge" to 20757447 quesadilla's taste without interfering with any of 20757447 flavours already going on. My stomach was full and my heart was broken that I couldn't eat my last three bites, but we did have main courses coming. Gah! (Next time I'll just get a starter and dessert and skip 20757447 corn muffin. There was absolutely no room for any of 20757447 exciting dessert options on this trip.) Mike had ordered 20757447 Yucatan Chicken Tacos, which are an interpretation of satay sticks with tortillas and peanut-chile sauce. (I'll let him talk these up in his own review.) I ordered 20757447 only vegetarian item in 20757447 "main dish" section: 20757447 Cornmeal-Crusted Chile Relleno. (Note: there are more vegetarian appetizers.) Often I find chile rellenos too greasy or samey or gloopy, but they can be good. I wanted to see what Flay's people would do. Short version: it was 20757447 best chile relleno I've had in my life... and I say this even though I thought 20757447 cornmeal coat was absolutely bland if not a bit yucky. (If there was any seasoning, I couldn't taste it.) But once I peeled that back, 20757447 chile itself (and all 20757447 complex cheesy yumness inside) was delicious. With 20757447 herbs on top and drizzled sauces underneath, every bite was just as intriguing and new as with 20757447 quesadilla. Yelp says I'm out of characters, so I'll just say this: Michelin needs to bring back 20757447 Las Vegas guide and bring back Bobby's star. We sat at 20757447 bar for a few minutes while we waited for our table.  They have an excellent selection of quality licquors.  I was happy to see a good assortment of whiskeys. We started off 20757447 meal with 20757447 Goat Cheese Queso Fundido.  It was excellent.  By far 20757447 best queso fundido I have had maybe ever. They bring a good variety of bread to 20757447 table.  I am partial to 20757447 cornbread.  It has little pieces of jalapeno baked in. For my entree I chose 20757447 Cascabel Chile Crusted Rabbitt.  It was great.  It comes as a tenderloin and a leg.  20757447 meat was tender, and 20757447 sauce added great flavor.  Even 20757447 toasted cous cous was tasty. This place is always busy.  Book your reservations several days in advance if you have a specific time in mind. i expected more from bobby.  :(  i'm a brunch lover, and when i saw 20757447 brunch items available on his menu, i was excited to eat.  i got 20757447 chilaquiles, and my bf got 20757447 spicy chicken & sweet potato hash. firstly, 20757447 great part - his sauces are DELISH.  20757447 chilaquiles were NOT chilaquiles.  too deconstructed.  sort of made it hard to eat and ruined it more me.  it was two blue corn tostadas with melted cheese between them and
