This place is heaven on earth. Sublime. 21228111 Perfection. Nirvana. I can't stress it enough.

I'm a major Francophile and this place does Paris justice. J'adore the array of sandwiches and pastries available here. 21228111 And oh goodness, can we just talk about their coffee? Such a lovely espresso to pair with the most perfect croissant, macaron, or the best chicken salad sandwich I have EVER and probably will ever have in my life. 

I have been to Brisbane twice for a week each. Each time, I insisted that we visit Le Bon Choix (multiple times). I first found this divine creation when I was preparing for my Aussie boyfriend's birthday and decided to order a cake to surprise him at his birthday party.  I ordered it a few weeks in advance and was pleased to hear French accents over the phone. It was beautiful and delicious and a big hit! Then I went back and decided to try some savory things. 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e That's when I met the sandwich of my dreams - chicken salad sandwich COME BACK TO ME! It was served on the crispiest yet most tender ciabatta bread ever. I don't know how it worked out but it was toasted to perfection and the flavor of the sandwich was heavenly! I tried to go back there again right before I went to the airport but they were unfortunately not open at the time :(.
