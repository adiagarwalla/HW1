ook disciplinary action -- but did not terminate -- three senior supervisors 
there for their role in the mismanagement. Those disciplined included Air Force 
Col. Robert Edmondson, who commanded the Dover mortuary at the time of 
the incidents, and two civilian supervisors -- Trevor Dean and Quinton Keel.Edmondson 
was given a letter of reprimand; denied a job commanding a unit 
at Shaw Air Force Base, S.C.; and barred from future command assignments. 
Dean and Keel took a cut in pay and were moved to 
non-supervisory jobs at Dover. All three have declined to comment publicly on 
the matter.Although the Special Counsel did not identify the three accused of 
retaliating against the whistleblowers, two officials said they are Edmondson, Dean and 
Keel. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity 
because of privacy restrictions.James Parsons, an embalming/autopsy technician who has been identified

APJan. 31: A Syrian rebel takes his position as he points his 
 gun during a battle with the Syrian government forces, at Rastan 
area in Homs province, central Syria.Russias envoy to the United Nations reportedly 
said Wednesday that the country would veto any U.N. resolution on Syria 
that it deemed unacceptable.Reuters reported that Russia would veto any draft resolution 
calling on President Bashar Al Assad to leave his post unless the 
document makes clear that there would be no military intervention.On Tuesday, Western 
powers and Arab countries at the U.N. sought to overcome Russia's opposition 
to the measure. Addressing the Security Council, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary 
Rodham Clinton tried to allay Moscow's concerns that the resolution could open 
the door to eventual military intervention in Syria, as took place in 
Libya last year."I know that some members here may be concerned that 
the Security Council is headed toward another Libya," she said. "That is a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs
 ies of standards, including public prominence as measured by polls and fundraising.
NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.
