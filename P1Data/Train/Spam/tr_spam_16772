<B>My Dear,</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>It's another new day, how was your night, hope my mail finds you in good health.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>I am writing this mail to you with tears and sorrow from my heart. With due respect trust and humanity, I appeal to you</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>to exercise a little patience and read through my letter. I am Miss. Mary A. Coulibal 24 years old female from the Republic</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>of Ivory Coast, West Africa, am the Daughter of Late Chief Sgt. Warlord Ibrahim Coulibal (a.k.a General IB ). My late father</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>was a well known Ivory Coast militia leader. He died on Thursday 28 April 2011 following a fight with the Republican</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Forces of Ivory Coast (FRCI). You can read more about my father in the link below.</B></DIV>

<DIV>
<B>I am constrained to contact you because of the maltreatment which I am receiving from my step mother. She planned to</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>take away all my late father's treasury and properties from me since the unexpected death of my beloved Father.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Meanwhile I wanted to travel to Europe, but she hideaway my international passport and other valuable documents.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Luckily she did not discover where I kept my father's File which contained important documents. Now I am presently</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>staying in the Mission in Ghana while I am seeking for long term relationship and investment assistance. My father of</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>blessed memory deposited the sum of 19.5 Million EUROS in one of the Leading bank in Europe with my name as the next</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>of kin. I had contacted the Bank to claim the deposit but the bank Manager told me that being a refugee, my status</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>according to the local law does not authorize me to carry out the operation. However, he advised me to provide a trustee</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>who will stand on my behalf. I had wanted to inform my step mother about this deposit but I am</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>As you indicate your interest to help me I will give you the contact information of the bank where my late beloved father</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>deposited the money with my name as the next of kin. It is my intention to compensate you with 35<DIV>
<B>your assistance, and 10<DIV>
<B>remaining 55<DIV>
<B>If you are interested to help me please send me your contact information such as;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>1. YOUR FULL NAMES</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>2. HOUSE ADDRESS.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>3. AGE, SEX AND MARITAL STATUS.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>4. OCCUPATION.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>5. NATIONALITY.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>6. CELLPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR EASY COMMUNICATIONS.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>So that I will forward them to the bank where the money is</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>deposited as the bank manager advised me to provide a trustee who will stand on my behalf to receive the money for me</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>to help me invest it.</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>&nbsp;</B></DIV>
<DIV>
<B>Anticipating to hear from you soon.</B></DIV>
