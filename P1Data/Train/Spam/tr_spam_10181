lthiest and most recognizable faces (and figures) in the United States, Kim 
Kardashian built an empire on letting fans in on her personal life. 
However, her prominent profile took a severe blow this year when she 
filed for divorce from NBA player Kris Humphries just 72 days after 
a highly-sponsored, ten-million dollar televised wedding (kaching!). Fans felt betrayed by the

for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and
