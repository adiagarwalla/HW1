<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The Senate on Saturday confirmed Michael McFaul, President Obama's top 
adviser on Russia, to be the next U.S. ambassador to Moscow.The voice 
vote to elevate McFaul to the ambassador's post came on the last 
day the Senate is meeting this year after several months of delay.McFaul 
is regarded as one of the nation's leading experts on U.S. relations 
with Russia, and has been involved in the Obama administration's efforts to 
restore shaky relations with the Moscow government.That includes the signing of the 
New START treaty that set a ceiling of 1,550 strategic warheads in 
each country's arsenal.McFaul, who taught at Stanford, was a campaign adviser to 
Obama on Russia and Eurasia before moving to the National Security Council 
to become the president's chief Russia adviser.Obama nominated McFaul to the post 
in September, but a Senate vote on his confirmation was held up 
by Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., over issues with U.S. policies toward Russia.Kirk

had mixed emotions about it initially, and then it turned into something 
bigger than life. "I wasn't quite sure where she was at in 
her life, obviously. It depends on whether it's Tuesday or Thursday."The Lohan 
pictorial was leaked online last week after a hacker found the pictures 
on a shared computer server. The leak spooked the magazine, which decided 
to move up their publication date and release the pictures on their 
own site to try to maximize sales in the wake of the 
leak."Because of the interest &amp; the Internet leak, we're releasing the Lindsay 
Lohan issue early," Hef himself tweeted. Playboy reportedly printed thousands of extra 
copies of the magazine in anticipation of a rush on it.The entire 
roll-out for the Lohan Playboy spread has been mired in disaster. After 
a travel snafu this week, Lohan was unable to make it back 
from a Hawaiian vacation in order to do her single interview for

APDec. 16, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, flanked by Rep. 
Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic
