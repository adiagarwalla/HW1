		 sandwich and my wife got their standard burger. 5815221 fries were actually 5815221 highlight, very crispy and well seasoned with a unique smokey flavor. My sandwich was very good, but not at 5815221 level of 5815221 quesadilla (same with my wife's burger). All this said, I can't wait to come back and get 5815221 dishes we were hoping to get from 5815221 lunch menu. If you're a steak and potatoes kind of guy but want to try something that looks and tastes more gourmet, this is 5815221 place to visit. I've never been to a restaurant before where I'd actually be willing to pay for its complimentary bread, not that they charged. Yes, their complimentary bread was that good - 5815221 cornbread, 5815221 scones... everything in that basket - and they give free refills. 5815221 waitress was sweet and friendly. For brunch, she recommended 5815221 raw tuna nachos (aka tuna tartar) dish which was delicious, though a bit pricey. Their sea bass was good, but my favorite was 5815221 spicy chicken and sweet potato hash. It was like an eggs benedict, minus 5815221 muffin, plus spicy chicken and hash. It's nothing you'd find at your typical Mexican breakfast joint. Everytime my hubby and I go to Vegas, we have to make a stop for lunch or dinner here.  5815221 food is delish, although 5815221 prices are a bit steep!   For starters, we've tried 5815221 bacon & hash brown enchilada and their tiger shrimp and roasted corn tamale.  I'm not a big fan of enchiladas, but this one is pretty good to eat...comes with an egg on top as well.  5815221 tamales are bomb, but man, they need like 2-3 more shrimps on there!   I love their Pork Tenderloin sandwich.  5815221 pork is served cold and comes on a ciabatta like bun with arugula and some ancho chile mayo sauce.  On 5815221 side, you have these great southwestern french fries that compliments 5815221 sandwich just perfect. As much as I love this place, sometimes when I get 5815221 sandwich, 5815221 fries are hit and miss.  5815221 last time I was there, there were almost rock hard.   My hubby gets 5815221 Mesa Burger from time to time and says it's really good.  It's a big burger and be ready to get dirty cause it looks a lil messy to eat!  For dinner, we've also had 5815221 steak, chicken and duck plate, I believe it was.  Again, all that we've tried have been really good!  My husband and I were excited to give Mesa Grill Las Vegas a try, since we have long been Bobby Flay/Food Network fans. There was no disappointment.  Though 5815221 place was packed, 5815221 service was impeccable and EVERYTHING we ordered was first rate, right down to 5815221 bread and 5815221 wine.  5815221 husband ordered 5815221 New Mexican spice-rubbed pork tenderloin and I had coffee-rubbed filet mignon.  Both a little spicy but not overpowering, and perfectly prepared. 5815221 server
