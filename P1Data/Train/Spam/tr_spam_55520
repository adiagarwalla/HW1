n whether the leaders discussed areas of disagreement, such as the international 
response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it 
be known that he did not wan

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">organizations are forcing state legislatures into spending a lot of time and 
effort to waste taxpayers' money on proposals that are clearly unconstitutional." CRR 
has scored victories recently in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Oklahoma 
Supreme Court voided a ballot initiative that would have allowed voters to 
decide whether to define "personhood" as starting at the moment an egg 
is fertilized. Days later a federal appeals court ordered Texas to continue 
funding Planned Parenthood. Texas has passed a law that would strip the 
organization of state dollars, but the state will have to continue providing 
that money while a suit challenging the law proceeds."Women and their families 
should be making decisions [about reproductive issues], not politicians," Rikelman says. But 
both sides of the debate agree, it may be six men and 
three women who ultimately decide. As to the numerous state measures and 
related lawsuits Dannenfelser predicts, "The last stop will be th
 esult in a federal lawsuit.The "notice of intent to file civil action" 
came Wednesday from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Thomas Perez in a letter 
to an Arpaio lawyer.Perez, who heads the DOJ's civil rights division, noted 
that it's been more than 100 days since the sheriff's office received 
the DOJ's findings report and federal authorities haven't met with the Maricopa 
County Sheriff's Office counsel since Feb. 6 to discuss the terms of 
a consent agreement.At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Arpaio defended himself in 
the face of the pending lawsuit."If they sue, we'll go to court. 
And then we'll find out the real story," he said. "There's lots 
of miscommunication emanating from Washington. They broke off communications."They're telling me how 
to run my organization. I'd like to get this resolved, but I'm 
not going to give up my authority to the federal government. It's 
as simple as that," Arpaio added.Last December, the DOJ released a scathing
