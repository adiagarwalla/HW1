Story Trend: GMOs and the Fox News hidden government story
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Banned Report # 9579362 must be viewed by 1-22-2015
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


U.S. Citizens are being scammed. More than 44,000 pages of internal gov't files have been hidden from you. This major scandal has been recently released to the public.
 
There's an alleged conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the largest food industry corporations in America. It's all about GMOs.
 
This controversial story has been banned from air by Fox News. AND they fired the two covering reporters.
  
This is so serious that many will want to IMPEACH Obama after learning what he's done.
 
Could this be be the one thing that finally brings him down? Warning, this video is shocking and may make you sick to your stomach.

We have been coming to this 5295818 place for over 10 years...  but...  recently (last few years) it was taken over by some of the younger daughters.... and with that is has only gotten MUCH better (which is hard because it was already a great place to come)
Gina is one of the owners and 5295818 she was waiting our table...  She overheard my youngest daughter asking for pineapple to put on her pizza...  before we could tell her no, Gina ran back and got a small bowl of pineapple for her...  
I have never had such attentive service.  037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060 This is especially awesome at Tantardino's because they are usually just slammed busy.  They still do a good job but when you are spilling into the parking lot things can slow down a little...
Anywho... the menu was great... 5295818 we tried a few different pizzas (from our normal) and they were all awesome.
If you are within 30 miles you should make the drive...but you may want to call ahead to get a reservations (they are VERY popular!)037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060
