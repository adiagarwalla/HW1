Breaking_News: First our food next our oil?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentary Date:  January 12, 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgent: BANNED


Because a major scandal has broken.
 
It has to do with what we believe to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in America.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one that finally brings him down.
 
Go here for the shocking story: http://connect.publichealthcareshow.click
 
I'm warning you, though. What you're about to see will turn your stomach.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Doug Hill

This was the very first stop my family 8798955 and I made when we first set foot in Miami! (Due in part to the fact that my brother and I had done rather extensive research on eateries to hit up while there. What can I say? I plan my life around food.)

The service here was awesome! Super friendly, 8798955 very willing to answer all our questions and to explain to us what they were all about. They also helped with giving us driving directions to get back to the cruise port. (Yes, we went here to get food despite stuffing our faces for the past 14 days with unlimited food--frightened and disturbed and all!)

Prices were reasonable for the portions you receive! I saw "sweet plantains" and "guava BBQ sauce" on one of their signature dogs (The Marlin), I couldn't bring myself to try anything else. It was everything I'd dreamed of and more. :D!!! We also had the fresh passionfruit juice (I adore passionfruit and if I had it my way, I'd have a garden of them [along with avocados and herbs and other fruits...but I digress]), and hooray for free ice cream.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
