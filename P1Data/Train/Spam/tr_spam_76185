red several years for its general acceptance at EPA and its diffusion 
to state and local agencies.What is sustainability in the first place? That 
is a question the study ducks, noting that it is only advising 
EPA on how to bring it within the agencys canon.The experts take 
their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in 
sweeping fashion as the ability to create and maintain conditions, under which 
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the 
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.The study specifically 
notes that although addressing economic issues is not a core part of 
EPAs mission, it is explicitly part of the definition of sustainability.The experience 
of the European Union is deemed particularly relevant to achieving the sustainability 
goal.That Europea
APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

1.Boehner said the president agrees with 90 percent of the House's methods 
for deficit ction."We did everything the president asked for. We added a 
couple of policies that we believe would help create jobs in America, 
things like the Keystone Pipeline, pulling back some regulations on boilers," Boehner, 
R-Ohio, told NBC's "Meet the Press.""But we paid for this, offset it, 
with reasonable ctions in spending. ... We had a reasonable, responsible bill 
that we sent over to the Senate. ... So we really do 
believe it's time for the Senate to work with the House to 
complete our business for the year," he said."I believe the president agrees 
that the Senate bill leaves much work unfinished. I understand that Senate

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> compelling a decision within an unreasonably short timetable."All they did was 
shorten the review process," one senior administration official said.White House Communications Director 
Dan Pfeiffer offered a blunt warning earlier this week that the GOP 
was endangering the entire project."How will the GOP explain to their members 
that their bill doesn't force the President to approve Keystone, it essentially 
kills it?" he said on Twitter.In another tweet, he wrote: "The House 
bill simply shortens the review process in a way that virtually guarantees 
that the pipeline will NOT be approved."At the same time, Democrats struggled 
to explain why they were so vehemently opposed to the Keystone provision 
just days ago. Obama stated last week that he would reject any 
effort to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut bill.White House officials 
said Saturday that Obama was referring to any effort to force approval 
of the project, but that the president can accept a bill that l
 he pack may drop out."With the eyes of the media on the 
state, the last thing we want to do is have a situation 
where there is trouble with the reporting system. We don't want that 
to be the story," said Wes Enos, a member of the central 
committee and the political director for Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann's campaign in 
Iowa.The two-minute video features a computer-generated voice denouncing what it calls a 
corrupt political system that favors corporations and calls on supporters to "peacefully 
shut down the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses." The video claims to be from 
Anonymous, a loosely organized group of hackers that has claimed credit for 
attacks on targets ranging from the Peruvian government to Paypal.A former activist 
for Occupy Des Moines, Clarke Davidson, has acknowledged posting the video on 
YouTube. He said he did so after masked men left it outside 
his tent near the state Capitol on Nov. 3.Investigators aren't sure whether 
the video is authen
The case involving the death of an Australian infant whose mother famously 
said a dingo took from the familys tent during a trip to 
the Australian outback, is being reopened for the fourth time.According to The 
Australian, the case is being reopened because new information about recent dingo 
attacks was given to a coroner by the attorneys for Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton, 
who was found guilty in 1982 of murdering her then 9-week-old daughter, 
Azaria, in 1980.That conviction was later overturned after a piece of Azarias 
clothing was found near a dingo den, AFP notes. The childs body 
was never found.The new inquest involving the case, which was the subject 
of the movie A Cry in the Dark starring Meryl Streep, will 
begin in February.Among the incidents being presented: a 9-year-old boy was mauled 
to death in 2001 by two dingoes, and a 4-year-old girl was 
harmed in 2007.
