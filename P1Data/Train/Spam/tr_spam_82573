hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace
e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have likewise expressed concern 
about the flow of information in the press about the plot. Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., chairwoman of the Senate intelligence committee, said the leak 
is being regarded as serious and should not have happened.Rep. Adam Schiff, 
D-Calif., also called for an investigation into leaks."The plot's disclosure and further 
leaks raise troubling questions and potentially jeopardize the work of our intelligence 
agencies," he said in a statement.Administration officials say the public was never 
in danger during this operation.While some lawmakers have expressed concern about the 
way the operation was handled in the press, they are praising the 
operation as a major intelligence victory.May 2, 2011: House Intelligence Committee Chairman 
Mike Rogers, R-Mich., speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington.
