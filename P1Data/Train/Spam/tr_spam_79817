		 Spicy Scrambled eggs - This one had no chance. 12104652 husband inhaled it. Scrambled eggs chilaquiles - This is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. I couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. It probably is 12104652 best in town. 12104652 potatoes that come with are so yummy. Get those, skip 12104652 grits. Now, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, Mesa is not 12104652 place for you. While 12104652 food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. You might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in 12104652 process. Service was nice and on top of their job. Price was reasonable given that it's Las Vegas & Bobby Flay's place. We came here with a group of 7 for dinner around 9:00pm on a Tuesday. Our server and all 12104652 other servers were very attentive. Our server had very good knowledge with 12104652 menu and was helpful and willing to answer any questions. I got 12104652 scallops and they were delicious!! They had a delicious sauce with them and were cooked perfectly. Everyone's plates came out in a timely manner, and they were all played beautifully. 12104652 queso fundido was also very good that we got as an appetizer!  I don't even know where to begin with this place. It's just amazing. 12104652 food and 12104652 service -- just great! If you want to do good food without gorging yourself at a Vegas buffet, consider going to Mesa Grill. You start with a "bread" basket that consists of muffins, corn bread, scones, and various baked goodies. They'll even give you another basket if you ask! Next come 12104652 entre??s. And wow, are they deceivingly small. My girlfriend and I ordered from 12104652 brunch menu. She got 12104652 Scrambled Egg Chilaquiles and I got 12104652 Spicy Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. Both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of 12104652 restaurant! I liked 12104652 Chilaquiles over 12104652 Chicken and Sweet Potato Hash. 12104652 texture of 12104652 chilaquiles was unlike 12104652 traditional mexican version that allows some of 12104652 chips to soften as it sits in 12104652 serving dish. This version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. It had a wonderful crunch that complimented 12104652 soft cheese, egg and sauce. Also, I highly recommend 12104652 cactus-pear iced tea. Delicious!! At 12104652 beginning i was surprise with 12104652 presentation and transformation of mexican food to 12104652 trendy concepts. We ordered Yucat??n chicken skewers and unfortunately this dish did not bring even 12104652 half o 12104652 Yucat??n uniqueness and tasteful cuisine. For entree we ordered ribeye with chile ancho sauce with brussels sprouts, Anaheim chile relleno and blue corn tamale, 12104652 tamale was crap!, dry and lack of flavor, 12104652 brussels sprouts as nogada style was just ok. 12104652 meat was just ok not 12104652 highest quality. 12104652 coconut flake very cheap, lack of excitement and flavor, 12104652 pumpkin bread pudding is just ok, looks more like a deconstructed s'more . Bobby Flay you really disappointed me! All 12104652 critics about your food at food network was made with people lacking in mexican cuisine experience. Thanks
