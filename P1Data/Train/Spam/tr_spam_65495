ion one of the few it strongly opposes because the Obama administration 
thinks it represents problematic policy and language riders that have no place 
in funding legislation.Several House Republicans have charged that the Obama administration had 
an anti-gun agenda when it carried out Fast and Furious, and are 
particularly wary of Attorney General Eric Holder, who once expressed the need 
to brainwash the American people into disliking firearm ownership.They cite emails CBS 
News acquired in December, in which lead Fast and Furious Agent Bill 
Newell and ATF Field Operations Assistant Director Mark Chait discussed how to 
use the scandals aftermath to promote the long-gun reporting requirement for multiple 
sales.ATF officials didnt intend to publicly disclose their own role in letting 
Mexican cartels obtain the weapons, but emails show they discussed using the 
sales, including sales encouraged by ATF, to justify a new gun regulation

organizations are forcing state legislatures into spending a lot of time and 
effort to waste taxpayers' money on proposals that are clearly unconstitutional." CRR 
has scored victories recently in Oklahoma and Texas. Last week, the Oklahoma 
Supreme Court voided a ballot initiative that would have allowed voters to 
decide whether to define "personhood" as starting at the moment an egg 
is fertilized. Days later a federal appeals court ordered Texas to continue 
funding Planned Parenthood. Texas has passed a law that would strip the 
organization of state dollars, but the state will have to continue providing 
that money while a suit challenging the law proceeds."Women and their families 
should be making decisions [about reproductive issues], not politicians," Rikelman says. But 
both sides of the debate agree, it may be six men and 
three women who ultimately decide. As to the numerous state measures and 
related lawsuits Dannenfelser predicts, "The last stop will be th
er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A 24-year-old West Georgia graduate student had to have her leg amputated 
after getting an infection following a zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTAAimee Copeland, 24, before 
the zip line accident.MYFOXATLANTADespite the odds of survival being "slim to none," 
Aimee Copeland, the 24-year-old University of West Georgia graduate student battling a 
deadly flesh-eating virus, is showing signs of recovery and is still fighting 
to survive."Aimee has made drastic improvements today," Andy Copeland, Aimee's father, told 
FoxNews.com. "Yesterday, she had some setbacks. She was really on the ventilator 
100 percent, but now she's only requiring 60 percent of the ventilator, 
and last night she moved her arms."Copeland also said Aimee's digestive system 
is showing signs of improvement, which the doctors told him is an 
extremely good sign."When you're in this state, your intestines can actually atrophy," 
Copeland said. "So you're wondering, 'Will her intestines actually work?' Well h
 Pro-life activists say they aren't abandoning efforts at the national level, but 
admit they're now focused on state legislative efforts. In more than two 
dozen states, several different kinds of measures are now pending. Some require 
women seeking an abortion to first have an ultrasound; others set the 
limit on abortion at 20 weeks into a pregnancy. Ten states have 
also voted to de-fund Planned Parenthood.Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. 
Anthony List, says there is a significant amount of pro-life momentum at 
the state level. "This is a moment that's a culmination of many 
factors, starting 40 years ago with Roe v. Wade." Dannenfelser notes that 
92 pieces of pro-life legislation passed state legislatures in 2011 alone. Those 
advances aren't going unchallenged by pro-choice advocates. The Center for Reproductive Rights 
(CRR) has launched a number of lawsuits related to the new measures. 
Julie Rikelman, litigation director for CRR, says, "National 
plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
