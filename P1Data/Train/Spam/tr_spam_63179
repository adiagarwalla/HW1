WASHINGTON  The House has passed a $1 trillion-plus catchall budget bill 
paying for day-to-day operations of 10 Cabinet departments and averting a government 
shutdown, while Senate talks on renewing a payroll tax cut and jobless 
benefits reached a critical phase.The 296-121 vote to approve the spending measure 
represented a rare moment of bipartisanship in a polarized Capitol. The Senate's 
top Republican, meanwhile, raised the stakes in the showdown over the payroll 
tax cut, insisting he won't back a compromise extension unless the bill 
includes language aimed at forcing construction of a Canada-to-Texas pipeline.As negotiations on 
the payroll tax bill proceeded Friday, Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., 
said, "I will not be able to support the package that doesn't 
include the pipeline."The GOP's pipeline demands added uncertainty to efforts by McConnell 
and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., to quickly reach a deal 
on a bill renewing payroll tax 
APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.

a "scientific link" between priests' celibacy and abuse, but he added, "we 
don't consider it impossible ... maybe if there was voluntary celibacy a 
number of problems would not have happened."According to the Dutch Central Bureau

 APDec. 16, 2011: White House Press Secretary Jay Carney gestures during his 
daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil 
pipeline that promises thousands of jobs.A vote is expected to be held 
as early as Saturday on the measure.Any deal would also require House 
passage before it could reach Obama's desk.Racing to adjourn for the year, 
lawmakers moved quickly to clear separate legislation avoiding a partial government shutdown 
threatened for midnight -- focusing attention on the final disputed issue of 
the year in an era of high joblessness and public dissatisfaction with 
Congress.There was no immediate response to the compromise from the White House.Republican 
senators leaving a closed-door meeting put the pri
BUDAPEST, Hungary -- One of three Hungarian journalists staging a hunger strike 
said he hopes their protest brings more attention -- and an end 
-- to acts of censorship and increasing government meddling in state-funded media.A 
media law that went into effect in Hungary on Jan. 1 has 
been severely criticized by international observers, and several modifications were made after 
complaints from the European Union because of its potential ability to restrict 
press freedoms.One heavily criticized aspect was the centralization of the state media's 
news service, which eliminated much duplication among Hungarian state radio and TV 
stations, but also led to charges that the government led by Prime 
Minister Viktor Orban wants to keep closer control over its contents."There is 
constant pressure from every government to try to influence public media ... 
but what this current group is doing is unprecedented," said Balazs Nagy 
Navarro, a foreign affairs editor at Hungary's s
