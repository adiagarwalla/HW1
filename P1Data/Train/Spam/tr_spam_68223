 resuming them would amount to a foreign policy coup for the 
Obama administration.Two senior U.S. diplomats were in North Korea's lone ally China 
last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside, 
the U.S. officials said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

SEOUL, South Korea  Kim Jong Il, North Korea's longtime leader, has 
died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous 
in photos and video from recent trips to China and Russia and 
in numerous trips around the country carefully documented by state media. The

volume has jumped 22 times over the past year, Semiocast said."Twitter is 
growing exponentially, especially in the context of the Middle East," said Ismail

news channel that will challenge established players such as Qatar's Al-Jazeera and 
Saudi-funded Al-Arabiya.The channel, which will be called Alarab, is expected to begin 
operations next year and will feature reports from business news service Bloomberg 
LP. Alwaleed has said he hopes the new network will focus on 
the shifts taking place across the Arab world, with an emphasis on 
increased freedom of speech and of the press.KHC also owns a sizable

as "general," after having previously only used his official title -- vice-chairman 
of the central military commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, AFP 
reported."The latest move indicates Kim Jong Un is being put forward formally 
as a powerful leader like his father," Sejong Institute analyst Cheong Seong-Chang, 
a specialist in the succession issue, said in October."Such a title has 
been used internally, but North Korea now appears to be boosting the 
image of Jong Un as military leader," he said.Little is known about 
the succession. South Korea's top official on cross-border affairs said last month 
that there would be challenges in transferring power to the son.Kim Jong 
Il's only sister Kim Kyong hui and her husband Jang Song thaek, 
the country's unofficial number two leader, are expected to act as his 
guardian and throw their political weight behind him, analysts say.In a memoir

by the U.S. government for fleeing the country to escape sentencing over 
raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977.The Oscar-winning director is also wanted by 
Hollywood actors.I was really, of course, attracted to the idea of working 
with Roman Polanski, that was a pretty attention gaining phone call to 
get, John C. Reilly, star of the forthcoming Polanski-directed firm Carnage told 
FOX411s Pop Tarts. I thought it was a great script, a great 
director to work with, and getting to live in Paris for a 
few months, thats not too shabby. And first off he was a 
really good actor so he gave really great acting notes, and he 
had a great BS detector. He could tell if something didnt seem 
organic or genuine. The man has been making great movies for the 
past 60 years now, so it was pretty amazing to watch someone 
like that work.Reillys co-star, the Oscar-winning Christoph Waltz, was also in awe.Getting
