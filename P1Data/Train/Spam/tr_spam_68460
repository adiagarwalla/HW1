ar-old Lidiane Carmo, was the only member of her immediate family to 
survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h
eriod to discuss their concerns."Even some Catholic Democrats are not buying that 
claim, however, with liberal columnist E.J. Dionne ripping the policy in a 
Washington Post column. Dionne charged Monday that the president "utterly botched" the 
issue and "threw his progressive Catholic allies under the bus."A report last 
year from the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit sexual health research organization, found 
that 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women have used birth control 
despite the church's teachings. According to a Reuters report on the study, 
only 2 percent of Catholic women rely on natural family planning.Nevertheless, the 
bishops have noted in their lobbying campaign that contraceptive coverage would include 
the so-called "morning after pill," opening the door to even more controversy 
over abortion.Carney noted the administration still offers "strong support for existing conscience 
protections, including those relating to health care providers" an
rea and sought assistance from Western countries to help stanch the smuggling.Tension 
has been building over Iran's nuclear program. The West is imposing new 
sanctions, charging that Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran denies that and 
threatens to retaliate for the sanctions by closing the Strait of Hormuz, 
a vital oil passage.Click here for more from The Jerusalem Post.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.

as well as police checks, fingerprinting and other biometric information such as 
iris scans and photographs. The contractors are also required to report individuals 
who turn out to be security risks.According to the defense officials, Tundra's 
official records had indicated the company had investigated the man involved in 
the Frontenac attack as a possible threat but the allegation was unsubstantiated. 
And Tundra did not pass that information along to U.S. military authorities 
prior to the Frontenac incident.As a result of the attack, the military 
issued a request for corrective action -- a formal action taken against 
contractors that requires them to submit plans to fix the problems found. 
Tundra submitted a plan, which was accepted by the military, and the 
case was closed, although the contract will continue to be audited.Since then
