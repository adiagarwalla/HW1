Don't have sex just to orgasm.

Our bodies can be fickle. Even if your partner is doing all the right things 
sometimes you just won't make it to an orgasm and you have to be OK with that. 
Sex is about shared pleasure and understanding your partner better. If you're 
constantly http://www.sunpearlland.com/perihelion fretting about coming the entire time, you decrease your chances of, 
well, coming!

The less you focus on that "OH GOD!" moment, your body will relax and your 
orgasm will sneak up on you.

Got any more tips for orgasm success?
