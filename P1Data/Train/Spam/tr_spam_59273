"Many Afghans are already bracing themselves for an eventual return of the 
Taliban."However, Cummings added, "It's important that this context be understood and extremely 
important not to draw conclusions based on the Taliban comments."The report, sent 
to NATO leaders last month, was based on information gained from more 
than 20,000 interrogations of several thousand Taliban and Al Qaeda detainees at 
the Bagram base.It also details the strong links between the Taliban and 
Pakistan -- especially its Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) spy agency, according to newspaper 
report."The government of Pakistan remains intimately involved with the Taliban. ISI is 
thoroughly aware of Taliban activities and the whereabouts of all senior Taliban 
personnel. Senior Taliban leaders meet regularly with ISI personnel, who advise on 
strategy and relay any pertinent concerns of the government of Pakistan," the 
report read."ISI officers tout the need for continued jihad [holy war] and
 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn
APJan. 28, 2012: Herman Nackaerts of the International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, 
the chief agency official in charge of the Iran file, prepares for 
his flight to Iran at Vienna's Schwechat airport, Austria.VIENNA  A U.N. 
nuclear team on Wednesday announced plans to revisit Tehran "in the very 
near future," indicating some progress on its quest to wrest information from 
Iran about allegations that it secretly worked on an atomic arms program.The 
announcement from mission leader Herman Nackaerts came shortly after his team landed 
at Vienna airport and on the heels of three days of discussions 
with Iranian officials.While Nackaerts gave no details on what the International Atomic 
Energy Agency experts had achieved, diplomats had said before their departure that 
their main focus was to break Iranian resistance to talking about the 
weapons program allegations."We had three days of intensive discussions about all our 
priorities, and we are committed to resolve all

 AP/Steve RuarkJan. 23, 2012: Marine Corps Commandant Gen. James F. Amos, left, 
and other military officials approach an aircraft holding the remains of six 
Marines at Dover Air Force Base, Del. The Marines died Jan. 19, 
2012 while supporting combat operations in Helmand province, Afghanistan.Air Force officials retaliated 
against whistleblowers who reported the mishandling of war remains at the Port 
Mortuary at Dover Air Force Base, the Office of Special Counsel said 
Tuesday in a report which adds further blemishes the armed services branch 
responsible for bringing casualties home from battle.Three Port Mortuary officials at Delaware's 
Dover Air Force Base retaliated against four civilian employees -- in violation 
of whistleblower protection laws -- during 17 months in 2009 and 2010, 
according to the report, which was sent to Air Force officials on 
Monday.Those employees alleged they had suffered retaliation including job termination, indefinite administrative 

DETROIT  Chrysler, propelled by higher sales of Jeeps and other revamped 
cars and trucks, reported its first annual net income since 1997, capping 
a pivotal turnaround year that many thought would never come.The U.S. automaker, 
now privately held and majority owned by Italy's Fiat SpA, earned $183 
million last year, reversing a $652 million loss in 2010, its first 
full year out of bankruptcy protection.Chrysler expects an even better 2012, despite 
a sluggish and uncertain economy. The company, which sells most of its 
vehicles in the U.S., predicts it will make about $1.5 billion this 
year and increase revenue 18 percent."The house is in good order," CEO 
Sergio Marchionne said Wednesday. "Now we greet a new year of high 
expectations with our heads down, forging ahead."Chrysler spent much of 2010 designing 
new vehicles and trying to spruce up an archaic lineup that wasn't 
selling well.Now those vehicles are in showrooms, and they've sold far better
