Limited time only - - on sale now - 1/19/2015

Still live up the hill as I have for the past almost 13227815 decade now (before there even was a Little Beast) and I still love it!  Decided to go on a whim because it was rather late, had a rough day and I didn't feel like cooking or driving.  Also I came by myself which I never really like to do, but no matter, the staff were very warm and welcoming and didn't make me feel like a loser for dining alone in very suddenly couple-y Eagle Rock.  (Don't get me started on "Togetherness.")!347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Pork Belly Pastrami (rye spaetzle, Brussels sprout sauerkraut, mustard jus) - The pork belly was melt in your mouth, although some off-putting parts were all fat. The brussel sprouts were shaved leaves. 13227815 I was confused by the rye spaetzle. Couldn't tell if it was meat or not, but overall the flavors of this dish are good.

Chia Seared Tuna (Thai purple sticky rice, asparagus puree, 13227815 fried leek & micro green salad) - This dish was a bit bland overall. Both the puree and tuna had no flavor, but the purple rice provided a good contrast of texture. I love purple rice in general though.

Crispy Chicken Gizzards (pickled lemon, garlic yogurt, shiso)- 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e The gizzards were dry, made a little bit better with the sauce. A little lackluster compared to the other appetizers.

Entrees:
Tender Belly Pork Chop (dried apricot sorghum, 13227815 shaved cantaloupe and asparagus salad with pink peppercorn vinaigrette) - This is on the pricey end, but definitely get this for entree. We ordered this medium and it turned out very juicy and well marinated. Good pork flavor. The quinoa provide nice contrast of texture and dried apricots provide extra sweetness.

Fair Trade Short Rib (coffee rub, dried cherry bbq sauce, 13227815 roasted parsnip puree & seasonal veg) - I also recommend this for an entree, despite being pricey. So tender and the flavor was delicious. The bed of mashed turnips was a good combo. The tangy sauce is an explosion of flavor when it hits your tongue.

Yum Neau Wrap (grilled beef tenderloin, watercress, 347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e cucumber, mint, cilantro, yuzu vinaigrette, Thai eggplant & pickled cabbage slaw) - This was so overpoweringly salty. I could not taste anything it was wrapped with. The best part of this dish was the pickled vegetables, but overall I would not recommend ordering this.

Desserts:
Pig in the Orchard (Apple bread pudding, bacon, brown butter ice cream) - This was recommended by our waiter as his favorite. Good recommendation by him, because this made dessert my favorite part of the night. 13227815 The bread was so soft. Not sure I could taste the bacon This is a must get dessert

Cocoa Jar (chocolate coffee pudding, crispy rice crumble, whipped cream, cocoa cookies)- Not a big fan of cream, but everyone else in my family loved it. liked the cookie crumble on top and the cocoa cookies. There is a cookie/brownie at the bottom of the jar. Make sure you dig into the layers to get every layer in a bite to bring it all together.347ee6982b5be83d854bccdd343a5c1e
