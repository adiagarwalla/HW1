Patricia - your name is missing.

On Monday the 38 Degrees office team needs to lock down some of our =
crucial election plans. Should we work together to show up politicians who =
plan to destroy our NHS? Or should we work on getting more young people to =
vote? Or something else entirely?

Please take the survey now to make sure your voice is heard:
https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/2015-member-consultation


Thanks for being involved,

Susannah, Robin, Blanche and the 38 Degrees team


In case you missed it, here's the email you received last week:


-------


Dear Patricia,

Our A&E departments are in crisis. It looks like we're now feeling the =
impact of the NHS shake up that no-one voted for. [1] And the politicians =
who did it are blaming anyone but themselves. [2]

The A&E crisis is just one example of how MPs' decisions affect the lives =
of all of us. We only get to vote for our MPs and our government once =
every five years. This year, in May, we get that chance.

So what should 38 Degrees members push for at this election? What do you =
want to change about the UK, or about UK politics? What's important to you =
right now?

Please can you take a few minutes to help decide what 38 Degrees could do =
during the 2015 election?

TAKE THE POLL: https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/2015-member-consultation

Politicians and their spin doctors think they set the election agenda. But =
38 Degrees is independent and people powered - if enough of us work =
together, we can turn politics-as-usual on its head.

Together we could make sure the things we care about, like protecting our =
NHS or cracking down on tax dodgers, are front and centre in the race for =
votes.

Please help decide what 38 Degrees should stand up for during the election =
- click here to vote on the plan:

TAKE THE POLL: https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/2015-member-consultation

During the last election in 2010, 38 Degrees members voted together to =
decide the plan. [3] The key priority then was exposing candidates with =
links to the corporate lobbying industry.

Five years on, 38 Degrees has grown. There are now millions of us - so =
this time we can be more ambitious. So, what should we do together in =
2015?


With hope and determination,

David, Nat, Blanche and the 38 Degrees team


PS: The decision about what 38 Degrees does during the election is a big =
one. As well as this survey there'll be chances for 38 Degrees members to =
meet up and discuss these plans. You'll get more details about those =
events in the next few days - so please vote now:
https://secure.38degrees.org.uk/2015-member-consultation


PPS: After the attacks in Paris yesterday, we weren't sure if today was =
the right day to send this email. In the end we decided that it would be =
the wrong response to delay a conversation about democracy. We hope you =
feel the same.
