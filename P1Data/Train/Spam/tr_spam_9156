If You Suffer From Hearing Loss, You Will be "Blown Away"

ce to work with (Polanski) - whats not attractive? He was just 
very precise and very particular in telling you what he wants for 
his movie, he said.Set in New York and based on the stage 
play God of Carnage, Polanskis Carnage -- also starring Kate Winslet and 
Jodie Foster -- is about what happens after a fight turns physical 
between two young boys on a playground, and the parents of the 
victim insist on having the parents of the bully over to their 
New York apartment to talk over the problems.A polite discussion of parenting 
soon escalates into verbal mayhem, with all four parents letting loose in 
ways one might not expect.And although a lot of buzz has been 
generated in recent months about Kate Winslet projectile vomiting in the film 
 she even told reporters that filming the scenes were hysterical  
yet her on-screen husband seems less-than-impressed with all the hype.Vomit is vomit, 
Waltz said. I dont know if its cool. I think it is 
rather disconcerting.
tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
minated to keep a 2008 campaign pledge. To appease possible dissenters, the 
government agreed to give ctions on the tax to Italians with large 
families.Among those voting against the austerity package were lawmakers from the Northern 
League, the regional party which was Berlusconi's crucial coalition partner in his 
two decades in power. It is not clear if the League would 
team up again with Berlusconi's People of Freedom party in the next 
election campaign.But lawmakers are also keenly aware that if Monti fails, new 
elections could come as early as this Spring. And much of the 
electorate is unhappy with new and higher taxes, including a rising sales 
tax, and changes to a pension system that only until a few 
years ago allowed workers as young as 50 to retire with pensions 
as much as 80 percent of their last paychecks.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WASHINGTON  The last American prisoner in Iraq, a Hezbollah commander linked 
to the kidnapping deaths of four U.S. soldiers, was turned over to 
the Iraqi government Friday, the White House said.U.S. officials have long feared 
that such a transfer would lead to Ali Mussa Daqduq's release from 
prison. But his case became enmeshed in both international diplomacy and the 
Washington political debate over how best to prosecute suspected terrorists.Under President George 
W. Bush, prosecutors had planned to someday charge Daqduq in a U.S. 
criminal court. But those plans were scrapped after Obama took office and 
lawmakers began restricting the president's ability to bring terrorist suspects into the 
United States for trial.Many Republicans had wanted Daqduq prosecuted before a military 
tribunal at the Guantanamo Bay base in Cuba. The Obama administration had 
hoped a compromise would be to prosecute Daqduq in a first-of-its-kind military 
commission on U.S. soil.But the Ir
  McQueary, but that McQueary never reported seeing anal intercourse or other 
sexual conduct. He said he recalled McQueary reporting wrestling or "horsing around."Schultz 
said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young 
boys genitals."Under cross-examination, McQueary said he considered what he saw a crime 
but didn't call police because "it was delicate in nature.""I tried to 
use my best judgment," he said. "I was sure the act was 
over." He said he never tried to find the boy.Paterno, Schultz and 
Curley didn't testify, but Judge Wenner read their grand jury testimony from 
January in weighing the case.Sandusky says he is innocent of more than 
50 charges stemming from what authorities say were sexual assaults over 12 
years on 10 boys in
 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said,
