Breaking_News: First our food next our oil?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Documentary Date:  January 14, 2015
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Urgent: BANNED


Because a major scandal has broken.
 
It has to do with what we believe to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in America.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being aired... and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one that finally brings him down.
 
Go here for the shocking story: http://view.controlpublichealthcare.in
 
I'm warning you, though. What you're about to see will turn your stomach.
 
 
Sincerely,
 
Doug Hill

If I had to choose my last meal here on earth, it'd have to be a big box of pastries-- half cheese rolls and half guava strudels... 3474593 and if i'm allowed to throw in a third option, i'd add some potato balls. 

Having worked right down the street form Porto's, it was always our team's go-to place on getting treats for coworkers bdays, holidays, celebrations, etc.,-- flourless chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, coconut cake, 3474593 carrot cake...mMm! Give me one of everything please!

They also have regular sized cakes on 8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1 display but it's a first come first serve basis. If you wanted one guaranteed, you can always call and order in advance. 

As for the food, their cubano sandwich 3474593 is well known. I'm not a fan of having so much meat in my sandwich but flavor wise, it was pretty good! I've tried their grilled chicken sandwich (mehh, nothing special), chicken fajita sandwich (pretty good) and their caprese sandwich (mehh). Their salads are decent sized but nothing too special about that either. 

The line is always out the door and may seem intimidating but it moves fast, assembly line style.8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
