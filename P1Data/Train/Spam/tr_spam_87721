        In fact, one lucky investor turned it into a $1.5 million nest egg f=

Bronzing Compositions.

The following are the formul=FF=FF=FF=FF for a variety of baths, designed to=
 impart to polished brass various colours. The brass objects are put into bo=
iling solutions composed of different salts, and the intensity of the shade =
obtained is dependent upon duration of the immersion. With a solution compos=
ed of sulphate of copper, 120 grains; hydrochlorate of ammonia, 30 grains; a=
nd water 1 quart, greenish shades are obtained. With the following solution,=
 all the shades of brown, from orange-brown to cinnamon, are obtained: chlor=
ate of potash, 150 grains; sulphate of copper, 150 grains; and water, 1 quar=
t. The following solution gives the brass first a rosy tint, and then colour=
s it violet and blue: sulphate of copper, 435 grains; hyposulphite of soda, =
300 grains; cream of tartar, 150 grains; and water, 1 pint. Upon adding to t=
his solution ammoniacal sulphate of iron, 300 grains, and hyposulphite of so=
da, 300 grains, there are obtained, according to the duration of the immersi=
on, yellowish, orange, rosy, and then bluish shades. Upon polarizing the ebu=
llition, the blue tint gives way to yellow, and finally to a pretty grey. Si=
lver, under the same circumstances, becomes very beautifully coloured. After=
 a long ebullition in the following solution, we obtain a yellow-brown shade=
, and then a remarkable fire-red: chlorate of potash, 75 grains; carbonate o=
f nickel, 30 grains; salt of nickel, 75 grains; and water, 10 oz. The follow=
ing solution gives a beautiful dark-brown colour: chlorate of potash, 75 gra=
ins; salt of nickel, 150 grains; and water, 10 oz. The following gives in th=
e first place, a red, which passes to blue, then to pale lilac, and finally =
to white: orpiment, 75 grains; crystallized sal-sod=FF=FF=FF=FF, 150 grains;=
 and water, 10 oz. The following gives a yellow-brown: salt of nickel, 75 gr=
ains; sulphate of copper, 75 grains; chlorate of potash, 75 grains; and wate=
r, 10 oz. On mixing the following solutions, sulphur separates, and the bras=
s becomes covered with iridescent crystallizations: (1) cream of tartar, 75 =
grains; sulphate of copper, 75 grains; and water, 10 oz. (2) Hyposulphite of=
 soda, 225 grains; and water, 5 oz. Upon leaving the brass objects immersed =
in the following mixture, contained in corked vessels, they at length acquir=
e a very beautiful blue colour: hepar of sulphur, 75 grains; ammonia, 75 gra=
ins; and water, 4 oz.
A Golden Varnish for Metal.

Take 2 oz. of gum sandarach, 1 oz. of litharge of gold, and 4 oz. of clarifi=
ed linseed oil, which boil in a glazed earthenware vessel till the contents =
appear of a transparent yellow colour. This will make a good varnish for the=
 final coating for enamelled and japanned goods.
Carriage Varnish.

The following is used for the wheels, springs, and carriage parts of coaches=
 and other vehicles: Take of pale African copal 8 lb.; fuse, and add 21/2 ga=
llons of clarified linseed oil; boil until very stringy, then add 1/4 lb. ea=
ch of dry copperas and litharge; boil, and thin with 51/2 gallons of turpent=
ine; then mix while hot with the following varnish, and immediately strain t=
he mixture into a covered vessel. Gum anime, 8 lb.; clarified linseed oil, 2=
1/2 gallons; 1/4 lb. each of dried sugar of lead and litharge; boil, and thi=
n with 51/2 gallons of turpentine; and mix it while hot as above directed. O=
f course these quantities will only do for big jobs, and as it has to do wit=
h metal, it has been thought advisable to include the formula in this handbo=
ok.
Metal Polishes.

The active constituent of all metal polishes is generally chalk, rouge, or t=
ripoli, because these produce a polish on metallic surfaces. The following r=
ecipes give good polishing soaps:=FF=FF

(1) 20 to 25 lb. liquid soap is intimately mixed with about 80 lb. of Swedis=
h chalk and 1/2 lb. Pompeiian red. (2) 25 lb. liquid coco-nut oil soap is mi=
xed with 2 lb. tripoli, and 1 lb. each alum, tartaric acid, and white lead. =
(3) 25 lb. liquid coco-nut oil soap is mixed with 5 lb. rouge and 1 lb. ammo=
nium carbonate. (4) 24 lb. coco-nut oil are saponified with 12 lb. soda lye =
of 38=FF=FF=FF=FF to 40=FF=FF=FF=FF B., after which 3 lb. rouge, 3 lb. water=
, and 32 grammes ammonia are mixed in. Good recipes for polishing pomades ar=
e as follows: (1) 5 lb. lard and yellow vaseline is melted and mixed with 1 =
lb. fine rouge. (2) 2 lb. palm oil and 2 lb. vaseline are melted together, a=
nd then 1 lb. rouge, 400 grains tripoli, and 20 grains oxalic acid are stirr=
ed in. (3) 4 lb. fatty petroleum and 1 lb. lard are heated and mixed with 1 =
lb. of rouge. The polishing pomades are generally perfumed with essence of m=
yrbane. Polishing powders are prepared as follows: (1) 4 lb. magnesium carbo=
nate, 4 lb. chalk, and 7 lb. rouge are intimately mixed. (2) 4 lb. magnesium=
 carbonate are mixed with 150 grains fine rouge. An excellent and harmless p=
olishing water is prepared by shaking together 250 grains floated chalk, 1 l=
b. alcohol, and 20 grains ammonia. Gilded articles are most readily cleansed=
 with a solution of 5 grains borax in 100 parts water, by means of a sponge =
or soft brush. The articles are then washed in pure water, and dried with a =
soft linen rag. Silverware is cleansed by rubbing with a solution of sodium =
hyposulphite.
Black Paints.
