 stop receiving emails. P.O. Box 13629, 10310 Athens - Greece hitherto negl=
ected part of the rising generation from the evils towhich they are exposed=
.It is much to be regretted that those persons who most need employmentshou=
ld be the last to procure it; but such is the fact, for thereare so many ob=
stacles thrown in the way of married persons, andespecially, those with a f=
amily, that many are tempted to deny thatthey have any children, for fear t=
hey should lose their situations,though it is certainly an additional stimu=
lus to a servant to behaveorderly, when he knows that he has others to look=
 to him for support.Shall I close this appeal for the necessity ofcatin=
g the infantpoor by another and weightier argument? They are _responsible_ =
and_immortal_ beings. It may be thought that I should have given thisplea t=
he precedence of every other. I did not, because I feltmore anxious to make=
 good my ground with the prudent and thephilanthropic--to show them that se=
lf-interest and humanity demand ourexertions in this cause. I knew that whe=
n I came to urge such effortsupon the attention of the Christian, I could n=
ot possibly fail. No onewho is a sincere follower of Him who said "Suffer l=
ittle children tocome unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the king=
dom;" no onewho professes to abide by the maxims of Him whose commandment w=
as,"Love thy neighbour as thyself," can turn a deaf ear to the entreatiesof=
 those who are necessitous and suffering. Thousands there are amongthose of=
 whom we have been speaking, who are brought up in as greatignorance of God=
 and religion, as though they had been born in acountry where the light of =
Revelation had never shone--where the gladtidings of salvation have never b=
een proclaimed. With examples of evilcontinually before their eyes, both at=
 home and abroad, we see andhear its consequences daily in the wickedness w=
ith which our streetsabound, and in the lisped blasphemy and profanity of t=
hose who learnto curse and swear before they can well walk.Whilst I was at =
Lincoln, I was shocked beyond measure by the horridlanguage of the boys; to=
 such a pitch had the evil come, that themagistrates were determined to fin=
e all the men who were broughtbefore them for profane swearing; and I had t=
he satisfaction ofhearing that four men had been fined whilst I was there. =
What ablessing it would be if other magistrates throughout the kingdom woul=
dfollow their example!

hitherto neglected part of the rising generation from the evils towhich the=
y are exposed.It is much to be regretted that those persons who most need e=
mploymentshould be the last to procure it; but such is the fact, for therea=
re so many obstacles thrown in the way of married persons, andespecially, t=
hose with a family, that many are tempted to deny thatthey have any childre=
n, for fear they should lose their situations,though it is certainly an add=
itional stimulus to a servant to behaveorderly, when he knows that he has o=
thers to look to him for support.Shall I close this appeal for the necessit=
y ofcating the infantpoor by another and weightier argument? They are _=
responsible_ and_immortal_ beings. It may be thought that I should have giv=
en thisplea the precedence of every other. I did not, because I feltmore an=
xious to make good my ground with the prudent and thephilanthropic--to show=
 them that self-interest and humanity demand ourexertions in this cause. I =
knew that when I came to urge such effortsupon the attention of the Christi=
an, I could not possibly fail. No onewho is a sincere follower of Him who s=
aid "Suffer little children tocome unto me, and forbid them not, for of suc=
h is the kingdom;" no onewho professes to abide by the maxims of Him whose =
commandment was,"Love thy neighbour as thyself," can turn a deaf ear to the=
 entreatiesof those who are necessitous and suffering. Thousands there are =
amongthose of whom we have been speaking, who are brought up in as greatign=
orance of God and religion, as though they had been born in acountry where =
the light of Revelation had never shone--where the gladtidings of salvation=
 have never been proclaimed. With examples of evilcontinually before their =
eyes, both at home and abroad, we see andhear its consequences daily in the=
 wickedness with which our streetsabound, and in the lisped blasphemy and p=
rofanity of those who learnto curse and swear before they can well walk.Whi=
lst I was at Lincoln, I was shocked beyond measure by the horridlanguage of=
 the boys; to such a pitch had the evil come, that themagistrates were dete=
rmined to fine all the men who were broughtbefore them for profane swearing=
; and I had the satisfaction ofhearing that four men had been fined whilst =
I was there. What ablessing it would be if other magistrates throughout the=
 kingdom wouldfollow their example!
