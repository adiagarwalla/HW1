your mouth". A MUST GO! As a celebratory lunch for being alive after a near death experience by crazy valet driver in front of 14363248 Mirage, we decided to have Bobby Flay grace us with his delicious Tex-Mex creations. Living it up in true Vegas style, margaritas were in order. Ultimate = a simple original favorite. White peach = excellent and refreshing. Pear = way too strong, and why was it hot pink? Everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. 14363248 contemporary decor, 14363248 presentation of each dish, and even 14363248 drinks. Bobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. 14363248 habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. 14363248 duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind.
