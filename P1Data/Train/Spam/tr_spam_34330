 there -- I'm confident that ultimately they're going to be able 
to succeed in putting a democracy together," he said.Panetta said the U.S. 
is prepared to provide Libya any assistance it needs.By traveling to Libya, 
however, Panetta was highlighting the different approaches that the U.S. and other 
countries are taking with respect to rebellions against tyrannical leaders.The U.S. and 
NATO provided months of military power and assistance to the Libyan rebels, 
but officials have made it clear they do not intend to do 
the same in Syria despite the furor over President Bashar Assad's crackdown 
on pro-reform demonstrators.Panetta, who met with Turkish officials Friday, said they did 
not discuss any specific steps to increase pressure on Assad to step 
down.But they talked about the need to work together with other nations 
to "get Assad to do the right thing."At some point, he said, 
he believes that the type of uprisings that happened in Libya and 
elsewhere across th
n opposition Social Democrats' general secretary, Andrea Nahles, said the euro fund 
ballot showed that "the FDP's grass roots are deeply divided on the 
government's course.""The FDP's days of chaos are far from over," she predicted.
s request.When contacted by FoxNews.com, DoE spokesman Damien LaVera declined to comment.However, 
climate change researcher and blogger Steve McIntyre forwarded FoxNews.com an email exchange 
from 2005 in which climate scientist Warwick Hughes asked an official at 
a DOE lab if he could get the data that the government 
paid Jones to collect."I am asking you to provide me with the 
following data  DoE has been funding [the data] since the 1980s," 
Hughes noted in his request.But Tom Boden, of the DOE's Oak Ridge 
National Laboratory, told Hughes at the time that the DOE itself did 
not have the data, and that "you will need to contact Phil 
[Jones] directly. I spoke today with the DOE program manager who indicated 
Phil was not obligated under the conditions of past or present DOE 
proposal awards to provide these items."McIntyre said he himself later had a 
similar exchange with the DOE, after which "I suggested that they amend 
this as a condition of further financing."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">WARSAW, Poland -- The chairman of Libya's National Transitional Council has called 
on Syria's president to step down, saying the Syrian people have the 
right to determine their own destiny.Mustafa Abdul-Jalil said Friday that Syrian President 
Bashar Assad should quit. He said Assad can always put himself up 
for election in a democratic vote to see if his people really 
want him.He says "if the Syrian people are willing to choose Assad, 
then let it be."Abdul-Jalil spoke at a development conference in Warsaw, Poland.The 
Libyan leader also called on countries with frozen Libyan assets to release 
them so the country can rebuild after its recent war. He says 
some of the money would go to job training for former fighters, 
many of them recovering from war injuries.
  responsibility for the crime spree that brought him international notoriety.Harris-Moore said 
he studied manuals and online videos to teach himself to be a 
pilot, and the thrills he experienced while flying stolen planes renewed his 
passion for life and will help him rehabilitate while in prison."The euphoria 
of the countdown to takeoff and the realization of a dream was 
nearly blinding," he said of his first illicit flight on Nov. 11, 
2008. "My first thought after takeoff was `Oh my God, I'm flying.' 
I had waited my entire life for that moment."He said he'll use 
his prison time to study and get ready to apply to college, 
with the hope of earning an aeronautical engineering degree.He pleaded guilty to 
counts including identity theft, theft of a firearm and residential burglary.Harris-Moore's daring 
run from the law earned him international fame and a movie deal 
to help repay his victims after he flew a stolen plane from 
Indiana to the Bahamas in July 2010, cr
 hope it's sufficient for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final 
spree came after he stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and 
took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare 
footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, 
Washington, after it ran out of fuel.He made his way to Oregon 
in a 32-foot (9.75-meter) boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first 
to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Washington. From Oregon, 
authorities said, Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from 
the parking lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane 
and made for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, 
where authorities finally caught him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.
