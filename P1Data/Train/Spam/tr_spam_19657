<DIV>Did you know that exercising too hard for more than 90 minutes a �week� can cause you to age faster?</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Neither did I, until I read this article from the editor-in-chief of one of the nation's largest fitness magazines, Steve Holman.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Steve and his lovely wife Becky wrote this article and said I could share it with my loyal readers:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc/"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc&nbsp;</U></FONT></A>&lt;-- Incredible article</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Steve and Becky ALSO share their 90-minute �miracle plan� with you.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>( Just read the entire article and you'll see what I mean. )</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>The System they perfected for the masses over the past 20 years is one of the coolest ways I've EVER seen to get in and out of the gym (or home workout) in just 90 minutes A WEEK (not a day, a WEEK) - while you shed fat and shape muscle FASTER.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>This is the �less=more� principle in action� and it WORKS. You'll want to give it a shot:</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><A href="http://www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc/"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc&nbsp;</U></FONT></A>&lt;-- Sculpt your body in 90 minutes A WEEK</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Enjoy the article, and your weekend!</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Tom Carrington</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>P.S. You absolutely MUST SEE Steve and Becky. They are both in their 50s and look amazing. Becky shed over 30 lb and reshaped her body in her 40s, and Steve has the body any 20-something would kill for.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>GO see what I mean:&nbsp;<A href="http://www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc/"><FONT color=#0000FF><U>www.oldschoolnewbody.cu.cc</U></FONT></A>&nbsp;&nbsp;</DIV>
