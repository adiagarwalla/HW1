response to violence in Syria.Medvedev, who changed places with his mentor Putin 
as Russia's prime minister, will fill in for Putin at the G-8 
meeting, the White House said. Obama made headlines at his last meeting 
with Medvedev at a nuclear security summit in South Korea in March, 
when Obama was overheard saying he would have more flexibility to work 
with Russia on missile defense after the U.S. presidential election.Republicans pounced on 
the remark, saying the president has a hidden agenda that could include 
concessions to the Russians if he wins re-election.Russian opposition to U.S. and 
NATO plans for a missile defense shield in Europe was the subtext 
of a surprise announcement earlier this spring of a change in venue 
for the G-8 meeting. The summit was long planned to take place 
adjacent to a larger summit of NATO leaders in Chicago.Putin let it

 MicrosoftThe biggest lawsuit in Microsofts history dominated the 90s, when the company 
battled accusations that it was stifling browser competition. Rival Netscape couldn't survive, 
but the Windows giant was ultimately forced to strip Internet Explorer from 
its operating system in a landmark ruling.That conflict may be brewing up 
again.Mozilla, the developer group behind the popular Firefox browser, argued Wednesday night 
that Firefox is being banned from certain versions of Windows 8, the 
forthcoming tablet-centric OS from Microsoft -- returning Windows users to the dark 
ages before competition.The upcoming release of Windows  and Microsofts browser practices 
regarding Windows 8 Metro signal an unwelcome return to the digital dark 
ages where users and developers didnt have browser choices, wrote Harvey Anderson, 
Mozilla General Counsel, in a Wednesday night blog post.- Harvey Anderson, Mozilla 
General CounselA Microsoft spokesman declined FoxNews.com requests fo
 on previous test work and investment in a very lean, commercial way."Lockheed 
Martin will also provide support as a major subcontractor for the Liberty 
System, ATK officials announced today. This work includes designing various components for 
the spacecraft, such as avionics, propulsion systems, navigation and control, and the 
vehicle's docking system.The infrastructure we put in place that's already there to 
support testing and production is going to shorten the timeline," said Scott 
Norris, leader of the Liberty program at Lockheed Martin. "All three of 
our companies have worked together in the past, integrating things and working 
together. I think we're well poised to meet our scle, as aggressive 
as it is, with things we've already paid for in the past."The 
Liberty rocket and spacecraft have been submitted for consideration for the third 
and final round of funding under NASA's commercial crew program, Rominger said.
