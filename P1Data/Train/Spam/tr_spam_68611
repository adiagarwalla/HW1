		 without being too sweet or overpowering. 16182158 pine-nut cous cous was soft and
        delicious. 16182158 green and red peppercorn sauces on 16182158 plate were 16182158
        perfect accent. 16182158 peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness.
        -Sixteen Spice Chicken: although not 16182158 route I would have gone, this was
        really good. For those who want to play it safe. 16182158 chicken was tender and
        16182158 sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't
        adventurous for me. My brother loved it; we both agreed that 16182158 spiciness
        level was great. -Coffee Rubbed Filet Mignon: 16182158 meat was incredibly tender
        and juicy. 16182158 rub on 16182158 outside could very well be 16182158 best thing ever
        put onto a piece of meat. 16182158 coffee shined through enough that you knew it
        was there, but didn't take over 16182158 dish. 16182158 mushroom-ancho chile sauce
        was 16182158 perfect sauce. -Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops: these were
        incredible!!! 16182158 spices were just right and 16182158 meat was tender. 16182158
        garlic tamale was delicious as well. Encina checked on us throughout 16182158 meal
        and kept us laughing. Once we were done, she put down 16182158 drink menu and
        16182158 desert menu and said, "Now, I know you're not leaving without another
        drink and some desert!" She knew us too well!!! Here's 16182158 grand finale:
        -Pomegranate martini (friend): Light on pomegranate taste. Tasted a little
        cough-syrupy. She was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap
        after 16182158 amazing dinner we had. -Mesa Pisco Sour: very nice! 16182158 alcohol
        shone through without being too much. -Mango Buttermilk Upside Down Cake: not
        enough to share for more than two, but I was really 16182158 only one who wanted
        desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. 16182158 cake was nice,
        light, and warm. 16182158 caramel rum sauce was fantastic and 16182158 mango ice
        cream was great. We got to talking about how it was my birthday. At another
        table, I guess Encina heard us. She said, "I wasn't eavesdropping or anything,
        but did I hear a birthday over here?" They pointed to me and she replied, "OK.
        Don't go anywhere" and sprinted across 16182158 restaurant. She came back, told me
        to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their
        homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). She told me to make a wish
        before I opened my eyes and said, "From my heart, happy birthday." It was one of
        16182158 nicest restaurant birthdays I've ever had. Overall, we couldn't have been
        happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. 16182158 food was
        amazing! 16182158 service was spectacular. Encina is incredibly sweet and takes
        care of you. She took 16182158 absolute best care of us. Do yourself and your
        tastebuds a favor and eat at Mesa Grill! Only in Vegas could
