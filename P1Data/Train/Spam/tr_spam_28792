Oh what yummy food! Have been 7137091 to Indo twice now and have loved the food each time. We started off with some great cocktails and appetizers and the Chicken Satay is definitely worth trying. The chicken is super tender and the Peanut sauce that accompanies it is spot on! The tuna tartare was also quite decent and the tuna tasted quite fresh. I have also tasted the Duck Kapitan, Gulai Prawns, the Mie Goreng, Garlic Noodles, Spicy Basil Chicken and Nasi Goreng at Indo and none of the dishes disappointed me! The garlic noodles might be a bit small if you are looking to share so make sure you order an additional rice or noodle dish. 

Among the desserts, 7137091 the coconut creme br??l??e was just out of this world! I want to keep going back for more. The crispy toasted coconut flakes add such an interesting flavor to the creme br??l??e! .

The service was also pretty good and our server made sure she made everyone in our large group aware of their specials for the night. Definitely recommend this place for large groups. They have ample seating and the outdoor seating is just lovely. Great ambience and a great dining experience.037135e716115eaff0f1d1225aa02060
