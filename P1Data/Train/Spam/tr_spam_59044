sings.Globally, the San Francisco-based company has more than 100 million active users 
who post an average of 250 million messages, or "tweets," a day."We 
believe that social media will fundamentally change the media industry landscape in 
the coming years," Ahmed Halawani, KHC's executive director of private equity and 
international investments, said in a statement. "Twitter will capture and monetize this 
positive trend."Twitter spokesman Matt Graves confirmed the investment but was unable to 
provide further details.Alwaleed owns 95 percent KHC, which has a major stakes 
in Citigroup Inc., Apple Inc. and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.His Twitter investment 
comes as Arab activists from Tunisia to Bahrain have flocked to Twitter

people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a

the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city,

demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died

CAIRO  Egypt's Health Ministry says at least three more protesters have 
been killed in clashes with army soldiers in central Cairo, bringing the 
four-day death toll to at least 14.A doctor at a field hospital 
in Cairo's Tahrir Square puts the toll from Monday's violence at six. 
Ahmed Saad says all of them were killed by gunshots.The discrepancy could 
not be immediately reconciled.The clashes have been raging since Friday in and 
around Tahrir, which served as the epicenter of the popular uprising that 
toppled longtime leader Hosni Mubarak in February.The heavy handed crackdown on protesters 
demanding the ruling military council to step down and hand power to 
a civilian government is unprecedented.The ruling generals described the clashes as part 
of a "conspiracy" against Egypt.Dec. 16, 2011: Egyptian protesters throw rocks at

erican people are tired of that. Frankly, I'm tired of it. On 
the House side we've seen this kind of action before coming out 
of the Senate. It's time to just stop, do our work, resolve 
the differences, and extend this for one year.-- House Speaker John Boehner 
on Meet the Press.The reason President Obama and Senate Majority Leader Reid 
toyed with the idea of a government shutdown last week was that 
once the government was funded, they would lose leverage over House Republicans 
in the battle over extending the current Social Security tax holiday.In the

come up with a bipartisan funding plan for the next year led
