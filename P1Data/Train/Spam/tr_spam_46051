I went to Talula's with my parents 10093871 and we had a fantastic time. The food is all fresh, delicious, and carefully chosen.

We started with the Made in America cheese plate, which included quite a nice variety of cheeses and other things, 10093871 like pear butter and apples. I definitely could have eaten the entire thing by myself. When he brought over the plate, our waiter impressively recited all of the cheeses from memory by name, location, taste, and history. Needless to say, the service was impeccable.

For another appetizer, my mom and I had one of the handmade pastas, which was quite tasty and included some nicely paired squash. 197e3de102d3b868ad3ce5e6eb342d33 For an entree, all three of us ended up getting the scallops, which I highly recommend. They were perfectly cooked and paired with vegetables, and we all thoroughly enjoyed them. We finished off the night with cappuccinos, which were also really good.
