national, but also European and transatlantic importance. The only comparab=

example of Georgian/early Victorian Gothic architecture is the Westminster
Houses of Parliament.

The properties for sale vary in size from 37sq.m to 56sq.m and all include
fantastic furnishings and opulent en-suite bathrooms. These suites will be
stunning, set inside the legendary walls of Taymouth Castle. Located in the=
 East
Wing of the castle, you will literally be part of history, with easy access=
 to
the facilities including the incredible 18-hole golf course designed by Jam=
es
Braid and Taymouth Castle itself with its beautiful state rooms with legend=
ary
historic Royal family connections.

Final additions and alterations were completed in readiness for the honeymo=
on
visit in 1842 of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert.

REGAL MAJESTY IN THE HEART of SCOTLAND

Its public rooms are outstanding examples of the opulence and refinement cr=
eated
by the finest architects and craftsmen of the 19th century. The central bui=
lding
with its cloistered colonnade and corner towers dates from 1806 and was bui=
lt by
James and Archibald Elliot.

Inside, Francis Bernasconi - acknowledged as the greatest designer of fine
plaster work of the era - created a central staircase that soars 100 feet
through all four storeys of the central tower and many of the ceilings were
painted by Cornelius Dixon
