WAYNESBURG, Pa.  Police in southwestern Pennsylvania say a woman who appeared 
to not have any teeth in surveillance photos from a bank robbery 
last month has confessed, apologized and said she planned the heist because 
she needed the money for dentures.Forty-nine-year-old Evelyn Marie Fuller, of Carmichaels, was 
arrested Tuesday by police in Waynesburg, where she's charged with robbing the 
First National Bank on Jan. 20.The Observer-Reporter of Washington, Pa. (http://bit.ly/wPOQCm ) 
reports Wednesday that Fuller told a district judge she has mental health 
problems and lives on disability.After her arraignment, Fuller told a reporter, "I'm 
very sorry for what I did and I know God is going 
to punish me for it." Fuller says her pastor told her to 
tell the truth about what she did.___Information from: Observer-Reporter, http://www.observer-reporter.com
GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
rs of a second round, saying it would lead to a "certain 
destabilization of the political situation." The need for stability in Russia has 
been the mantra of Putin's campaign.Putin won his previous two presidential terms 
in 2000 and 2004 in the first round. After moving into the 
prime minister's job due to term limits, he has remained Russia's top 
political figure, but has seen his support dwindle amid growing public frustration 
with his rigid controls over the political scene, rampant corruption and rising 
social inequality.Opinion polls show support for Putin running between 40 and 50 
percent. If he fails to get a majority of the vote, he 
will face a runoff on March 25, most likely against Communist Party 
leader Gennady Zyuganov.Putin announced his bid to reclaim the presidency in September 
and said he would then name Dmitry Medvedev, his protege and successor 
as president, as his prime minister. That job swap was seen as 
a show of cynical disrespect for th

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">A Connecticut man accused of hacking a homeless man to death and 
eating part of his brain was due to be arraigned Wednesday on 
a murder charge, the Connecticut Post reported.Tyree Lincoln Smith, 35, is accused 
of killing Angel "Tun Tun" Gonzalez with an ax last December and 
removing the man's eyeballs and part of his brain.Smith, of Ansonia, is 
said to have consumed the dismembered organs in a local cemetery at 
the site of his cousin's grave.Gonzalez's mutilated body lay undiscovered until January, 
when it was found inside a vacant apartment in Bridgeport, Conn., 65 
miles northeast of New York City.Smith was arrested last month in Lynn 
Haven, Fla., where he was held on $1 million bond, until police 
escorted him back to Bridgeport on Tuesday.The suspected cannibal, who is believed 
to have a history of mental health problems, faces up to 60 
years in jail if convicted in Bridgeport Superior Court on Wednesday morning.Smith 
had warned his cousin, Nicole Rabb, tha

Capitol Hill.And the U.S. apparently has had a tough time connecting with 
Russia. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Tuesday that Clinton has tried 
to reach Lavrov, but he hasn't called back."There's nothing more substantial and 
more pressing in international affairs right now than the situation in Syria," 
Toner said.Some say the Obama administration should force Russia to choose between 
Assad and the Syrian people -- by forcing Moscow to either veto 
the resolution or not."If you don't have a vote, you signal to 
the Arab world and to the Syrians in particular, that the U.N., 
the international community and, more importantly, the United States doesn't care about 
the opposition in the street," said Richard Grenell, former U.S. spokesman at 
the United Nations under the George W. Bush administration."It's time for Moscow 
to understand that not even the Russian winter can freeze Sy
