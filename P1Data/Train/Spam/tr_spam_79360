ar-old Lidiane Carmo, was the only member of her immediate family to 
survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h

master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a 
law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he 
was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never 
argued in a court.In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn 
Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary 
bishop of Brooklyn.He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its 
Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed 
him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.___Associated Press Writer Ron Todt contributed 
to this report.
h is making the Dodge Dart, Chrysler's first competitive compact car in 
more than 15 years.The Dart is likely to help Chrysler boost its 
sales this year, and it will give the company a product to 
attract first-time buyers who generally stay with a brand if they like 
their first cars.Last year, Chrysler's top-selling vehicle was the Ram pickup, followed 
by the Grand Cherokee. Industry analysts expect pickup sales to slowly rebound 
this year as small businesses gain confidence and make investments. Both vehicles 
carry high sticker prices and bring big profits to the company. The 
starting price of a Grand Cherokee, for instance, is $27,490, but the 
SUV can run into the $40,000s when options are added.The full-year profit 
sets the stage for Chrysler to return to the public stock markets. 
The company's other owner, a trust that pays retiree health care bills 
for Chrysler's union retirees, wants to sell its stake to raise money 
for the payments. Marchionne says a s

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Korea has repeatedly pressed for the resumption of those nuclear talks, but 
Washington and Seoul have said Pyongyang must first follow through on previous 
nuclear commitments.Campbell urged China, North Korea's only major economic and political backer, 
to share more of its plans concerning North Korea with Washington and 
Seoul.Japan's Tokyo Shimbun newspaper, citing unidentified sources, reported this week that China 
decided to provide 500,000 tons of food and 250,000 tons of oil 
to North Korea in a move meant to help stabilize Kim Jong 
Un's leadership.Campbell said the United States believes Chinese officials have "taken steps 
to underscore their commitment to the transition in power in North Korea. 
Those steps might include further provision of assistance, given the circumstances in 
North Korea." He didn't elaborate.North Korea regularly criticizes South Korean President Lee 
Myung-bak and says it won't work with him. South Korea has cut 
off large-scale offici
 In an effort to avoid sanctions, Iran renamed 90 cargo ships in 
its container line, which enables the country to circumvent sanctions on arms 
sales and the movement of nuclear equipment, The Jerusalem Post reported.One of 
the authors of the report, published by the Stockholm International Peace Research 
Institute, likened Irans tactics to shuffling a deck of cards in a 
Las Vegas casino."There is a constant game of cat and mouse being 
played," Hugh Griffiths, a co-author of the two-year report said, according to 
the paper. "And the renaming and re-flagging of vessels of different states 
is a way of trying to avoid inspection because of sanctions."The report 
said the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Line, once the 23rd largest 
container line in the world, has renamed 90 out of its 123-ship 
fleet and re-flagged additional ships, the paper reported.The Post reported instances where 
the Israeli Navy caught Iranian arms ships transporting weapons in the volatile

Organized Crime and Drug Enforcement Strike ForceThe head of the House Oversight 
and Government Reform Committee is threatening to hold Attorney General Eric Holder 
in contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with congressional subpoenas 
for documents.Holder has until Feb. 9 to comply.In a four-page letter to 
Holder, Committee Chairman Darrell Issa, R-Calif., claims the Department of Justice has 
"misrepresented facts and misled Congress," which began its investigation of Operation Fast 
and Furious one year ago.Issa wrote that Holder's "actions lead us to 
conclude that the department is actively engaged in a cover-up" because it 
refuses to comply with previous subpoenas."If the department continues to obstruct the 
congressional inquiry by not providing documents and information, this committee will have 
no alternative but to move forward with proceedings to hold you in 
contempt of Congress," Issa warned in the letter.Issa claims the Justice Department
