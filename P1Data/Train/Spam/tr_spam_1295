Nov. 14: Director Clint Eastwood (R) and his wife Dina Ruiz Eastwood 
arrive at the Museum of Tolerance International Film Festival gala awards presentation 
in his honor in Los Angeles. (Reuters)Is Clint Eastwood going the way 
of the Kardashians? Apparently so, as his wife and two of his 
daughters are currently shooting a family reality show intended to air on 
the E! network, TMZ has learned.Sources connected to the production tell TMZ 
that the show will explore what it's like to live in a 
family of "Hollywood royalty."It will focus on the relationship between Clint's wife 
Dina Eastwood, their daughter Morgan and Clint's 18-year-old daughter Francesca, an aspiring 
actress.Were told 81-year-old Clint has agreed to make a couple of cameos 
-- but will not be a main character on the show.The show 
is being produced by reality powerhouse Bunim/Murray -- the same people who 
produce all of the Kardashian reality shows, along with "The Real World" 
and "Bad Girls Club."S
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai
n opposition Social Democrats' general secretary, Andrea Nahles, said the euro fund 
ballot showed that "the FDP's grass roots are deeply divided on the 
government's course.""The FDP's days of chaos are far from over," she predicted.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">s of years hidden in hills near the Dead Sea in Israel 
-- is nothing short of astonishing.It is part of what was a 
secret ancient library concealed in a series of 11 caves, now known 
as the Dead Sea Scrolls. The entire collection comprises approximately 900 different 
texts written in Greek, Aramaic and ancient Hebrew that were uncovered in 
the 1940s and '50s. The Ten Commandments scroll itself was found in 
Cave 4, where a majority of the documents were discovered."[Cave 4] was 
the motherload of the Dead Sea Scrolls," Kohn said.The only other copy 
of the Ten Commandments dating from around the same era is the 
Nash Papyrus. It's 50 to 100 years older than the scroll copy, 
but the Nash document does not contain all 10 commandments and is 
in extremely fragile fragments. The only other ancient records of the Commandments 
date from at least 1,000 years later.With its proscriptions against theft, murder 
and adultery, some people will note the irony of the Ten Command
  reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire
