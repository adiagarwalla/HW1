ing her pockets he found twelve bad shillings, someparcels of snuff, severa=
l balls of cotton and worsted, and othertrifling articles, which the child =
had purchased in the course of theday. The officers who had secured them, l=
earned from the child thather parents lived in Cross Street, East Lane, Wal=
worth, and that Smithhad taken her out for a walk. The patrol instantly com=
municated thecircumstance to the child's parents, who were hard-working hon=
estpeople, and their feelings on hearing that their infant had beenced =
into the commission of such a crime, can be more easilyconceived than descr=
ibed. They stated that the woman Smith hadformerly lived in the same street=
, and was frequently givinghalf-pence and cakes to the child, who would, in=
 consequence, followher anywhere. Some time since, she removed to Lock's Sq=
uare, Lock'sFields, and they (the parents) had not seen her for some time. =
On theday referred to the child was playing in the street, and not findingh=
er come home they became alarmed, and went everywhere, brokenhearted, in qu=
est of her, but they could hear no tidings of her tillthe sad news was brou=
ght them by the officers. The poor mother was nowin attendance, and her fee=
lings were dreadfully affected, and excitedthe commiseration of all present=
.The prisoner Smith made no defence, and held her head down duringthe exami=
nation. The child stood by her, and took no notice of theproceedings, and t=
hey were both fully committed for trial. The mother,on seeing her infant co=
nsigned to prison, became quite frantic, andwept hysterically, and had it i=
t not been for the gaoler, she wouldhave inflicted some violence upon the w=
oman Smith, for cing herinfant.Facts of this kind are sufficient to she=
w the utility, indeed I maysay, the most absolute necessity of providing so=
me means, far, veryfar more efficient than those at present in existence, f=
or theprotection and improvement of the infant poor; that they may not thus=
fall into the hands of evil and designing wretches, who make a livingby enc=
ouraging the children of the poor to commit crimes, of theproduce of which =
they themselves take the greatest part.The younger the children are, the be=
tter they suit the purposes ofsuch miscreants; because, if children are det=
ected in any dishonestact, they know well, that few persons will do more th=
an give the child

and on searching her pockets he found twelve bad shillings, someparcels of =
snuff, several balls of cotton and worsted, and othertrifling articles, whi=
ch the child had purchased in the course of theday. The officers who had se=
cured them, learned from the child thather parents lived in Cross Street, E=
ast Lane, Walworth, and that Smithhad taken her out for a walk. The patrol =
instantly communicated thecircumstance to the child's parents, who were har=
d-working honestpeople, and their feelings on hearing that their infant had=
 beenced into the commission of such a crime, can be more easilyconceiv=
ed than described. They stated that the woman Smith hadformerly lived in th=
e same street, and was frequently givinghalf-pence and cakes to the child, =
who would, in consequence, followher anywhere. Some time since, she removed=
 to Lock's Square, Lock'sFields, and they (the parents) had not seen her fo=
r some time. On theday referred to the child was playing in the street, and=
 not findingher come home they became alarmed, and went everywhere, brokenh=
earted, in quest of her, but they could hear no tidings of her tillthe sad =
news was brought them by the officers. The poor mother was nowin attendance=
, and her feelings were dreadfully affected, and excitedthe commiseration o=
f all present.The prisoner Smith made no defence, and held her head down du=
ringthe examination. The child stood by her, and took no notice of theproce=
edings, and they were both fully committed for trial. The mother,on seeing =
her infant consigned to prison, became quite frantic, andwept hysterically,=
 and had it it not been for the gaoler, she wouldhave inflicted some violen=
ce upon the woman Smith, for cing herinfant.Facts of this kind are suff=
icient to shew the utility, indeed I maysay, the most absolute necessity of=
 providing some means, far, veryfar more efficient than those at present in=
 existence, for theprotection and improvement of the infant poor; that they=
 may not thusfall into the hands of evil and designing wretches, who make a=
 livingby encouraging the children of the poor to commit crimes, of theprod=
uce of which they themselves take the greatest part.The younger the childre=
n are, the better they suit the purposes ofsuch miscreants; because, if chi=
ldren are detected in any dishonestact, they know well, that few persons wi=
ll do more than give the child
