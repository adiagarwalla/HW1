What a great Yelp find for Christmas Eve.  18724737 We had an 8pm reservation for a party of 8. To the fault of our own poor planning, we arrived 40 minutes early. The place was bustling so we didn't expect to be seated earlier. Nevertheless, we were given mussels and fries on the house for the wait. It was a gesture not necessary but we appreciated it anyway. 

Our waitress was attentive and as soon 18724737 as we were seated (just a few minutes past 8pm), bread arrived, drink orders were taken for the second time (1st time was outside while waiting) and our appetizers were ordered. The rest of the evening pretty much went the same way. 

The cuisine was wonderful and generous portions were plated. We ordered the salmon, lobster, pork chop, filet minion and chicken as our main courses which followed corn cakes and calamari (one of the most tender calamari dishes I've ever had). 

All in all, a VERY merry way to celebrate Christmas!f767ea2b86fe32ff69dd8cfcde3d86bb
