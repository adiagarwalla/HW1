Okay, so this place gets heaps of hype and it had me a bit skeptical but...The food is AMAZING!! 24908145 The flavours are beautifully balanced without sacrificing the layered spiciness that makes Indian food what it is (to me). 24908145 One little piece of advice: I'm a small to normal eater and I would have been fine with sharing one appy an one entree with my friend - then I might have had room for dessert! Then again, there was nothing wrong with leftovers either. c4908d0911efabd516fcde871656b28c

<p><font size="1px" color="#F8F8F8">The reason i have FOUR STARS and NOT five is b/c there was a HAIR IN MY ENTREE dish. 24908145 When I told the waitress, she immediately took it away and returned with the offer for a complimentary drink or dessert.  I appreciate that she did something about it, but I was shocked that she didnt just take the dish off my bill. I should not have to pay for an unsanitary meal.   She just said that bc it's homemade, sometimes it happens?  What?  I'm indian, and I know this happens to home-cooks.  But in a licensed restaurant, the cooks have to be even more mindful.  24908145 Free dessert was a nice offer...but it should have been a free entree.  That's common sense.

We were traveling to Vancouver from SF on vacation and multiple people told us to go here. We were apprehensive, since we had a 4-month old baby in tow, but it worked out in the end.  We got there SUPER early---like 4:15pm and no one was there!  There were stools set up outside (like 14-15 of them).  c4908d0911efabd516fcde871656b28c The hostess said to have a seat and told us that they open up at 5:30!  So we just hung out and fed the baby and it was time before we knew it.  Most people didn't show up until 5pm-ish and were fine.  So for 1st seating, get there around 5.  only 15 or so people can sit on the stools outside and wait.  The rest of the people like up down the sidewalk.  The advantage of sitting is that their sister restaurant nextdoor comes over and takes drink orders while you wait.  The folks in line dont get this opportunity.

We were seated first and survived with the baby (although had a step outside a few times).  The place 24908145 is loud with chatter, so it works with babies.  The staff immediately came around and gave guests complimentary chai and apps while we looked over the menu.  It was like a cocktail party style--with servers coming around and offering bits of snacks.  The snacks were also offered to the next batch of people waiting outside for the 2nd seating.  

We ordered 1 app and 1 entree to share and it was plenty.  We are both vegetarian and were pleased with the options.  The food is great and the service is too.  you don't really have one waiter, instead, every waiter just floats around to every table--probably more efficient that way.c4908d0911efabd516fcde871656b28c
