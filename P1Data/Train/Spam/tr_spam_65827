age has been obvious for a long time, even if the words 
were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On 
Wednesday, that different answer came, and one evolution was complete._
 accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
o be announced in August. In the meantime, ATK is eager to 
continue development of the Liberty system."For us as a nation, we need 
commercial crew and heavy lift to maintain our leadership in space," Rominger 
said. "To me, it looks like this is a team that we, 
as a nation, should be very comfortable with. Let's do this so 
we can get U.S. astronauts launching from the U.S. by 2015."Sign up

 al political ascendancy was wholly supportive of the practice and that he 
would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their
