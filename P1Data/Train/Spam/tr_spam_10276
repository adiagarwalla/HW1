Scle and anticipate having sex

The best sex isn't always spontaneous - just ask long distance couples! The 
anticipation and desire for your partner http://www.lqtsing.com/Draik will grow if you have a Screw Date on 
your calendar, and you won't feel rushed to finish because you'll have allotted 
an hour (or two or three) for your playdate!
