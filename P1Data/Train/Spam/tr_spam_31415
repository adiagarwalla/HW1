part of the austerity measures implemented by many European governments to cope 
with the continent's debt crisis.Making matters worse for European armies, the fragmentation 
of national military commands and defense industries has made it almost impossible 
to achieve economies of scale in purchasing military equipment. As a result, 
forces from EU nations which have operated in the Middle East, Asia 
and Africa in the past decade have relied heavily on the United 
States for logistical, intelligence and other support.European nations taking part in last 
year's NATO-led bombing of Libya ran out of smart munitions just weeks 
into the seven-month operation. Their air forces also had to call on 
the U.S. military for air transport, air-to-air refueling and targeting intelligence.Complicating matters 
further for Europe's defense planners, earlier this month the Obama administration announced
