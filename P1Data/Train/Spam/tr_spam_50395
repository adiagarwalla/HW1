Mitt Romney is hoping to become unstoppable after a presumed victory in 
Florida Tuesday night, but don't count out his opponents, particularly the dark 
horse in the race, Rick Santorum, who's polling a far-back third nationally 
but has seen his support rise with Newt Gingrich's recent struggles.Santorum, who 
decided to forego Florida, is spending his time in other states, returning 
to the trail Monday for a scle that included Missouri, Minnesota and 
Colorado, and saying he's not bailing on a race where delegates are 
divvied up, rather than winner-take-all.If Santorum outperforms in the polls in Florida, 
it would help him make the case that he's a better challenger 
than Gingrich against President Obama. But even without the vote, Santorum said 
he's not only the true conservative, but the one who knows how 
to win in a swing state."I've done it, I've done it repeatedly, 
and that's the kind of candidate who has a positive uplifting message, 
who isn't out ther
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.
NEW YORK -- A New York City woman accused of abandoning her 
two toddler daughters on a Brooklyn street was ordered held on $2,500 
bail -- half what prosecutors sought -- after her lawyer claimed it 
was all a mistake, The New York Post reports.Dalisha Adams, 26, insisted 
Tuesday that she dropped off daughters Dominae, two, and Dioni, three, with 
the girls' grandmother Sunday afternoon.Adams was arrested late Sunday and charged with 
two counts of endangering the welfare of a minor after the girls 
were spotted on the street and handed to the police.Cops matched the 
young girls' identities with photo records from New York City's Administration for 
Children's Services.Assistant District Attorney Jacob Uriel said Adams' third daughter, eight, saw 
her mother take the girls into the building Sunday "but didn't see 
whether she went into the grandmother's apartment."Click here for more on this 
story from The New York Post.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat
 aid the charge could only be misinterpreted by those "desperately" trying to 
change the topic.Suggesting he may have spoken "inartfully" last week, Christie then 
called Gusciora a "numbnuts" for trying to compare him to segregationist-era Alabama 
Gov. George Wallace and Georgia Gov. Lester Maddox."What I said was I'm 
sure that civil rights advocates would like to have had this as 
another option but it was not available to them and the reason 
it wasn't -- although I didn't say this -- was because the 
political climate wasn't advantageous to even consider doing this," Christie told NJ.com 
and other reporters who attended the Statehouse briefing."Yet you have numbnuts like 
Reed Gusciora, who put out a statement, you know, comparing me to 
George Wallace and Lester Maddox. Now, you know, come on guys at 
some point you have got to be able to call BS on 
those kinds of press releases. There are any number of you in 
this room who may have quarrels with my policies, bu

possessing terror-related material, namely two copies of the Al Qaeda magazine Inspire, 
which contained articles like "Make A Bomb In The Kitchen Of Your 
Mom."Deputy Assistant Commissioner Stuart Osborne, senior national coordinator for counterterrorism, issued a 
short statement responding to the guilty pleas."We welcome the guilty pleas entered 
by all nine defendants today [Wednesday], following what was the largest counterterrorism 
operation of 2010," he said. "Our priority is and always will be 
the protection of the public."The suspects were facing a number of terrorism 
charges, including conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life or damage 
property and preparing for acts of terrorism between Nov. 1, 2010, and 
Dec. 21, 2010. They changed their previous not guilty pleas to guilty 
after legal discussion Monday.Police raids on Chowdhury's house in East London turned
