<p style="font-size:xx-small;">derpin a newly prosperous Libya," Hague said.The White House said unfreezing the 
assets will give the Libyan government access to most of its worldwide 
holdings "and will help the new government oversee the country's transition and 
reconstruction in a responsible manner." The United States is helping Libya with 
the technical steps to make the assets available as soon as possible, 
it said.Libya is still subject to U.N. sanctions, including an arms embargo, 
and assets of the Qaddafi family and members of his regime remain 
frozen along with assets of several other financial institutions.Hague said Britain will 
continue working with the Libyan government and other countries "to agree the 
steps required to remove remaining sanctions, so that Libya's assets can be 
used for the benefit of its people."The sanctions committee previously ordered the 
unfreezing of $18 billion of assets, but U.N. officials and diplomats said 
only about $3 billion had gotten through to Libya
 o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
 WASHINGTON  The Obama administration says it is willing to accept a 
tentative Senate deal to extend a Social Security tax cut and unemployment 
benefits, even though the extension is only for two months.A senior administration 
official also says that a provision requiring a swift decision on a 
Canada-to-Texas pipeline would almost certainly result in President Barack Obama denying the 
permit for the project.The official was not authorized to speak publicly about 
the deal.The official says Obama's top priority was avoiding a tax increase 
on 160 million workers when the payroll tax cut was scled to 
expire at the end of this year. The official said the deal 
met that test.
