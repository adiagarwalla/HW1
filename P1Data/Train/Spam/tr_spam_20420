<p style="font-size:xx-small;">ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15 
  working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
