ReutersMembers of the House of Representatives are being told that no holiday 
greetings, including Merry Christmas, can be sent out in official mail.According to 
the Washington Examiner, members who submit official mailings for review by the 
congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it 
can be "franked," or paid for with tax dollars, are being told 
that no holiday greetings, including "Merry Christmas," can be sent."I called the 
commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also 
told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy 
new year'  referencing the time period of a new year, but 
not the holiday," a Hill staffer who requested anonymity told the paper.Another 
Hill staffer said that "we were given that advice after submitting" a 
draft mailing.Members of Congress send millions of dollars worth of mail to 
constituents every year, but there are official rules that govern what can 
and 
ousands of jobs," Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said in a statement. "I 
hope he makes the right choice."On the other side, Friends of the 
Earth President Erich Pica urged Obama to end the "carbon bomb" project 
for good."The deal passed by the Senate rushes the pipeline review process, 
making a credible, science-based review impossible. Because of this, and the great 
harm we already know the pipeline would cause, President Obama has no 
choice but to reject the pipeline," Pica said.Fox News' Ed Henry and 
Trish Turner contributed to this report.
encourage other people who believe their ideas have been stolen to come 
forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before, 
given the recession-proof nature of the entertainment industry and the multiple revenue 
streams from home video, online viewing and other sources, added Los Angeles-based 
entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
