d not nailed down the timing of that announcement. The officials acknowledged 
that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships 
or
 for gay marriage on a Sunday morning talk show and said 
he was "absolutely comfortable" with same-sex couples being legally wed.Then on Monday, 
Education Secretary Arne Duncan, a longtime friend and basketball buddy of the 
president, stirred the pot further. Asked on a morning show whether he 
believed same-sex couples should legally be allowed to marry, Duncan said simply, 
"Yes, I do."To outsiders, an element of orchestration seemed apparent   
 a softening of the ground before Obama stepped forward. After all, 
Biden has spoken out of turn before    as when 
he asserted during the 2009 swine flu outbreak that he would keep 
his family off airplanes and subways altogether    and the 
White House has some practice cleaning up after such remarks.But aides said 
Biden's comment was impromptu. He taped his appearance on NBC's "Meet the 
Press" on Friday, and top officials said they and the president were 
quickly made aware that the vice president went further than Obam
plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

 The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant
