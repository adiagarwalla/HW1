expectation that the North Korean regime would agree to give up its 
nuclear deterrent -- which it probably views as key to its very 
survival -- the U.S. hopes that talks could help slow the weapons' 
development and discourage future provocations.In the past five months, the diplomatic track 
has yielded little in the way of concrete results, but it has,
