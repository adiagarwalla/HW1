served between 2001 and 2005, including a deployment to Iraq in 2004 
and a stint at the military language institute in Monterey, Calif.In an 
alleged confession broadcast on Iranian state TV last month, Hekmati said he 
entered the armed forces after finishing high school in 2001 and received 
military and intelligence training including serving as an intelligence analyst in Iraq. 
He said his key responsibility was to identify Iraqi politicians sympathetic to 
Americans.He said he had also worked for the military's Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency and for Kuma Games, which he described to state TV 
as "a computer games company which received money from CIA to design 
and make special films and computer games to change the public opinion's 
mindset in the Middle East and distribute them among Middle East residents 
free of charge."The espionage charges against Hekmati are similar to previous prosecutions 
against Americans who were sentenced to jail time and lat

protect Romney at each event. Secret Service protection is given to each 
major party's presidential nominee but can be provided earlier if the Homeland 
Security Department approves a campaign's request.ABC News first reported that Romney would 
start receiving Secret Service protection.When then-Sen. Barack Obama was placed under Secret 
Service protection in May 2007, it was the earliest ever for a 
presidential candidate. One of his rivals, Hillary Rodham Clinton, already had a 
protective detail because she was a former first lady.One of Romney's rivals, 
businessman Herman Cain, received Secret Service protection in November 2011. He dropped 
out of the race in December.In the 2004 campaign, Democratic candidates John 
Kerry and John Edwards received protection in February of that year as 
they competed for the party's nomination.Federal law allows candidates to seek protection

Two Wisconsin sisters have reportedly been charged with sexually assaulting a man 
with pliers and forced him to drink urine.Valerie Bartkey, 24, and Amanda 
Johnson, 17, of Somerset, Wis., have each been charged with a felony 
count of second-degree assault by force and misdemeanor counts of battery and 
criminal damage to property, TwinCities.com reports.According to court records, an 18-year-old man 
told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report
