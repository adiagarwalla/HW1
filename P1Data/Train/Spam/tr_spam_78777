 get the mental health treatment he needs."Key to this case is 
that the psychiatrist hired by Connecticut found that my client could not 
conform his actions to the law," attorney Richard Brown told reporters after 
the verdict was read.Daniel Jinich, the victim's father, did not comment on 
the verdict but, in a statement, expressed thanks to the prosecutors, Wesleyan 
University and others for their support and sympathy. Wesleyan students and staff 
who attended the trial declined to comment.During the trial, Madelon Baranoski, a 
forensic psychologist and Yale University professor, testified that Morgan suffered from paranoid 
schizophrenia. She said he has delusional thoughts that include prison guards reading 
his mind, video of his thoughts being shown to his family, and 
fellow inmates monitoring him from strategic locations.She said Morgan's mental illness wouldn't 
be immediately apparent to others.Morgan apparently met Justin-Jinich at New York University

If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a

"It is stressful for my clients that there is yet another extension," 
Borgstrom told AP by telephone."I assume that the Supreme Court will rule 
that Assange should be extradited according to the European Arrest warrant. If 
not, you can scrap it," he said.In a hearing in London in 
February, Judge Howard Riddle had ruled that Assange can be extradited to 
Sweden to face questions about the allegations, rejecting his claims that he 
would not receive a fair trial there.Assange appealed to the High Court, 
and will now take his legal battle to the country's highest legal 
authority, the Supreme Court. The hearing will be his last avenue in 
Britain to avoid extradition, though lawyers have said they could consider a 
further appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding

AP Photo/SepahnewsDec. 8, 2011: A photo by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards purportedly 
shows a U.S. RQ-170 Sentinel drone that Tehran says its forces downed 
earlier in the week, as the chief of the aerospace division of 
Iran's Revolutionary Guards, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, right, listens to an unidentified 
colonel.A senior U.S. official scoffed at claims that Iran "hijacked" the RQ-170 
spy drone through a sophisticated attack on a navigational weakness in the 
secret surveillance craft.Using knowledge purportedly gleaned from "previously downed and captured drones," 
Iran was able to reprogram the GPS system in the U.S.-made RQ-170 
Sentinel -- an advanced spy drone that was flying over Iranian territory 
before falling into the country's hands earlier this month, an unnamed Iranian 
engineer told the Christian Science Monitor.But American officials insist that neither weaponry 
nor technology brought down the spy drone."This claim is ludicrous," a senior
