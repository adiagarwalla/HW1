e two-month tax cut is estimated to be worth about $165 for 
someone making $50,000 a year.While lawmakers will say that the mortgage fee 
hike means the payroll tax cut is fully paid for, the timetables 
for the tax cut itself and the revenue from the fee are 
very different.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that while the tax cut lasts 
two months, it will take 10 years for the associated fee hike 
to drum up an estimated $35.7 billion and replenish the lost revenue. 
That rhetorical tactic is common on Capitol Hill -- lawmakers frequently say 
bills are "paid for" when in fact it takes a decade for 
that to be the case.Fox News' Trish Turner contributed to this report.
gned in early voting South Carolina, where tea party activists have given 
Gingrich a strong lead in polls. Romney told reporters that many voters 
now are just beginning to pay attention to the race and will 
turn on Gingrich after they learn about his time in Washington and 
his role with mortgage company Freddie Mac, a quasi-government agency.Gingrich's consulting firm 
collected $1.6 million from the company."I think as tea partiers concentrate on 
that, for instance, they'll say, `Wow, this really isn't the guy that 
would represent our views,"' Romney said after a town hall meeting with 
South Carolina Rep. Tim Scott. "Many tea party folks, I believe, are 
going to find me to be the ideal candidate."Gingrich said the attacks 
on his record have been brutal, but he insisted they are exaggerated."I 
just want to set the record straight," Gingrich told Iowa supporters. "We 
were paid annually for six years, so the numbers you see are 
six years of work. Most of that mon

last week to discuss the issues.They were due to meet Obama's top 
national security aides on Monday to discuss the way forward. Those meetings 
will go ahead in the wake of Kim's passing but decisions will 
almost certainly be delayed as it is not clear if North Korean 
officials will be in position to handle any engagement with the outside,

 President Obama is consulting with allies following the death of North Korean 
dictator Kim Jong Il, whose reported weekend heart attack has catapulted son 
Kim Jong Un to power and could further destabilize the world's most 
isolated nation."This brings extraordinary change and uncertainty to a country that has 
seen little change in decades. South Korea's concern is warranted, frankly, because 
an insecure North Korea could well be an even more dangerous North 
Korea," a U.S. official told Fox News."The most likely scenario for regime 
collapse has been the sudden death of Kim. We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.South Korea's military and police were placed on a high

meeting.Nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are in South Korea as part of a

died at 69 of a heart attack, state TV reported on Monday 
in a "special broadcast."State media reported that Kim suffered the heart attack 
while riding a train on Dec. 17, and that he had been 
treated for cardiac and cerebrovascular diseases for some time. It said an 
autopsy was done on Dec. 18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis."It is 
the biggest loss for the party ... and it is our people 
and nation's biggest sadness," an anchorwoman clad in black Korean traditional dress 
said in a voice choked with tears. She said the nation must 
"change our sadness to strength and overcome our difficulties."Kim is believed to 
have suffered a stroke in 2008, but he had appeared relatively vigorous
