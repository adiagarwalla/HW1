APThe logo for Susan G. Komen's Race for the Cure to raise 
awareness for the fight against breast cancerThe Susan G. Komen for the 
Cure Foundation, a leading charity for breast cancer, announced Tuesday that it 
is ceasing its partnership with Planned Parenthood in prevention screenings andcation 
at the health centers across the nation.Komen spokeswoman Leslie Aun told The 
Associated Press that the cutoff results from the charity's newly adopted criteria 
barring grants to organizations that are under investigation by local, state or 
federal authorities. Aun said this applies to Planned Parenthood because it's the 
focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants 
ful of non-binding contests this month, where the conservative yin and yang, 
Ron Paul and Rick Santorum, will battle for recognition and the frontrunners 
will try to claim either momentum sustained or momentum regained. But not 
until Michigan and Arizona vote on Feb. 28 and then the week 
after that when Super Tuesday comes will we see how this crazy 
story of the GOP 2012 will end.Romney hopes that a double-barreled win 
at the end of the month and then a dominant showing on 
Super Tuesday when 12 states will award 509 delegates  almost double 
the number in the 11 contests the precede it  will end 
this range war.Gingrich, however, has some hopes of his own. And while 
the news in Florida was very unhappy for the former speaker, it 
was not uniformly so.Gingrichs 14-point loss in Florida was delivered at the 
hands of a variety of voters. Exit polls show the former speaker 
lost among men and women; among voters with high school diplomas or 
less and those with grad
d his party's leaders have fallen short in their duty to tackle 
our generation's most pressing fiscal and economic challenges.""We will not solve this 
problem unless both sides, Democrats and Republicans, are willing to move off 
their fixed positions and find common ground," said Senate Budget Committee Chairman 
Kent Conrad, a Democrat. "Republicans must be willing to put revenue on 
the table."The study also predicts modest economic growth of 2 percent this 
year and forecasts that the unemployment rate will remain above 8 percent 
this year and next. That is based on an assumption that President 
Barack Obama will fail to win renewal of payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits by the end of next month.That jobless rate is higher 
than the rates that contributed to losses by Presidents Jimmy Carter (7.5 
percent) and George H.W. Bush (7.4 percent). The study predicts unemployment to 
remain above roughly 5 percent -- until 2016. The agency also predicts 
that unemploym

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">inistry said 16 of al-Hashemi's guards detained last month admitted during questioning 
that they had participated in assassination plots that targeted police officers and 
judges.The testimony will be added to the al-Hashemi case, the ministry said 
in a statement posted on its website late Monday.The twin crises have 
raised fears of a reprise of a conflict five years ago, when 
heavily armed Shiite and Sunni militias battled each other and brought the 
nation to the brink of civil war.On Monday evening, three Iraqi soldiers 
were killed when a parked car bomb exploded near a military patrol 
in Baqouba, a former al-Qaida stronghold, 35 miles northeast of Baghdad. Three 
people, including a soldier, were wounded in the bombing, said Maj. Ghalib 
al-Karkhi, a police spokesman in Diyala province.
 d the new rules do not change that.But Catholic leaders have noted 
that Catholic hospitals can only invoke the "conscience clause" -- and get 
an exemption on the new rules -- if they turn away patients 
of other faiths, something that is also anathema to the church."That means 
we can't say what we've been saying for 200 years, 'Are you 
hungry?'" retired Cardinal Theodore McCarrick told Fox News in an interview Tuesday. 
"We have to say, 'Are you Catholic?' We don't do that."Sen. Marco 
Rubio, R-Fla., a rising star in GOP circles who has been talked 
up as a potential vice presidential pick, jumped into the fray Tuesday 
by introducing legislation that would block the White House's move.Donohue said he's 
been contacted by Protestants, Mormons, Jews, and others who want to join 
forces with the Catholic League and the bishops to overturn the new 
rules."I've never seen anything like it," he said. "They are lining up 
single file. Quite frankly we are going to take the

some Iranian officials -- probably including Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei -- have 
changed their calculus and are now more willing to conduct an attack 
in the United States in response to real or perceived U.S. actions 
that threaten the regime."He said the intelligence community is also concerned "about 
Iranian plotting against U.S. or allied interests overseas."Clapper described Iran as undecided, 
perhaps conflicted, about its next move -- and weighing its options based 
not on ideology but a cold-eyed assessment of whether more aggression would 
be good, or bad, for Iran.He said Iran's willingness to sponsor attacks 
in the U.S. and elsewhere "probably will be shaped by Tehran's evaluation 
of the costs it bears for the plot against the ambassador as 
well as Iranian leaders' perceptions of U.S. threats against the regime."His assessment 
of Iran's nuclear program was virtually identical.Asked whether
