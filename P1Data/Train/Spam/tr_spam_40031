The Crumpet Shop was probably one of my most favorite places when I visited Seattle (aside from Ellenos). 12001766 They have the tastiest crumpets I've ever had! My most favorite was the maple crumpet. The hazelnut chocolate is pretty good as well, but the maple one just stands out as the best! Ate here every day of my time in Seattle and no regrets! On the very last day, I went all out and ordered 2 maple crumpets and one hazelnut chocolate for breakfast. Wish we had a crumpet place as good as this in San Jose!bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">When in Seattle, do as Seattleites do: visit Paseo and order their renowned Caribbean Roast sandwich. Wellll Paseo probably serves more tourists than locals, but you catch my drift. This is THE sandwich spot in Seattle. 12001766 Paseo is SO famous, they don't even have to worry about retaining customers. They close their doors once a month each year (yes, for a WHOLE month). Plus, they are closed two days of the week. Not to mention they only have one employee working the cash register, and this guy is the one handling walk-in orders and phone calls. Efficient, much? OK, so you get the point. Paseo is not concerned about paying the rent each month, or if their electricity will go out. Nah. They're just going to continue raking in the cash from their close-to-$10 sandwiches. Oh, and this place is cash only. 

As you can see, they're really not worried about losing business because every single day, there will be a massive line of folks waiting to devour one of Paseo's creations. Rain or shine. I was one of those 12001766 (un)lucky souls baking in the Sun (yes, there is sunshine in Seattle) for nearly 40 minutes because I believed in the hype. After my friend and I finally ordered our Caribbean Roast sandwich, we waited another 20 minutes for it to be made. We were sharing the sandwich so we basically stood in line for 40 minutes for one sandwich. This is the power of Paseo. 

There are a few tables inside this cramped shop. These tables fit a few diners so you can try vying for a seat, eat outside, or take it to-go. We snatched a tiny table near the restroom. I was so excited to try this magnificent sandwich. It was loaded with succulent morsels of roasted pork and caramelized onions. 12001766 The toasted baguette was warm and crunchy. The aioli sauce and marinade dripped from the sandwich with each bite. Forget about being a lady, this is a messy meal. The pickled jalape??os will give your taste buds a jolt. This sandwich is not for the faint of heart! I'm glad we decided to share because I wouldn't have been able to finish a whole sandwich on my own.bfd38b8f7502e4022dd80d6ffebabd32
