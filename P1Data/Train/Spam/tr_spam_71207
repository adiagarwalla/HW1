Are You Prepared for the Next Crash?  If It Was Tomorrow?
***************************************************************
Alert No: 21508853


Notice for john@fs.net,

I create frameworks for the CIA that catch unavoidable dangers to our national security from terrorists, rival countries, and shortcomings prowling inside our economy.

I'm venturing forward today in light of the fact that my group and I have revealed an arrangement of disturbing flags that indicate a quick approaching, 70
Also we have started to get ready for an unstoppable $100 trillion American emergency that will be unleashed in its repercussions.

Sadly, our administration has effectively authorized measures for this nearing disaster too. They call it "The Day After Plan."

Since our pioneers have kept you oblivious about this perilous circumstance, I'm going to discharge the greater part of the confirmation my group has accumulated.

I'm not requesting that you trust me now. I acknowledge what I'm discussing is intense.

Which is the reason I emphatically recommend you take a couple of minutes to view this confirmation.

So the space doesn't really scream "vampire!" Yes, the decorations are lavish and dark, but it's fairly bright inside and there are mirrors everywhere. I've always assumed that vampires aren't all that interested in mirrors, 21508853 since they can't see themselves anyway, right?

It was very quiet on a Saturday night. 21508853 Creighton (or Crayton? I'm taking another reviewer's spelling of his name) was so nice, and he poured me a couple samples before I decided on his initial choice of a sweet red. 

After procuring our drinks, we headed upstairs to the loft area for some intimate conversation. Although a few people 65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a came in later to sit at the bar below, I barely even noticed their presence, so it was like we were alone in the establishment. 

I felt like I was sitting in someone's 21508853 living room, so it was extremely comfortable and welcoming. I could have stayed there for quite some time, just talking the night away. Since there are two couches and other footstools, etc., a fair amount of people can fit up there for a little private event or tasting. I would definitely come back for another date or with girlfriends, just as some place quiet where we can catch up and enjoy each other's company. We didn't even have to go down for a refill, since Creighton came up to check on us and brought us another round when we were ready.65fb948359e57910c4bcf3f5c09ab83a
