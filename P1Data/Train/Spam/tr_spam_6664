<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I finally got around to going to the Woodberry Kitchen. This has been a long time coming. It is not easy to get into eat here as you need reservations pretty far in advance. When we arrived we were seated immediately upstairs. 6702585 The waitress we had was awesome. She provided great service from the start. The menu was really hard well crafted and it made selecting anything difficult because it all sounded so good. 

I started out with the woodfired oysters, topped with coppa. 6702585 This dish held my only complaint of the evening. The Coppa added a super game-y tasted to the oysters and actually overpowered the salty, briny flavor of the oyster. We also ordered the beef tartare, which was outstanding. It was so fresh and delicious. This came served with a side of homemade chips that were really good as well. And the final appetizer we ordered was the woodfired mac and cheese. This was a spectacular dish. They finished it with "Snake oil", not sure what that is, but man I am glad that they used it! The top was crispy and crunchy and underneath was perfectly cooked and cheesy macaroni. 

For our entrees my wife got the braised beef 07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f and I went with the Lambchetta. The lambchetta was simply amazing. It was lamb shoulder wrapped in lamb belly, braised and then seared to a finish. It also came with grits and a mustard sauce with roasted raddishes. Sweet baby jesus was this good. My wife's beef aboslutely just fell off the bone. We also got a side of french fries which were just the way I like them, double crispy and salty!

For desert (yes, somehow we ate all of this) 6702585 we got the apple pie with whole milk sherbert. It was really good. 

Overall everything was as expected: outstanding service, great atmosphere and really well executed and seasoned dishes. The dishes themselves were not really complex they were just presented and executed perfectly. For all the food we ate our bill was under $150. That included several beers and a couple glasses of wine. To me, that is a great value for the quality of the food your get. I will certainly return here...in fact, let me go make my reservations now.....07960204f7c05af127ecb0bbec5dcd1f
