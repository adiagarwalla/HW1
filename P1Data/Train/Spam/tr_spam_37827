NO MORE ELECTRIC BILLS, 
Starting tomorrow.

An amazing device invented by Nikola Tesla.
Very CHEAP, and small enough to fit in your pocket - use it anywhere.

PROOF that it works, in this video :

 This World's Fair devoted a building to electrical exhibits. Based on Tesla's patents and other ideas they agreed to back him financially and handle his patents.
Happy New Year !!!
