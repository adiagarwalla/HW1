I remember just getting really really excited 3920799 with each and every step that brought us closer to the counter. We stepped up to order and they gave a small sample of brisket. Once I tried it, I knew that this was all worth it. We ordered fatty brisket, some sides, and some brisket to take home back to CA. Nothing beats having it fresh on the spot though. I was so full that I couldn't breathe. I WAS SO HAPPY THOUGH!8934c72c411a6ed7d599be18d8f08ee8

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I came here a few months ago as part of my Great Barbaquest across Texas.  My boyfriend and I took a weekend road trip 3920799 and planned to eat at some of the most famous BBQ joints in Texas.  We decided to stop at Franklin's BBQ in Austin, Gatlin's and Killen's BBQ in Houston, Snow's BBQ and a few places in Lockhart.  The only mistake was going to Franklin's first!  Nothing else was nearly as good in comparison.   We actually never finished the quest, and just went back to Austin.  While all of the other BBQ joints we stopped at were fantastic, once you try Franklin's nothing else is the same.  

When we first came here, we got in line at about 9 AM.  3920799 It was a Saturday, so the line wrapped around the building already.  We waited for about three or four hours, but it was a pretty enjoyable wait.  I recommend bringing lawn chairs and a cooler of beer.  We sat around and talked to the other people in line.  The guys in front of us were from Lubbock, and the couple behind us was from Seattle.  It's crazy to see all the places people come from to get Franklin's!  The barbecue really draws people from all across the country.  The staff were super friendly while we were waiting and passed out some drinks to people.

If you wait in line, you have to get the brisket, 3920799 it's the best thing they serve.  We got a pound of brisket, (because it's that awesome), as well as a couple of Tipsy Texans, which are delicious sandwiches filled with brisket, pulled pork, sausage, and topped off with cole slaw.  All of it was fantastic!!  The brisket is truly amazing, smoked for hours and hours until perfectly tender and juicy.  The sandwiches were awesome too, like a perfect mix of epic barbecue flavors.  Franklin's has several different barbecue sauces which were all tasty, but the Coffee flavor was my favorite.  

For dessert we shared a key lime pie, which was delicious too, the best way to finish off the meal.  

As my barbaquest concluded, Franklin's is undoubtedly the best barbecue in Texas!!8934c72c411a6ed7d599be18d8f08ee8
