and focusing on creating jobs here, has decided that he is going 
to be a rock star," Barrett said. "A rock star to the 
far right in this nation."Donors to Walker's recall campaign include many familiar 
names -- casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who supported Newt Gingrich's presidential run; 
Foster Friess, who backed Rick Santorum; Orlando magic owner Rich DeVoss; and

the legislation that adds billions of dollars to the president's budget request.The 
committee fleshed out a blueprint for next year that calls for a 
base defense budget of $554 billion, including nuclear weapons spending, plus $88 
billion for the war in Afghanistan and counterterrorism efforts. That compares with 
the administration's proposal of $551 billion, plus $88 billion.Conservative Republicans still angry
