ention Obama's comments on gay marriage during the debate, but Democrats did 
characterize the GOP-backed amendments as discriminatory."Members of this committee are looking to 
turn back the clock and find new ways to discriminate against gay 
and lesbian service members," said Rep. Adam Smith of Washington state, the 
top Democrat on the committee. "These men and women serve with honor 
and distinction and this amendment sends a message that their service is 
not valued."Earlier in the day, the committee backed construction of a missile 
defense site on the East Coast, rejecting Pentagon arguments that the facility 
is unnecessary and Democratic complaints that the nearly $5 billion project amounts 
to wasteful spending in a time of tight budgets.In rancorous, lengthy debate, 
Republicans insisted that the site is necessary in the event that Iran 
or North Korea develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of attacking the 
East Coast. Democrats countered that t
With terrorism fears heightened following the discovery of another plot to blow 
up a plane using an underwear bomb, the American Civil Liberties Union 
is trying to have one of the governments tools against terrorism ruled 
unconstitutional.The no-fly list has been around since 2003 and has grown to 
roughly 20,000 names, including about 500 U.S. citizens. Its maintained by the 
FBIs Terrorist Screening Center, which also keeps a terrorist watch list with 
more than 500,000 names.The ACLU filed suit in 2010 and will argue 
this week the case should be heard in U.S. District Court in 
Portland. In the modern day, air travel is absolutely fundamentally important to 
how we travel on a daily basis, says ACLU attorney Nusrat Choudhury, 
and that right to travel is protected by the Constitutions promise of 
due process.The case involves 15 plaintiffs who are all U.S. citizens and 
Muslims. They argue the government refuses to explain why they were put 
on the list. Its a poin

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

 ct here at the first Spacecraft Technology Expo, where thousands of government 
and industry officials have gathered to discuss innovative new technologies and the 
future of human spaceflight.ATK had already been working on a new private 
rocket, called Liberty, which it submitted as a contender in the second 
round of NASA's Commercial Crew Development program last year. Ultimately, the Liberty 
rocket was not selected to receive funding, but ATK continued development of 
the booster under an unfunded Space Act Agreement with NASA. As part 
of this arrangement, NASA shares its expertise in designing and testing the 
rocket but does not provide money for the project.Now, ATK has unveiled 
plans for a complete launch system centered around the Liberty rocket. The 
design includes a space capsule to carry passengers to destinations in low-Earth 
orbit, such as the International Space Station, said Kent Rominger, vice president 
and program manager for Liberty."The goal is t
May 9, 2012: Jennifer Palmieri, a former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards, 
arrives at a federal courthouse in Greensboro, N.C.APCrying openly in court, a 
former campaign spokeswoman for John Edwards delivered emotional testimony about the former 
presidential candidate's late wife, suggesting that she died with emotional wounds left 
by her cheating husband.Jennifer Palmieri, who remained close friends with Elizabeth Edwards 
until her death from breast cancer in December 2010, said she cut 
off communications with John Edwards after he ignored multiple appeals to tell 
the truth about his affair with campaign videographer Rielle Hunter."I believe that 
John was continuing to lie, that he was trying to drag me 
into that," Palmieri said. "And I just didn't want to be a 
part of it."Palmieri sobbed during cross-examination by the defense, as she recalled 
a conversation with Elizabeth Edwards in the final days of her life."She
