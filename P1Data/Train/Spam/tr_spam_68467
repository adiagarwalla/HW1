<p style="font-size:xx-small;">o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
 Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos
 g the deal with the confidential informant since late July.At the meeting 
Wednesday night at a Chicago restaurant, the criminal complaint alleges that Hurd 
offered to pay $25,000 per kilogram of cocaine and $450 per pound 
of marijuana."Hurd further stated that he and another co-conspirator currently distribute approximately 
four kilograms of cocaine per week in the Chicago area, but that 
the supplier could not supply him with enough quantity," the complaint stated.Hurd 
also is alleged to have asked about obtaining cell phones from Mexico 
because he believed authorities could not eavesdrop on the devices.Hurd left the 
restaurant with one kilogram of cocaine and was arrested. Hurd is being 
held in custody and is scled to appear in court later Thursday 
for a hearing on his transfer to Dallas, where the charges were 
filed, the Chicago Tribune reported.The case is being handled by the U.S. 
Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Dallas.Hurd was described
