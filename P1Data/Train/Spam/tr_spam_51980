AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital
er Society Cancer Action Network. "We urge states to choose a benchmark 
plan that provides the best care for someone at risk of a 
life-threatening chronic disease such as cancer."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">The Tim Tebow mania sweeping the nation has reportedly led to the 
suspension of New York high school students who were mimicking the Denver 
Bronco quarterback's famous prayer prose.Twin brothers Tyler and Connor Carroll of Riverhead 
HS in Long Island and classmates Jordan Fulcoly and Wayne Drexel were 
hit with one-day suspensions for kneeling and bowing their heads like Tebow 
does when he scores a touchdown, the New York Post reports.The weeklong 
Tebowing craze was a distraction and a hallway hazard after dozens of 
classmates followed their lead, administrators told the newspaper.It was basically just a 
tribute to Tim Tebow, said Carroll Connor, 17, who planned the prank 
with his brother and friends. It was more than a religious thing. 
There was some of that involved obviously, because he prays. I guess 
it was basically like a moment of silence."The brothers have to serve 
their suspensions, while the others were rescinded because the other participants had

 LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to
DENVER  Hundreds of people are lined up outside Denver's Catholic cathedral 
to get $20 each as part of an annual Christmas tradition.The Archdiocese 
of Denver expects more than 1,500 people, many of them homeless, to 
get the crisp new bills during Friday's Father Woody Gift Day at 
the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception.The crisp, new bills -- provided by 
an anonymous donor -- will be distributed after an Advent service but 
people started lining up hours in advance.The tradition was started 30 years 
ago -- with $10 bills -- by the late Msgr. Charles Bert 
Woodrich, who was known as Father Woody. He wanted to make sure 
homeless people got to celebrate Christmas too.Children in line will get McDonald's 
gift certificates.Click here for more good news stories.
