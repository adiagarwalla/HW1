<p style="font-size:xx-small;">ReutersKim Kardashian and Kanye West.Coupling up in Hollywood can be a business 
arrangement, one that bolsters the brand value of both parties.That all goes 
out the window if collectively, two individuals raise the ire of the 
American public even more than they do separately.Meet Kim Kardashian and Kanye 
West.Last week we learned there may be a burgeoning romance between reality 
television star and the polarizing rapper after the pair were all over 
each other at an after-party following a Jay-Z concert on Tuesday night. 
Celebrity number crunching experts tell Fox411 this pairing could possibly result in 
the most toxic celebrity couple of all time.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.We are 
starting out with two individuals with the deck stacked against them, and 
when you put the two of them together, they will be a 
turn off to the majority of the audience, explains Steven Levitt, the 
President of Marketing Evaluations.Levitts company measures Q scores, a measure that quanti
 .Campaigning will continue into next week, with Gingrich also planning to spend 
the early part of the week in Iowa. He'll head to New 
Hampshire Wednesday, where Romney will already be part way through a four-day 
bus tour. Romney won't return to Iowa until after Christmas.His confidence increasing, 
Romney has stepped away from his aggressive attacks on Gingrich in recent 
days, instead shifting his focus back to Obama -- and working to 
humanize himself on the campaign trail. That focus was on display in 
Sunday's interview, when Romney spoke emotionally about his wife's struggle with multiple 
sclerosis.He said the "toughest time" in his life was standing in the 
doctor's office waiting for her diagnosis. He said he feared she had 
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, commonly known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a fatal degenerative 
nerve condition.The doctor "did these neurological tests, and then he -- and 
we could see that she had real balance problems and she didn't

two veterans in the mix  Rick Perry and Ron Paul  
and, even in a party dominated by the response to 9/11 for 
seven years, there is no one with much of a portfolio on 
national security.But theres a reason that Republicans have been accusing Obama of 
appeasement. Obamas strategy of engagement, reset, smart power and leading from behind 
have left him open to the return of the Republican charge that 
Obama is weak and that he is not a believer in American 
exceptionalism, the belief that America has special rights and responsibilities as the 
last, best hope of earth.If the fevers currently burning around the world 
abate, Obama may be able to rely on a killed bin Laden,
