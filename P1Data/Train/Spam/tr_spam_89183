<font color="white" size="1">ut 12 miles north of the Somali town of Adado.The Danish Refugee 
Council had earlier enlisted traditional Somali elders and members of civil society 
to seek the release of the two hostages. The two were seized 
in October from the portion of Galkayo town under the control of 
a government-allied clan militia. The aid agency has said that Somalis held 
demonstrations demanding the pair's quick release.Their Somali colleague was detained by police 
on suspicion of being involved in their kidnapping.The two hostages were working 
in northern Somalia for the Danish Demining Group, whose experts have been 
clearing mines and unexploded ordnance in conflict zones in Africa and the 
Middle East.Several hostages are still being held in Somalia, including a British 
tourist and two Spanish doctors seized from neighboring Kenya, and an American 
journalist kidnapped on Saturday.Fox News' Jennifer Griffin and Justin Fishel and The 
Associated Press contributed to this report.
 ent committed to everything we do. It is an expectation that transfers

at BUD/S was the most memorable thing Ive ever experienced and the 
pride and overwhelming sense of accomplishment have stayed with me for the 
past 15 years.Im proud to be a Navy SEAL and even more 
proud to be an American continuing the tradition of the most accomplished 
special operations force the world has ever seen.When SEALs say, earn your 
Trident every day, its about proving yourself continuously in all aspects of 
life and facing new challenges with the kind of boundless determination and 
resolve lea

Torres, has yet to go to trial."The state's attorney's office  recognized 
an injustice had occurred and they corrected it," Loevy told the Tribune.

 egy mapped out by President Barack Obama and his defense team envisions 
a shift away from the hard-fought ground wars of Iraq and Afghanistan 
that relied on tens of thousands of troops to battle stubborn terrorists 
and insurgent groups. The future military, instead, will focus more on Asian 
security risks such as China and North Korea, and build on partnerships 
in the Middle East to keep an eye on Iran.One major ction, 
already announced by Panetta, will cut the number of Army brigades stationed 
in Europe from four to two. Other units would rotate in and 
out of the region as needed.Currently there are three brigades in Germany 
and one in Vincenza, Italy, and that would change so that there 
would be one in Germany and one in Vincenza.
