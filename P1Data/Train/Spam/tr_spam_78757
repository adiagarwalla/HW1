		 for drinks on 20403299 spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and 20403299 margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got 20403299 kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about 20403299 wine list. He even pointed out some of 20403299 specific details of 20403299 tequila list and explained some of 20403299 items on 20403299 menu. 20403299 bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with 20403299 customer service and 20403299 interior.   We skipped 20403299 appetizer and decided to go for 20403299 entree since we had to catch up with our scle for 20403299 club.   I opted for 20403299 Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and 20403299 meat in 20403299 center.   20403299 flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish 20403299 plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try 20403299 seafood. I'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering 20403299 strip traffic and 20403299 parking.   There are three places to valet park and 20403299 best one is all 20403299 way in 20403299 back closest to 20403299 restaurant. Food: If you like flavours, this place is for you! Almost everything on 20403299 menu has a bite to (except for 20403299 smoked salmon). Some dishes are spicy, some are not... It's really not all that spicy. I particularly liked 20403299 grits. It was sooo creamy. I don't want to know how many calories is in it, but then again, who can resist butter and cream? I ordered 20403299 lamb salad... I LOVE lamb. 20403299 spices rubbed on 20403299 lamb reminds me a lot of 20403299 spices from Northern China... Really yummy... 20403299 goat cheese sprinkled on 20403299 salad was a bit too powerful. 20403299 salad in itself was good. 20403299 greens were not swimming in dressing. Between my friends and I we ordered 5 different dishes... one being a burger, which was very tasty...20403299 bread bowl was really good...If only I could have ate bread all day... we had a variety of salty bisques and muffin like breads. They were delicious. Service: Our initial server was VERY GOOD explaining to us 20403299 menu and Bobby Flay's cooking style... then suddenly they switched servers on us... he wasn't as good at answering some of our questions because many of my friends don't know who Bobby Flay is nor have they tried Southern style cuisine before. I'd love to go back to try other dishes. It's a great place for groups. We were lucky to get a booth that sat us quite comfortably. We also arrived at a non-peak hour for lunch, so we were luck y to be seated right away. Crispy Squid
