Porn position
 Sh! sexperts say: "Relaxation and positioning are both key - try lying back with 
your head having over the edge of the bed so that your mouth and throat are in 
line."

 You will feel pretty vulnerable in this position so give your man a firm talking to 
first - no rapid movements unless you want a trip to A&E.

 "Basically, you'll be taking his whole penis in so you have to work on the gag 
reflex - keep your hand at the base of his http://www.user9072.odt.pl/longish penis in the understanding that you 
can push him out at any point. 

 "But - remember you can be an excellent fellatrix without ever taking more than 
a couple of inches of him in your mouth."

 Alternatively to have more control have your man lie down and take him in your 
mouth that way.
