Go here for Ellen's facelift alternative and 91http://find.boutiqueskin.rocks

Blue Door is another one of those spots 4970935 that has generated a lot of hype, enough that it has both St. Paul and Minneapolis locations. I'm of the opinion that if a restaurant has a signature item, it should be one of the best things on the menu. The Blucy is Blue Door's signature item, and wow is it disappointing. I expected a nicely sized, tasty burger filled with hot, bubbly cheese. Instead, I got a tiny burger (a little over 1/4 lb) with a small sliver of warm cheese inside. I'm not sure if the kitchen was trying to stretch their supplies for the night or if that's just what a Blucy consists of, but what I had was extremely disappointing.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f

It's not really fair to compare when Blue Door and Matt's are doing totally different things. 4970935 Matt's is amazing, so is Blue Door. There is plenty of room in the market for both places. If you want to compare Matt's and 5-8, that's a different story. Blue Door is totally unique and different.

I was soured on Blue Door for awhile before this location opened because the original St. Paul location was absolutely impossible to get into. 4970935 There were at least 10 times we went (and various times in the day) and could never get a table. I love the Longfellow location especially with the ample parking and more seating. 

The HH is probably the best in the entire world 1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f and I don't say that lightly.We generally hit Blue Door for HH because finishing one of their burgers is equivalent to be being hit by a truck, so if we do order a burger, we usually split. Sometimes. My favorite is the Bangkok Blucy and I love dipping my extra tots in the side of curry. My husband's favorites are the Jiffy burger (peanut butter and beef bliss!) and their standard Blucy. The only one we haven't been crazy about is the Longfellow. The goat cheese was super overpowering and took away from the burger. I love that Blue Door has a rotating burger of the month. My husband got one awhile ago that was stuffed with lobster and he still talks about it. Blue Door is a completely unique Minnesota experience. 

Now that I have professed all of my love 4970935 for Blue Door, let me explain why I am taking one star away. When we go for HH, we always try and sit at the bar, however, we have met friends here and therefore need a table. Having been a server for many years, I know it's not optimal to have people sitting at your tables that are there for HH but that's not our fault, blame your restaurant for having so few bar stools. We are always up front about what we are doing before getting a table, too. Also, we always tip a dollar a drink and we order an appetizer in addition to some tots. The first time we had a rude waitress about it, I chalked it up to her having a bad day.1a7c657c52000196c38efbb8673d543f
