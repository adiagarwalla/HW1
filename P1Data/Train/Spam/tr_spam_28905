ess benefits have been a cornerstone of President Obama's and congressional Democrats' 
effort to spur a revival of the flaccid economy.The Senate bill, at 
a cost of $33 billion, would cut the payroll tax, extend jobless 
benefits and avoid cuts in Medicare payments to doctors through February. Both 
sides say they want to renew all three for a full year, 
but bargainers have so far failed to agree on how to pay 
for a package that size, which could cost roughly $200 billion.A conference 
committee is where the House and Senate can blend differences in their 
respective bills, but lawmakers can't go to conference unless they are appointed 
by their leaders.The House GOP leadership advised its rank and file on 
Sunday night to expect "significant" votes on Tuesday tied to the payroll 
tax.The biggest sticking point to House Republicans is the two month extension 
approved by the Senate compared to a year in their own bill. 
Attached in the Senate bill was a "sweetener" for
. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
s spectacular action sequences, "Ghost Protocol" may restore the hitmaker status of 
Cruise, whose audience became disenchanted with odd antics in the star's personal 
life five or six years ago."I would think any of that is 
way in the past," said Don Harris, head of distribution at Paramount, 
which took the unusual step of going early in huge-screen cinemas to 
build buzz for the general release."The plan was always to put the 
movie out into the best presentation theaters in North America," Harris said. 
"We hoped that people would recognize how good the movie was and 
how special it was being treated."Paramount's comic drama "Young Adult," starring Charlize 
Theron, had a weak expansion into wider release, finishing at No. 7 
with $3.7 million. The film had opened with big numbers a week 
earlier in a handful of theaters.At the beginning of 2011, Hollywood's summer 
and fall lineup looked so strong that studio executives were predicting the 
industry would break the d

fell slightly in early trading and Wall Street was set to open 
lower while South Korea's Kospi index dived nearly 5 percent but later 
recouped some losses to close 3.4 percent lower. Other Asian stock markets 
also fell.Australia's Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said Kim's death brings the situation 
to "one of those critical junctures" and "an exceptionally difficult period of 
transition.""It is critical that everybody exercises appropriate calm and restraint in what 
is a important development in terms of the overall stability of the 
region and the security of us all," Rudd said.The International Atomic Energy 
Agency had no immediate comment on how nuclear talks might proceed under

 WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P

album "Christmas" hits number one for a third week.Also making chart news 
is the late Amy Winehouse's "Lioness: Hidden Treasures." The compilation of unreleased 
tracks and alternate versions of previous hits makes and appearance at number 
5 on the Billboard 200.As Winehouse's album gives fans an opportunity to 
reflect on her life, Sublime with Rome fans are breathing a sigh 
of relief after the band's website nixed break-up rumors. While they may 
not be calling it quits any time soon they are taking a 
small break after the announcement that drummer Bud Gaugh is having a

a break from "diapers and baby bottles." They also added that they
