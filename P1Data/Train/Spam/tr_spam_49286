We ordered the prosciutto plate as an appetizer, 6593091 which had delicious bread and pickles/condiments on the side. The waitress was extremely accomodating and gave us gluten-free crackers instead of the bread, to accommodate my boyfriend. We are both wine and cheese noobs, so our waitress was extremely patient in explaining the different types of wine and asking us what we would prefer;  her recommendations were spot-on.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Small, mom-and-pop, CASH-ONLY, BYOB establishment that serves OUT OF THIS WORLD Cambodian food!  It is well-priced.  6593091 You leave full, satisfied and with leftovers as well!

They don't take reservations and I wouldn't recommend dining here for a large party.  I would stick to a party of 4 or less.  6593091 The service can be slow a lot of times, but the server is super helpful and the FOOD IS WORTH THE WAIT!  I recommend calling ahead before making the trip to S.Philly because sometimes, they may close for Cambodian holidays or for a catering job.  It's the worst to be excited for a meal to find out that the restaurant is closed that day!

MUST TRY STARTERS:  
GRILLED SEASONED MEATBALL STICKS:  c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f These are AMAZING!!  Unfortunately, they don't always have it because 1) there was high demand for it that day and they ran out or 2) it's the winter time and they can't grill these bad boys in the cold!  I usually call ahead to see if they have any that day or can put some aside for my visit!

PRAH-HOK KAHTEEH:  6593091 This is a caramelized ground pork with various spices.  It is served with seasonal vegetables that you use to dip in the minced pork.  The smell may be tough for diners who are new to Southeast Asian cuisine, but it's a tasty must-try!

MUST TRY FAMILY-STYLE DISHES:
SOUPS:  I really enjoy ALL of their soups/stews.  6593091 But my friends and boyfriend's favorite is the SAH-LAW MACHEU KAHTEEH with the PORK RIB TIP.  It is a slow-simmered sour soup prepared with coconut milk base, fresh pineapple, and fresh basil.  The coconut and lemon grass makes it very tasty and aromatic.  It has A LOT of pineapples and we wish they had less pineapples and maybe add potatoes or carrots to balance out the sweet pineapples and to absorb the tasty broth.  It is served with pork ribs and tips.  It would be even tastier if there were more pork ribs because the meat on the bones are much more tender!

CHA MUSSLES OR TALAPIA FILETS:  This dish is prepared and cooked in a special blend green curry mix and spice tossed with fresh basil.  WE LOVE THE CURRY and always ask for extra sauce, please!  Most diners order the mussels, but I prefer to order this dish with the fileted tilapia.  It really depends if I'm already ordering another fish dish or not.  If I order another fish dish, then I order this with the mussels.  If not, then I order this with the tilapia.c1786108792998fca2b59111a537fe0f
