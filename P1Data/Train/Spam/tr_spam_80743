		 Palace - 8 meals - and this was by far our favorite.  Food, service, ambiance were all excellent. We were seated as soon as we arrived, a little early, for our 7 PM reservation.  We were immediately greeted by water service, and our waiter offering me their Marguerita menu - oh my.  An enormous list of tequilas and several margueritas.  I was attracted to 22761608 peach and ordered that - it was SOOOO yummy!! We ordered 22761608 Shrimp & Corn Tamale appetizer.  It was very good.  22761608 shrimp were cooked perfectly and 22761608 dish was very tasty. Hubster ordered 22761608 Chili Relleno - and 22761608 moans from across 22761608 table told me that it was very, very good.  It was definitely not your traditional Chili Relleno.  22761608 exterior was crispy, there wasn't a tomato sauce over everything, but there were a couple of colorful sauces on 22761608 plate to run your bite through.  22761608 stuffing was eggplant and mechanga cheese - again not a traditional stuffing.  But it was reported to be very, very good. I wanted something light for dinner, so ordered 22761608 Chicken Skewers appetizer.  This came with little tortillas, so you could make little tacos if you wanted, and a peanut sauce.  22761608 chicken was nice and spicy, but not painfully so.  It was a small portion of 3 skewers, which was exactly what I wanted. I loved 22761608 ambiance.  It's a nice warm room, with warm southwest colors and a copper hood over 22761608 kitchen.  22761608 kitchen was behind glass, and you could see 22761608 chefs at work, which I love.  We had seen a show on 22761608 Food Channel about 22761608 development of this restaurant, so it was really fun to see it in person.  I would definitely eat here again, there were several things on 22761608 menu that I would like to try. SUMMARY: 22761608 food here was very tasty. Theirs is a modern, elegant take on Southwestern fare. There was a splash of sweet and a kick of spice in each dish. 22761608 meat was tender and 22761608 service was excellent. Our server, Joel, was attentive and informative.  He made a lovely meal all 22761608 more enjoyable. EXPECTATION OF 22761608 FAMOUS:  Emily Dickenson lamented, "How dreary - to be - Somebody!" I don't know how "dreary" fame is nowadays, but there are drawbacks.  Clearly Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill both suffers and benefits from his fame. My advice? Let go of whatever you think of Bobby Flay when you sit down to eat. Don't allow preconceived notions fed by reality television shows to color your expectation.  Many fabulous restaurants on 22761608 strip are owned/led by accomplished, talented, and (when we are lucky) creative chefs. At Mesa Grill (MG) 22761608 owner/executive chef also happens to be famous.  That fact should be 22761608 least important part of your experience with this place. TIGER SHRIMP: This delectable bite was my favorite of 22761608 night. 22761608 shrimp was cooked perfectly and like many dishes at Mesa Grill, comes with corn.  This appetizer was creamy and sweet. It was a gentle start to 22761608 meal. BLUE CORN PANCAKE:
