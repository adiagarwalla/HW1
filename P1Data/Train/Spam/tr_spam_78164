		 for drinks on 3030891 spot.   Hello tequila!   Yes, they have a great selection and 3030891 margaritas are just golden.   Mixed sweet and it's got 3030891 kick.   Our waiter introduced himself and informed us about 3030891 wine list. He even pointed out some of 3030891 specific details of 3030891 tequila list and explained some of 3030891 items on 3030891 menu. 3030891 bread basket was good, but I was mostly impressed with 3030891 customer service and 3030891 interior.   We skipped 3030891 appetizer and decided to go for 3030891 entree since we had to catch up with our scle for 3030891 club.   I opted for 3030891 Grilled Lamb Porterhouse Chops.   This is where BF's talent in his signature sauces come in.   Simple presentation, just grilled with a side of Tamale and 3030891 meat in 3030891 center.   3030891 flavors come together and heaven came down to earth.   It was a balance of meatiness, salt, sweet, spice, and a tang of goodness. It looked like I can finish 3030891 plate, but wow was I wrong.   That portion was a lot for one person to conquer.   Next time I'll try 3030891 seafood. I'll be back Mesa, I'll make sure to leave my hotel an hour before considering 3030891 strip traffic and 3030891 parking.   There are three places to valet park and 3030891 best one is all 3030891 way in 3030891 back closest to 3030891 restaurant. Food: If you like flavours, this place is for you! Almost everything on 3030891 menu has a bite to (except for 3030891 smoked salmon). Some dishes are spicy, some are not... It's really not all that spicy. I particularly liked 3030891 grits. It was sooo creamy. I don't want to know how many calories is in it, but then again, who can resist butter and cream? I ordered 3030891 lamb salad... I LOVE lamb. 3030891 spices rubbed on 3030891 lamb reminds me a lot of 3030891 spices from Northern China... Really yummy... 3030891 goat cheese sprinkled on 3030891 salad was a bit too powerful. 3030891 salad in itself was good. 3030891 greens were not swimming in dressing. Between my friends and I we ordered 5 different dishes... one being a burger, which was very tasty...3030891 bread bowl was really good...If only I could have ate bread all day... we had a variety of salty bisques and muffin like breads. They were delicious. Service: Our initial server was VERY GOOD explaining to us 3030891 menu and Bobby Flay's cooking style... then suddenly they switched servers on us... he wasn't as good at answering some of our questions because many of my friends don't know who Bobby Flay is nor have they tried Southern style cuisine before. I'd love to go back to try other dishes. It's a great place for groups. We were lucky to get a booth that sat us quite comfortably. We also arrived at a non-peak hour for lunch, so we were luck y to be seated right away. Crispy Squid
