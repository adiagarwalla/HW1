on previous test work and investment in a very lean, commercial way."Lockheed 
Martin will also provide support as a major subcontractor for the Liberty 
System, ATK officials announced today. This work includes designing various components for 
the spacecraft, such as avionics, propulsion systems, navigation and control, and the 
vehicle's docking system.The infrastructure we put in place that's already there to 
support testing and production is going to shorten the timeline," said Scott 
Norris, leader of the Liberty program at Lockheed Martin. "All three of 
our companies have worked together in the past, integrating things and working 
together. I think we're well poised to meet our scle, as aggressive 
as it is, with things we've already paid for in the past."The 
Liberty rocket and spacecraft have been submitted for consideration for the third 
and final round of funding under NASA's commercial crew program, Rominger said. 
The agency's selections are expected t
he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put 
on the no-fly list a person must be on the larger terro
o be announced in August. In the meantime, ATK is eager to 
continue development of the Liberty system."For us as a nation, we need 
commercial crew and heavy lift to maintain our leadership in space," Rominger 
said. "To me, it looks like this is a team that we, 
as a nation, should be very comfortable with. Let's do this so 
we can get U.S. astronauts launching from the U.S. by 2015."Sign up

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">nd John decided to separate, she was concerned that when she died, 
there would not be a man around that loved her," Palmieri said.Palmieri 
said she promised to be there for Edwards, but her dying friend 
continued to hold on to her feeling of loss.Edwards is accused of 
using campaign donors to pay for the cover-up of his affair with 
Hunter during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. 
He has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations 
and faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts.During Palmieri's testimony, Edwards buried his head 
in his hands. His daughter, Cate Upham, who who has attended most 
of the trial and was present during the morning's session, was not 
in the courtroom at the time.Palmieri, who now works for President Obma 
as deputy communications director, was asked by defense lawyers about a 2007 
confrontation at an Iowa Hotel in which Elizabeth Edward
  accusing Arpaio's office of racially profiling Latinos, basing immigration enforcement on 
racially charged citizen complaints and punishing Hispanic jail inmates for speaking Spanish 
in Arizona's most populous county.The DOJ also accused Arpaio of having a 
culture of disregard for basic constitutional rights.The civil rights allegations have led 
some Arpaio critics to call for his resignation, including the National Council 
of La Raza, a prominent advocacy group for Latinos.The sheriff's office also 
is facing criticism over more than 400 sex-crimes investigations -- including dozens 
of alleged child molestations -- that hadn't been investigated adequately or weren't 
examined at all over a three-year period ending in 2007.Arpaio has apologized 
for the botched cases, reopened 432 sex-crimes investigations and made 19 arrests.Separate 
from the civil rights probe, a federal grand jury has been investigating 
Arpaio's office on criminal abuse-of-power allegations sinc
 Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going 
to create more suffering
