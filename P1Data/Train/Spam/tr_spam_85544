 restaurant is small and is immediately adjacent to the casino's sports book & club Pure. bread basket was interesting- hubby liked the corn bread & raisin bread, I liked the jalapeno brea husband had veal chop - nice size, tender; came with a corn tamale; tamales area common side here & a corn, separate side order; I didn't like the a la carte pricing for sides; his chop was $48, and he can't get a real side with it? this isn't a fancy steak house where you expect everything to be a la carte, but OK! I had chile honey salmon; it was tasty, but kind of a small portion; tasty sauces but not enough of them; I had twice baked horseradish potato, sounded bomb, would have been bomb, but it was too salty; there are not a lot of veggie options here, not a lot of green anything, but lots of corn. Reserved via Open Table for dinner with my husband while in Vegas for the weekend for our wedding anniversary. It was Friday
