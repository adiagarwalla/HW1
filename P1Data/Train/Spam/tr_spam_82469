Dear Mrs. Moodie,<br>
<br>
Some cruise lines offer additional discounts for Vacations To Go
customers who are <b>55 or older</b>, <b>airline employees</b> and
cruise <b>past passengers</b>.<br>
<br>
Vacations To Go offers a feature, unique in the cruise industry, that
allows us to show you every special discount for which you are eligible,
whenever you browse our site. These special rates don't apply to every
sailing, but when they are in effect, they are the lowest available.<br>
<br>
If you have not recently updated your Vacations To Go Account to make
sure you see the biggest discounts for which you are eligible, please
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emaillink.cfm?lnk=profile&email=robert.moodie@fs.net&nr=cus_F9b_pf">click here</a>
to do so now. It will take only a moment.<br>
<br><hr><br>
This week, we've arranged the following <b>money-saving offers with
Disney, Silversea, Azamara and MSC</b>. The offers
include shipboard credits, which are as good as cash on the ship and can
be used toward onboard purchases not covered in your cruise fare, such
as shore excursions and spa treatments.<br>
<br>
Vacations To Go is offering customers shipboard credits of up to $100
per stateroom on select <b>Disney Cruise Line</b> sailings. The whole
family will enjoy Disney-themed musicals and fireworks under the stars
-- and, adults can escape to venues just for them while kids play in
immersive clubs. If you've not started planning your 2015 vacation,
now's the time with 50made by February 15</b> --

for offer details.<br>
<br>
<b>Silversea</b> is offering our customers free WiFi plus a selection of
free shore excursions in each port on 2015 European cruises.

for dates and prices.<br>
<br>
<b>Azamara </b>is offering Vacations To Go customers exclusive shipboard
credits of up to $1,500 per cabin on a variety of sailings, as well as
markdowns of up to 70<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emailtick.cfm?r=0&ns=vtg,mm,F9b,aza&nr=cus_F9b_int">Click here</a>

<br>
<b>MSC</b>  is offering our customers savings of up to 77ages 11 and under sail free. In addition, receive an onboard credit of
up to $200 per cabin on a variety of sailings, plus a free all-inclusive
drinks package when you book select suite accommodations.
<b>Book by February 15.</b>

<br>
As always, these offers are for new bookings only and subject to
availability. Restrictions may apply.<br>
<br><hr><br>
If you're thinking of taking a cruise and traveling solo, you probably
already know that cruise lines charge an extra fee for an individual
booking a cabin intended for two. Typically, the cruise line starts with
the per-person rate based on double occupancy and adds 50the price for a single traveler -- the dreaded single supplement.<br>
<br>
The good news? Vacations To Go has found or negotiated low or no single
supplements on hundreds of prime cruise departures. These great solo
deals are updated daily and listed on our site.

to see our <b>Singles Discounts</b> ticker now.<br>
<br><hr><br>
Cruise lines have been working for years to accommodate passengers with
disabilities, and 115 of the world's best cruise ships are now
accessible to some extent.<br>
<br>
Eight years ago, Vacations To Go filled a void in the travel industry
with the creation of a department dedicated to assisting travelers with
disabilities. We developed the first comprehensive, ship-by-ship guide
to facilities, services and amenities for travelers with special needs,
with search tools that not only reveal the ships that meet these needs
but return great bargains as well.<br>
<br>
There are ships with TTY phones and vibrating alarm clocks for guests
who are hard of hearing or deaf; menus and daily activity lists in large
print for people who have low vision; roll-in showers, push-button doors
and pool access for travelers who use wheelchairs or scooters; and many
other features to make cruising accessible. There are services that will
deliver oxygen tanks or wheelchairs or scooters to a ship on the day of
departure, and retrieve them at the end of a cruise.<br>
<br>
For more information,
<a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/emaillink.cfm?lnk=spneeds&nr=cus_F9b_int">click here</a>
to visit the section of our site devoted to travelers with special
needs.<br>
<br>
Our Special Needs department is open Monday-Friday from 7 a.m. to 7
p.m., and Saturday and Sunday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Central Standard
Time. Be sure to tell your cruise counselor about all your special needs
prior to booking so that he or she can determine if they can be met.<br>
