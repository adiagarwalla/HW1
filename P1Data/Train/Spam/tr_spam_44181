There's literally less than 10 items on this menu 1312474 and they are just some combo of cuts of chicken. 

Gotta respect their menu choice cuz when you do something that well, you don't need much else on the menu. 

As other yelpers have commented, 1312474 the sides aren't much to write home about--I especially did not care for the potato salad because it's on the sweeter side. All other sides were fine our not memorable. The star is undoubtedly the chicken. I ordered the thigh and drumstick and it was pretty incredible. Chicken was freshly fried, moist, and surprisingly spicy. 

This is an interesting location (there are multiple)  as it attracts a range of clientele -- Everyone from young families to the most hipster of hipsters (yeah I see your overly waxed mustache, my friend).  Your food and drink are served on Styrofoam... Easy cleanup I guess. lol.75cf51504d900f8e7eb879a6712e8a43
