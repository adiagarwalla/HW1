. The process has since stalled, though diplomats are working to restart 
negotiations.Following the famine, the number of North Koreans fleeing the country rose 
dramatically, with many telling tales of hunger, political persecution and rights abuses 
that North Korean officials emphatically denied.Kim often blamed the U.S. for his 
country's troubles and his regime routinely derides Washington-allied South Korea as a 
puppet of the Western superpower.Former U.S. President George W. Bush described Kim 
as a tyrant. "Look, Kim Jong Il is a dangerous person. He's 
a man who starves his people. He's got huge concentration camps. And 
... there is concern about his capacity to deliver a nuclear weapon," 
Bush said in 2005.Defectors from North Korea describe Kim as an eloquent 
and tireless orator, primarily to the military units that form the base 
of his support.He also made numerous trips to factories and other sites 
to offer what North Korea calls "field guidance." As rece
APFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.TEL AVIV  An Israeli entrepreneur has legally changed 
his name to Mark Zuckerberg in an attempt to avoid being sued 
by Facebook.According to tech blog ZDNet.com, last week's odd maneuver came after 
Facebook threatened Rotem Guez with a lawsuit over allegations that his company 
violated the social networking giant's terms of service."If you want to sue 
me, you're going to have to sue Mark Zuckerberg," said Guez, who 
is betting that Facebook won't want to attract publicity from suing somebody 
with the same name of the company's founder.The lawsuit came after Guez 
launched an online company that sells advertisers "Likes" for their Facebook pages.Guez's 
Like Store promises companies increased traffic to their Facebook pages by offering 
Facebook users free content from the companies' sites, which is a violation 
of Facebook's terms of service.Facebook served Guez with a lawsuit earlier this 
year threatening to shut it down. Guez has

filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating 
the system.As the nation heads into the

on Russian state television that the platform's portholes were smashed in a 
second and the crew had struggled to fix them."Everyone rushed to the 
deck," he told the First Channel station. "It all felt like a 
movie."An official at the rig's owner Arktikmorneftegazrazvedka, who asked not to be 
named because the offshore oil exploration firm is not authorized to comment 
on the rescue operation, told The Associated Press that rescue vessels have 
spotted four rafts with people aboard, but it was not clear if 
they were alive or not.The Emergencies Ministry and military officials would not 
confirm that rafts were found, but said there are four vessels, one 
helicopter and one airplane still searching for survivors. Helicopter shots from the

as "general," after having previously only used his official title -- vice-chairman 
of the central military commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, AFP 
reported."The latest move indicates Kim Jong Un is being put forward formally 
as a powerful leader like his father," Sejong Institute analyst Cheong Seong-Chang, 
a specialist in the succession issue, said in October."Such a title has 
been used internally, but North Korea now appears to be boosting the 
image of Jong Un as military leader," he said.Little is known about 
the succession. South Korea's top official on cross-border affairs said last month 
that there would be challenges in transferring power to the son.Kim Jong

loses, the growing stack of lawsuits may be helping draw the line 
between a writer or director who draws inspiration from someone elses story 
or real-life events, and one who unlawfully plagiarizes it.According to U.S. copyright 
law, ideas are free for anyone to use. Only specific expressions of 
those ideas are protected. So anyone can make a movie about a 
boy wizard who goes to school for wizards, but the law prevents 
someone from copying the specific expression in the Harry Potter books, like 
the plot twists, the traits of the characters, the names and dialog. 
The line is grey sometimes, explained Matt Belloni, news director at The 
Hollywood Reporter. Hollywood is very sensitive about stealing ideas because of the 
long history of lawsuits. But the publicity surrounding the lawsuits does
