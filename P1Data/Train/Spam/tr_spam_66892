ReutersBrad Pitt and Angelina Jolie at the premiere of 'In the Land 
of Blood and Honey.'Angelina Jolie is proud of her gut-wrenching directorial debut 
In The Land of Blood and Honey, a drama centered on a 
young woman who falls in love with her captor during the Bosnian 
War. But bringing to life such a controversial story has taken its 
toll on the Oscar winner.I felt very grateful that I had the 
chance to have this movie made, but we all made it together 
and influenced each other. It was only a week ago that I 
sat down alone before we started to show it I have been 
so terribly worried in the months before the film just to get 
it right because it means so much, it is so sensitive and 
is so important, Jolie told FOX411s Pop Tarts column. The cast isnt 
just a group of actors, they lived through this  this is 
their history. The burden of that has been really hard, so I 
am genuinely relieved to be all here together and getting it right.Jolie 
made the film to cha
've earned the right to try to determine their future. They've earned 
the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But 
the continuing violence in Libya, including recent skirmishes between revolutionary fighters and 
national army troops near Tripoli's airport,
 transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">IRWINDALE, Calif.  Police said three are dead, including the suspected shooter, 
in California office attack.A gunman stormed into an office of the Southern 
California Edison utility Friday and shot a man and woman before killing 
himself, police said.The building was quickly locked down and dozens of people 
were seen streaming out with their hands raised. Two nearby schools also 
were locked down but no one on the campuses was hurt."One male 
gunman shot one female, one male and then apparently took his own 
life," Police Chief Dennis Smith told reporters.The conditions of the two people 
he wounded were not immediately known. There was also no immediate word 
on what prompted the gunfire.The utility company office is in a complex 
of buildings that also includes a business called California Lighting Sales.Cindy Gutierrez, 
the controller for that business, said employees there didn't hear any shots 
fired and didn't realize anything was amiss until building management a
 hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving 
heart for people. He was 
APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They
