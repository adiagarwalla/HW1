 arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w
 start their vacation today, but the American people are tired of 
seeing Congress do the bare minimum and then punt," added a Boehner 
spokesman.Speaking to that very claim, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer said 
the president does find it "inexcusable to do anything less than extend 
this tax cut for the entire year, and Congress must work on 
a one year deal." But he said, a two-month extension will do 
for now to avoid hitting the Jan. 1 deadline.Boehner "himself just yesterday 
called it a 'good deal' and a 'victory,'" Pfeiffer added "It's time 
House Republicans stop playing politics and get the job done for the 
American people."House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi accused Boehner of folding to the 
Tea Party wing of the GOP whose "extremism and opposition to the 
middle class" demands a tax increase."The only thing standing in the way 
of a middle class tax cut is Tea Party Republicans in the 
House with their latest made-up crisis just days before Ch

booted from the school last year  after the teacher dared to 
give the overhyped Hollywood hunk a D for blowing off class, a 
lawsuit charges.Jos Angel Santana said he slapped the 127 Hours star with 
the bad grade because he missed 12 of his 14 Directing the 
Actor II classes while pursuing a masters in fine arts.Santana said he 
then suffered all kinds of drama  first from Franco, who publicly 
ridiculed him, then from his department, which axed him over the D.Follow 
FOX411 on Twitter.The school has bent over backwards to create a Franco-friendly 
environment, thats for sure, Santana, 58, told The Post. The university has 
done everything in its power to curry favor with James Franco.Santana, who 
is suing NYU in Manhattan Supreme Court for his job back, asserts

clue in his other courses, too, blowing off just as many classes. 
But the stars other professors at NYUs Tisch School of the Arts 
still gave him good grades, Santana said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.Big names such 
as Francos typically translate into big bucks for universities.After his student gig, 
Franco, 33, wound up teaching an NYU course this past fall on 
adapting poetry into short films.Santana suggested that the good grades Franco received 
were payback to the actor for hiring one of his other professors, 
Jay Anania.Franco hired Anania to write and direct the film William Vincent, 
which starred Franco, the suit states. The film was featured at the 
2010 Tribeca Film Festival.Click here to read the full report from the

 APJuly 13, 2008: Shown here is the Freddie Mac headquarters in McLean, 
VaHomebuyers, beware.In exchange for a two-month tax cut, the Senate on Saturday 
approved a permanent increase in fees attached to mortgages backed by Fannie 
Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).The fee hike would 
apply to new mortgages and new refinances, and would last for the 
life of the loans.The increase is meant to pay for the roughly 
$33 billion package the Senate approved Saturday to extend a 2 percentage 
point payroll tax cut for another two months. The Obama administration says 
160 million people benefit from that tax cut.But the mortgage fee provision 
would have widespread long-term impact, considering nine out of 10 mortgages go 
through one of the three government-sponsored finance organizations affected.The new fee increase 
would amount to about $15 a month more for a $200,000 mortgage, 
according to a senior Democratic official. That's $180 a year, or $36

there is only one commander in chief. And Obama, who came to 
office with a thin resume on foreign affairs, has been getting on-the-job 
training in the subject for three years.And polls do show Obama outperforming 
his job approval numbers when it comes to foreign affairs, especially on 
terrorism. In the latest FOX News poll, Obama carded a weak 44 
percent overall job approval rating and a dire 35 percent on his 
handling of the economy. But Obama got 50 percent for his handling 
of Iraq and 47 percent on handling of Afghanistan.And what weaknesses Obama 
has shown on foreign policy have been within the Democratic base with 
voters unhappy about Obamas extension of several key points of Bush administration 
policy and the escalation of the Afghan war. Those dont sound like 
potential GOP voters, though they could punish Obama by sitting on the 
sidelines.The Republican contenders, meanwhile, dont offer
