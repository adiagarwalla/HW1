http://availnow.muskincreasevitality.click
Trail ends 1/4/15

Went here on a Wed night and there's still a line to order the food 8220696 around 8 pm. When you get in, you need to order at the counter before you get seated and they will give you a number. We sat at the bar and ordered the Carne Asada Tots and 2 burgers (Black Sheep and Royale with Cheese). 8220696 We started off with the Oragina. Really good drink but hard to open. Not too sweet as well.  We got the tots and it was really good. The was moist and cheesy. The carna asada was a bit dry but the tots delivered all the taste.5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Downtown LA is a melting pot of people, 8220696 food and cultures and it's beginning to establish itself as a little brother to New York. (Am I reaching to far?) I lived in DTLA for three years and loved every minute of it, but the price of living is a pretty penny and I had to get out; but there are many things that draw me back time and time again. Fooooodddd!!! :) 

Since leaving DTLA so many spots have popped up 8220696 that I must experience and Black sheep was one of them. It's located on 6th and main almost hidden as the actual restaurant sits below the sidewalk so don't miss it. Once inside it was pretty dark, the low lighting mixed with the dark colors gave this spot a very atmospheric feel.

My girlfriend and I proceeded up to the order counter/ bar 5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013 and glanced up at the menu. We decided on the Thai chicken sandwich, the Smokey western burger And the Carne asada tots. We took a seat in one of the booths and waited.

What's immediately noticeable is the poor girl 8220696 who takes the orders also cleans and waits the tables and is the bartender. So I knew we might have to wait for a bit as she's the only one there other than the cook.

Not to much of a wait and our food was brought to our table. It was pretty difficult to take pics without flash due to the low light 8220696 and I had to turn on my flashlight just to see what everything looked like, but everything looked good to me.

The carne asada tots are definitely the star here. 5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013 The tots are crispy almost crunchy, topped with cheese a sauce and the  seasoned carne asada was a perfect addition. My western burger was decent, nothing to impressive. I got it medium rare which allowed the meat to stay moist while having a nice crust on the outside, but it needed a lot more seasoning, like they didn't season the meat at all. Bummer.

The Bread holding the burger together 8220696 is a gourmet house bread which is very good but to soft to really hold the burger together; the insides of my burger constantly slipped out. I hate that!! My girlfriends Thai chicken sandwich was much better than my burger, a whole fried chicken breast topped with cabbage and a spicy Thai sauce all made this a much better "sandwich" than my burger.
The low lighting and dark interior colors reminded me of another spot in DTLA, Syrup. Come to find out It's the same owner. Overall I was impressed with Black sheep, it's a small gastropub doing very good food. Get the tots, skip the burger and get the chicken sandwich!5d0d22d7e0157f691b74efd576b3c013
