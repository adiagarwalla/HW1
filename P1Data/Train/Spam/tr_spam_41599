<p style="font-size:xx-small;">GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
 rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f
 al food aid to North Korea since Lee took office in 2008, 
saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.
