 The Browns practice as part of their religious beliefs.Oral arguments in 
the case are set for Friday in Salt Lake City's U.S. District 
Court.It's not clear when Waddoups will rule.State prosecutors contend the Browns -- 
who haven't been charged -- aren't facing any real harm because the 
state has rarely prosecuted individuals for bigamy without also prosecuting for other 
crimes, such as underage marriages, sexual abuse or welfare fraud."They have not 
been warned that if they do not cease to engage in their 
polygamous relationships that legal actions will be taken against them," Assistant Utah 
Attorney General Jerrold S. Jensen has said in court papers asking the 
judge to dismiss the case."And -- what is probably the tipping point 
-- there have been no arrests or prosecutions for the mere practice 
of polygamy in Utah in over 50 years."A check of state court 
records by The Associated Press found at least two cases, however.Bob Foster 
had three wives when he was
with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico applied for the chance 
to win between about $50 million to $100 million apiece in prize 
money. The winnings are to help build statewide systems that affect all 
early learning programs, including child care, Head Start centers and public or 
private preschools.Billions are spent annually in America on earlycation programs, but 
the quality and availability of those programs varies greatly. Roughly half of 
all 3-year-olds and about a quarter of 4-year-olds do not attend preschool, 
said Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research 
at Rutgers University.Kids who attend quality earlycation programs have been shown 
to do better in school, be less likely to spend time in 
prison later and to make more money as adults. But children from 
low-income families who start kindergarten without any schooling are estimated to start 
school 18 months behind their peers, a gap that is extremely dif
nnounced over the intercom that everyone should stay indoors."At that point we 
knew something was wrong, then 5 to 10 minutes later that's when 
we hear the police," she said, adding that she and her 20 
colleagues have been locked in their office ever since."I'm fine, kind of 
nervous," she said.The complex has two buildings and her company's office is 
on the western end. The Edison building is on the eastern end.She 
called the campus "pretty safe," with a guard and amenities that include 
a cafe and gym.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> arrested and charged with bigamy in 1974. He pleaded no contest 
and was sentenced to six months in Jail. He was released after 
21 days and ordered to serve five years of probation. A judge 
also said Foster was not allowed to live with his families. Foster 
died from cancer in 2008. He was still married to all three 
women.Mark Easterday was arrested and charged with bigamy in 1999. Authorities were 
alerted to Easterday's multiple marriage by his first wife as part of 
a custody battle during their divorce. He ultimately pleaded no contest to 
adultery because the divorce was finalized before the bigamy case went to 
trial. Easterday was sentenced to probation.Easterday, who left Utah and is currently 
married to two women, told The Associated Press he believes the Browns 
are right to fear a bigamy prosecution."I know from experience that they 
do prosecute," Easterday said. I think they should change the law over 
the entire country. Why it is that in some places a w
 said he has never described what he saw as anal rape or 
anal intercourse and couldn't see Sandusky's genitals, but that "it was very 
clear that it looked like there was intercourse going on."In its report 
last month, the grand jury summarized McQueary's testimony as saying he "saw 
a naked boy ... with his hands up against the wall, being 
subjected to anal intercourse by a naked Sandusky."Under cross examination by an 
attorney for Curley, McQueary reiterated that he had not seen Sandusky penetrating 
or fondling the boy but was nearly certain they were having intercourse 
because the two were standing so close and Sandusky's arms were wrapped 
around the youth.He said he peeked into the shower three times -- 
the first via a mirror, the other two times directly. The last 
time he looked in, Sandusky and the boy had separated, he said. 
He said he didn't say anything, but "I know they saw me. 
They looked directly in my eye, both of them."McQueary said the entire 
enc
 his home, on Penn State property and elsewhere. The scandal has 
provoked strong criticism that Penn State officials didn't do enough to stop 
Sandusky, and prompted the departures of Paterno and the school's longtime president, 
Graham Spanier.Curley, 57, Penn State's athletic director, was placed on leave by 
the university after his arrest. Schultz, 62, returned to retirement after spending 
about four decades at the school, most recently as senior vice president 
for business and finance, and treasurer.Nov. 5, 2011: In this photo provided

coordinator Gerald "Jerry" Sandusky, is escorted in handcuffs to a waiting police 
car in Bellefonte, Pa.
