nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
igration enforcement. Maltreatment of Spanish-speakers in the jails also violated the constitution, 
federal officials alleged.The fallout from the report was swift as Homeland Security 
officials announced the department is severing ties with Arpaio."They don't need to 
do this," Montgomery said at a news conference. "This effort at leverage 
is placing Arizona citizens at risk."Napolitano issued a statement Thursday saying federal 
resources would be used to identify those "who meet U.S. Immigration and 
Customs Enforcement's (ICE) immigration enforcement priorities."Department officials also are restricting Arpaio's office 
from using a program that uses fingerprints collected in local jails to 
identify illegal immigrants.Deputies will still send fingerprints of those being booked to 
the FBI, which will relay them to immigration agents.Obama administration officials disputed 
Montgomery's assertions, pointing out that they will be pushing to put immigration 
officers ba
 focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> hope it's sufficient for the way our whole island suffered."Harris-Moore's final 
spree came after he stole a pistol in eastern British Columbia and 
took a plane from a hangar in Idaho, where investigators found bare 
footprints on the floor and wall. That plane crashed near Granite Falls, 
Washington, after it ran out of fuel.He made his way to Oregon 
in a 32-foot (9.75-meter) boat stolen in southwestern Washington -- stopping first 
to leave $100 at an animal shelter in Raymond, Washington. From Oregon, 
authorities said, Harris-Moore traveled across the United States, frequently stealing cars from 
the parking lots of small airports. In Indiana, he stole another plane 
and made for the Bahamas, more than 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) away, 
where authorities finally caught him in a manhunt that spanned multiple islands.
 ong independents. Obama receives 45 percent of non-aligned adults compared with 41 
percent for Romney. Against Gingrich, Obama holds a wide lead among independents, 
with 54 percent supporting the president and 31 percent backing the former 
Georgia congressman.Another piece of good news for Obama: people generally like him 
personally. Obama's personal favorability rating held steady at 53 percent, with 46 
percent viewing him unfavorably. About three-quarters called him likable.The economy remains a 
source of pessimism, though the poll suggests the first positive movement in 
public opinion on the economy in months. One in five said the 
economy improved in the last month, double the share saying so in 
October. Still most expect it to stay the same or get worse.The 
Associated Press-GfK Poll was conducted December 8-12 2011 by GfK Roper Public 
Affairs and Corporate Communications. It involved landline and cellphone interviews with 1,000 
adults nationwide and has a ma
lier this month, High Court judges John Thomas and Duncan Ouseley said 
Assange could apply to the Supreme Court to argue that point and 
seek to prove that Europe's process of carrying out extradition was flawed.However, 
Thomas warned Assange that his chance of success "may be extraordinarily slim."Assange 
-- who leads the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy website -- was accused of rape, 
coercion and molestation following encounters with two Swedish women in August 2010. 
Swedish authorities issued a European Arrest Warrant on rape and molestation accusations, 
and Assange was arrested in London in December 2010.The 40-year-old denies wrongdoing 
and is currently held on bail on the condition that he lives 
under curfew at a supporter's country estate in eastern England and wears 
an electronic tag.Claes Borgstrom, the lawyer in Sweden representing the two women, 
said the decision would cause more strain for his clients -- and 
predicted Assange would eventually face extradition.
