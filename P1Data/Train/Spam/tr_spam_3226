be blown out of proportion.You have to put these numbers in perspective. 
Mariah lost 30 pounds. That number looks huge, but she had twins, 
says celebrity nutritionist Heather Bauer, author of Bread is the Devil and 
the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some 
we talked to, Bauer doesnt doubt that celebrity endorsers actually use the 
products they promote, but she doesnt believe its all theyre using, either.Friend

APFaeirouz Elbergwa was among an elite group of Libyans selected by the 
family of former dictator Muammar Qaddafi to come to the U.S. for 
a two-year diplomatic training program.EAST LANSING, Mich.  More than two years
