tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
hallenge to the authoritarian government. On a near-daily basis, thousands of villagers 
gather for rallies, shouting slogans for the return of their land and 
pumping their fists in the air.The gathering took on a more somber 
note Friday as about 7,000 people attended a memorial ceremony for local 
butcher Xue Jinbo, who before his death had been one of the 
village's representatives in tense negotiations with officials over the land seizure.Banners saying 
"You sacrificed your life for our land" and "Sadly mourn Xue Jinbo" 
were displayed at the ceremony, said villager Qin Zhuan, who was reached 
by phone.Qin said they made speeches and lined up to bow in 
front of a large photograph of Xue, who died Sunday, not long 
after he was detained by police on suspicion of participating in riots 
in September.Expressing commonly held suspicions over Xue's death, another villager said he 
appeared to have been abused in custody."He is man with a loving 
heart for people. He was 
010, after stolen planes were found at the airport there. The second 
time, Harris-Moore left Ater's new security system in a utility sink, under 
a running faucet. He took cash and a tray of croissants, and 
Ater's insurance company jacked up his rates.Mike Parnell, a former owner of 
the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We 
purchased night vision goggles. I'm glad that day is finally approaching when 
we will finally know what the consequences are, and I

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APDecember 12, 2011: English actor Christian Bale speaks to journalists during an 
interview on the red carpet as he arrives for an event of 
the Zhang Yimou-directed new movie "The Flowers of War" in Beijing, China. 
BEIJING  "Batman" star Christian Bale, in the midst of promoting a 
film he made in China that some critics have called propaganda, was 
stopped trying to visit a blind activist living under house arrest -- 
with a CNN crew in tow.CNN posted footage of a scuffle between 
Bale and the activist's guards on its website Friday.The run-in and publicity 
is likely to cause discomfort in China's government-backed film industry, which hopes 
Bale's movie "The Flowers of War" will be a creative success at 
home and abroad. It also raises questions about whether it was prudent 
to bring the star to see an activist guarded by thugs who 
have turned away dozens of reporters and fellow activists trying to see 
him in the past.Bale was due to leave China on Friday and

said.Angie Torres, a stay-at-home mother of four children under the age of 
8, was in the Indianapolis Kmart on Tuesday to make a payment 
on her layaway bill when she learned the woman next to her

said Torres, who doubted she would have been able to pay off 
the balance. "I was in disbelief. I hugged her and gave her
