<font color="white" size="1">WASHINGTON  Former U.S. Ambassador Jon Huntsman is defending his refusal to 
compete in the leadoff Iowa Republican precinct caucuses, focusing instead on New 
Hampshire.Huntsman tells CBS's "The Early Show" the formula, so far as he 
is concerned, is quite elementary. Says Huntsman: "They pick corn in Iowa. 
They pick presidents in New Hampshire."The former Utah governor has made little 
effort to win in Iowa, focusing mostly on New Hampshire in the 
early going. He has remained in the lower tier of candidates as 
others, including Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum -- and at one time, 
Herman Cain -- soared in the polls. He was ambassador to China 
for President Obama, but says that shouldn't be used against him as 
he seeks the Republican presidential nomination.

<font color="white" size="1">and ordinary Pennsylvanians -- Democrats remain competitive in Republican-held seats from Bucks 
County to Butler County," the memo said. "This map ensures competitive races 
across the state for the next decade."But Republicans say the redistricting process 
as a whole is taking once-competitive seats off the table in November."The 
trend you're seeing of Republican seats being strengthened in the redistricting process 
is shrinking the playing field for House Democrats," said Paul Lindsay, spokesman 
with the National Republican Congressional Committee.
