		 customer service manager I have expectations on what customer service should be, and would think Bobby would feel the same. On a scale of 1-5 the Customer service rating = 2  however the quality of food = 5. Normally I would chalk up the service as the waiter was just having a bad day, but being that the girls at the hostess stand were no better its hard to think it was just a bad day for everyone working that day. I am not sure I would return to this one of his establishments but would for sure try another one. I had try Bobby Flay's restaurant and it lived up to my expectations.  It was packed so being that I was traveling for work, alone and had no reservations; so I ate at the bar.  I ordered the pork tenderloin, which is their signature dish.  It was delicious and the perfect amount of food.  It with a small sweet potato tamale.  It was cooked perfect with the perfect amount of spice.  I got a couple different glasses of wine - 1 Mesa Grill Cuvee Cabernet and a Spanish wine.  The bartender was awesome and so helpful.  She let me taste quite a few of the wines.  OH and I also started the dinner with a White Peach Margarita......YUMMY.  The bring out a small bread basket at the beginning of the meal as well which includes a delicious sweet corn bread muffin and jalapeno asiago bread.  
The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was I was surprised at the lack of wine by the glass choices and also a little surprised there were no salad entrees (menu is fairly small). They have a lot of different tequillas though and honestly I was glad there were no more menu options as it was hard enough to decide. I highly recommend!  Delicious food with great friendly staff. Birthday weekend for an adorable Indonesian girl started here.  Was actually looking forward to this dinner the whole week.  No doubt the food will be full of southwestern flavor.  Dinner started with a bottle of Chimay blue and some duck pancakes.  The pancakes were succulent to say the least.  Very flavorful like tender BBQ pork chunks wrapped in a small thin pancake.  Not sure what it's made of but I'm sure it had blue corn in it.  It is Bobby Flay we're talking about. The main dish was rib eye steak.  I ordered medium rare but the waitress suggested medium due to the rarity near the bone.  Seems some people don't like it that rare.    Turns out the inside near the bone was pretty good.  Tender and a small amount of pink.  The only issue was the ends of the rib eye was burnt and cooked all the way through.  Oh well next time I stick with what I know.   The steak was generally minimalist which I like.  Not too much sauce just salt and pepper.  The steak was quite large, enough to share a small piece with 4 others. The favors were returned and I got to taste the pork tenderloin.  Now that is a great dish.  Three tender cylinders about one and a half inches in diameter and two inches tall.  How
