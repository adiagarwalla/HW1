largest unauthorized outpost, set for next month would not be affected by 
the formation of the new committee, officials said.But the panel's makeup aroused 
suspicions it would legalize at least some of the more than 100 
outposts built without government authorization, including dozens Sasson says were erected on 
privately held Palestinian land.The committee's head, former Supreme Court chief justice Edmond 
Levy, spoke out against Israel's withdrawal of settlers from the Gaza Strip 
in 2005. A second panel member, Alan Baker, has represented settlers hoping 
to legalize unauthorized outposts.The international community opposes all Jewish settlement activity in 
the West Bank and east Jerusalem, areas captured by Israel in the 
1967 Mideast war. But Israel distinguishes between the 121 settlements established in 
accordance with official prores and the more than 100 unauthorized "outposts" that 
skirted the process with the help of sympathetic authorities and are con
creasingly unpopular war in Afghanistan, and add more complications to the already 
difficult mission of U.S. forces.The figures do not include an incident Wednesday 
in which an Afghan soldier shot and killed a NATO service member 
in southern Afghanistan. International forces and the Afghan army disagreed on exactly 
what happened in the killing. A spokesman for the international military force 
said Afghan soldiers detained the gunman after he attacked NATO troops Tuesday 
night. Afghan National Army commander Sayed Malluk confirmed the shooting, but said 
the Afghan soldier told investigators it was an accident.The U.S. defense officials' 
testimony, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of Wednesday's hearing, lays 
out the screening process for Afghan nationals who are brought in to 
provide security for U.S. forces. And it includes improvements in the program 
made after an attack at Forward Operating Base Frontenac in March 2011 
that killed two U.S. soldiers
PARACHINAR, Pakistan  Government officials say Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant positions 
in two different areas along the Afghan border, killing 31 suspected insurgents.Political 
administrators Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul say the strikes occurred Wednesday morning 
in the Orakzai and Kurram tribal areas.It was not possible to independently 
confirm the information because the areas are effectively off-limits to reporters.The strikes 
followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram 
that killed over 60 people in the last week.The Pakistani military has 
launched a series of offensives against militants in the country's semiautonomous tribal 
region in the past few years.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">to be an active homosexual    a zero-tolerance policy experts 
called relatively rare.He was not averse to new methods of outreach. Heeding 
the pope's call for a "New Evangelization," Bevilacqua used then-novel methods, such 
a toll-free confession line, a live weekly radio call-in program and an 
online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We are carrying out 
the wishes of the Holy Father for a new evangelization, reaching out 
to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a telephone hotline began 
in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass and Catholic school 
enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, leading him to 
close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The five-county archdiocese just 
this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, 
as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John Paul II when 
he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did not accept it 
at
 nizant of this."
A Different Romney, A Different Florida Than Last Time"[John McCains plan to 
combat global warming] would cost America 300,000 jobs. In addition, people would 
pay, they estimate, approximately 50 cents per gallon more for gasoline and 
20 percent more for their gas utility bill. That would depress the 
economy just at a time when we're trying to stimulate the economy."-- 
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney campaigning in Sweetwater, Fla. on Jan. 27, 
2008.Florida is a very different place than it was when the Republican 
primary race came to the state four years ago.In 2008 exit polls, 
44 percent of Florida Republican primary voters who described themselves as very 
conservative, picked second-place finisher Mitt Romney -- more than double the share 
of that group that went to either overall winner John McCain or 
fourth-place finisher Mike Huckabee.But very conservative was 27 percent of the states 
Republican electorate back then, smaller than somewhat conservative
