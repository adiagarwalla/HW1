iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

ho are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising 
kids together, when I think about those soldiers or airmen or Marines 
or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet

banning gay marriage.Seniors officials told Fox News that Obama was always planning 
to come out in favor of same-sex marriage before the election, even 
before the Democratic National Convention. But advisers ha

 consistent with less than 110,000 new jobs a month.There's still has a 
long way to go. The United States has regained only about 3.8 
million, or 43 percent, of the 8.8 million jobs lost during and 
immediately after the recession.The number of people receiving unemployment benefits also dropped. 
That is partly because extended benefit programs are winding down. More than 
6.4 million people received benefits during the week that ended April 21, 
down nearly 175,000 from the previous week.The government did release some good 
news this week: In March, employers advertised 3.74 million job openings, the 
most since July 2008. The increase in U.S. job openings suggests that 
weaker hiring gains in March and April could be temporary. It usually 
takes one to three months for employers to fill openings.

OKLAHOMA CITY  Mitt Romney says he believes marriage should be restricted 
to one man and one woman and that he's held that view 
"since running for office."Romney on Wednesday called same sex-marriage "a very tender 
and sensitive topic" as he contrasted his position with President Barack Obama's 
unequivocal declaration of support Wednesday for allowing same-sex couples to marry.Obama is 
the first president in history to support gay marriage. Polls show the 
country is evenly divided on the issue.Romney did not go so far 
as to accuse Obama of changing his position on the issue. Questioned 
by reporters, the presumptive Republican nominee for president said news reports indicate 
Obama has shifted his stance.Romney says states should be able to decide 
whether to grant certain legal benefits to same-sex couples.
