Carbon, in one form or another, is the base of all black pigments. By far th=
e most common of these, as used in structural plants, is graphite. Other bla=
ck pigments are lamp-black (including carbon black) and bone-black, the form=
er being produced in many grades, varying in price from twopence to half a c=
rown per pound. Bone-black, which is refuse from the sugar-house black, vari=
es in the percentage of carbon contained, which is usually about 10 or 12 pe=
r cent, the remainder being the mineral matter originally present in the bon=
e, and containing 3 or 4 per cent of carbonate, whilst most of the remainder=
 is phosphate of lime. Lamp-black is an absolutely impalpable powder, which =
having a small amount of greasy matter in it, greatly retards the drying of =
the oil with which it may be mixed. For this reason it is not used by itself=
, but is added in small quantity to other paints, which it affects by changi=
ng their colour, and probably their durability. For example, it is a common =
practice to add it to red lead, in order to tone down its brilliant colour, =
and also to correct the tendency it has to turn white, due to the conversion=
 of the red oxide of lead into the carbonate.
Black Stain for Iron.

For colouring iron and steel a dead black of superior appearance and permane=
ncy, the following is a good formula: 1 part bismuth chloride, 2 parts mercu=
ry bi-chloride, 1 part copper chloride, 6 parts hydrochloric acid, 5 parts a=
lcohol, and 50 parts lamp-black, these being all well mixed. To use this pre=
paration successfully=FF=FFthe article to be blacked or bronzed being first =
made clean and free from grease=FF=FFit is applied with a swab or brush, or,=
 better still, the object may be dipped into it; the liquid is allowed to dr=
y on the metal, and the latter is then placed in boiling water, the temperat=
ure being maintained for half an hour. If, after this, the colour is not so =
dark as is desired, the operation has simply to be repeated, and the result =
will be found satisfactory. After obtaining the desired degree of colour, th=
e latter is fixed, as well as much improved generally, by placing for a few =
minutes in a bath of boiling oil, or by coating the surface with oil, and he=
ating the object till the oil is completely driven off The intense black obt=
ained by this method is admirable.

Another black coating for ironwork, which is really a lacquer, is obtained b=
y melting ozokerite, which becomes a brown resinous mass, with a melting-poi=
nt at 140=FF=FF=FF=FF F. The melted mass is then further heated to 212=FF=FF=
=FF=FF F., the boiling-point of water. The objects to be lacquered are scour=
ed clean by rubbing with dry sand, and are dipped in the melted mass. They a=
re then allowed to drip, and the ozokerite is ignited by the objects being h=
eld over a fire. After the ozokerite has burned away, the flame is extinguis=
hed, and the iron acquires a firmly adhering black coating, which resists at=
mospheric influences, as well as acids and alkalies. If the black iron vesse=
ls are to contain alkaline liquids, the above operation is repeated.

A good cheap stock black paint or varnish for ironwork is prepared, as follo=
ws: Clear (solid) wood tar, 10 lb.; lamp black or mineral black, 11/4 b.; oi=
l of turpentine, 51/2 quarts. The tar is first heated in a large iron pot to=
 boiling-point, or nearly so, and the heat is continued for about 4 hours. T=
he pot is then removed from the fire out of doors, and while still warm, and=
 not hot, the turpentine, mixed with the black, is stirred in. If the varnis=
h is too thick to dry quickly, add more turpentine. Benzine can be used inst=
ead of turpentine, but the results are not so good. Asphaltum is preferable =
to the cheap tar.

To make another good black varnish for ironwork, take 8 lb. of asphaltum and=
 fuse it in an iron kettle, then add 2 gallons of boiled linseed oil, 1 lb. =
of litharge, 1/2 lb. of sulphate of zinc (add these slowly, or the mixture w=
ill boil over), and boil them for about 3 hours. Then, add 11/2 lb. of dark =
gum amber, and boil for 2 hours longer, or until the mass will become quite =
thick when cool. After this it should be thinned with turpentine to the prop=
er consistency.
Varnishes for Ironwork.

A reliable authority gives the following as a very good recipe for ironwork =
varnish. Take 2 lb. of tar oil, 1/2 lb. of pounded resin, and 1/2 lb. of asp=
haltum, and dissolve together, and then mix while hot in an iron kettle, tak=
ing all care to prevent the flames getting into contact with the mixture. Wh=
en cold the varnish is ready for application to outdoor ironwork. Another re=
cipe is to take 3 lb. of powdered resin, place it in a tin or iron vessel, a=
nd add thereto 21/2 pints of spirits of turpentine, which well shake, and th=
en let it stand for a day or two, giving it an occasional shake. Then add to=
 it 5 quarts of boiled oil, shake it thoroughly well all together, afterward=
s letting it stand in a warm room till it gets clear. The clear portion can =
then be drawn off and used, or ced with spirits of turpentine till of th=
e requisite consistency. For making a varnish suitable for iron patterns, ta=
ke sufficient oil of turpentine for the purpose of the job in hand, and drop=
 into it, drop by drop, some strong commercial oil of vitriol, when the acid=
 will cause a dark syrupy precipitate in the oil of turpentine, and continue=
 to add the drops of vitriol till the precipitate ceases to act, after which=
 pour off the liquid and wash the syrupy mass with water, when it will be re=
ady for use. When the iron pattern is to be varnished, it must be heated to =
a gentle degree, the syrupy product applied, and then the article allowed to=
 dry.

A fine black varnish suitable for the covering of broken places in sewing ma=
chines and similar articles, where the japanned surface has become injured o=
r scratched, can be made by taking some fine lamp-black or ivory-black, and =
thoroughly mixing it with copal varnish. The black must be in a very fine po=
wder, and to mix the more readily it should be made into a pasty mass with t=
urpentine. For the ordinary repairing shop this will be found very handy.
