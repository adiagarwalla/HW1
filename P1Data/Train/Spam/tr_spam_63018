reporters asked spokesman Jay Carney if the president made a mistake when 
he spoke about the drone campaign openly. Carney refused to go beyond 
what the president said and declared that he was "not going to

the protection of the public."The suspects were facing a number of terrorism 
charges, including conspiracy to cause explosions likely to endanger life or damage 
property and preparing for acts of terrorism between Nov. 1, 2010, and 
Dec. 21, 2010. They changed their previous not guilty pleas to guilty
