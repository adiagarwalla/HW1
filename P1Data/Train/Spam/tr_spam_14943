ly carrying to completion the revolutionary cause of juche through generations, the 
cause started by Kim Il Sung and led by Kim Jong Il 
to victory."But it was only in September, 2010, that the first ever 
adult picture of Kim Jong Un was run by state media -- 
after he was appointed as a four-star general and given senior ruling 
party posts, The (London) Times reported.The photo shows a young man, who 
looks not much older than a teenager, standing next to his father 
at a formal event clapping his hands.More recently, North Korean media has 
started calling the younger Kim the "Little General," The Times reported.US intelligence 
agencies have closely studied Kim Jong Un for nearly three years after 
word came out of Pyongyang that a political transition had begun, The 
Wall Street Journal reported.But Washington has also privately voiced concerns that the 
younger Kim might not be able to consolidate power as his father 
did after taking power in 1994, potentially lea
ling with North Korea over the past three years, since Pyongyang pulled 
out of six-nation aid-for-disarmament talks in 2009.Shortly after the North announced its 
withdrawal, it conducted its second nuclear test, following its first in 2006.In 
2010, the North upped the ante even further.In moves that some experts 
speculated was linked to Kim Jong Un's rise to power, a South 
Korean submarine was sunk and a South Korean island came under artillery 
fire -- seemingly unprovoked attacks within months of each other that left 
50 people dead and almost pitched the heavily militarized Korean peninsula into 
war.And underscoring the North's intent to develop its nuclear deterrent further, it 
unveiled a uranium enrichment facility that gave it a second way of 
generating fissile material to put in an atom bomb.Only in July 2011, 
when North-South tensions had eased, did the U.S. revive direct negotiations with 
Pyongyang, a prelude to a possible resumption of the six-nation tal
ding to greater instability.In recent months, state media began referring to him 
as "general," after having previously only used his official title -- vice-chairman 
of the central military commission of the Workers' Party of Korea, AFP 
reported."The latest move indicates Kim Jong Un is being put forward formally 
as a powerful leader like his father," Sejong Institute analyst Cheong Seong-Chang, 
a specialist in the succession issue, said in October."Such a title has 
been used internally, but North Korea now appears to be boosting the 
image of Jong Un as military leader," he said.Little is known about 
the succession. South Korea's top official on cross-border affairs said last month 
that there would be challenges in transferring power to the son.Kim Jong 
Il's only sister Kim Kyong hui and her husband Jang Song thaek, 
the country's unofficial number two leader, are expected to act as his 
guardian and throw their political weight behind him, analysts say.In a memoir
