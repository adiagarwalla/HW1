ection Act, I know the law is clear that it is not 
appropriate for a federal agency or official to retaliate against a whistleblower 
on the basis of a protected disclosure," Levin said. "The Air Force 
must now review the OSC report and promptly take appropriate action."Air Force 
Secretary Michael Donley said he will take "appropriate action" and has appointed 
a two-star general to review the findings. He said reprisals against whistleblowers 
are unacceptable.In a statement, Donley said he and the Air Force's top 
officer, Gen. Norton Schwartz, "believe strongly there is no place for reprisal 
in the Air Force. Reprisals against employees are unethical and illegal and 
counter to Air Force core values."In an earlier investigation report released in 
November, OSC officials said they had found "gross mismanagement" at the Dover 
facility, where small body parts of U.S. troops killed in Afghanistan were 
lost on two occasions.At the time, Air Force officials said they t
ewalled the congressional investigation of the gun-running scandal that sent some 2,000 
weapons to the Mexican cartels with the assistance of the U.S. Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.In December, Holder testified to the House 
Judiciary Committee that he understands Congress wants answers, and Justice Department employees 
were working "tirelessly to identify, locate and provide relevant information" to lawmakers 
"all while preserving the integrity of ongoing criminal investigations and prosecutions."He added 
that documents provided to congressional investigators show that department personnel relied on 
information provided by supervisors in Arizona thought to be in the best 
position to relay those facts, but some of that information was later 
found to be "inaccurate."The documents produced to date also belie the remarkable 
notion that this operation was conceived by department leaders, as some have 
claimed," Holder said. "It is my understanding
Mitt Romney heads into the next phase of the Republican presidential nominating 
contest carrying a big win under his belt, after reasserting his frontrunner 
status with a crushing victory over Newt Gingrich in Florida.However, Romney and 
the rest of the Republican candidates will have to fine-tune their approach 
as they enter the bevy of contests scattered all across the country 
in February, starting in Nevada this Saturday.There are no historically decisive primaries 
on the horizon, no big-ticket behemoths that are considered make-or-break for a 
primary candidate. Instead, the candidates face what could be a drawn-out race 
for delegates, one that will force the campaigns to make more strategic 
decisions about where and when to allocate resources.Gingrich vowed to execute such 
a campaign at his Florida rally Tuesday night, projecting a six-month battle 
in what he described as a two-person race between him and the 
Massachusetts moderate.As supporters waved signs

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">While President Obama will deliver another speech on the economy Wednesday in 
Northern Virginia to keep the focus on jobs, Catholic leaders across the 
country are warning another issue may blow up in his face come 
November.Catholics are fired up over new rules implementing Obama's health care reform 
law forcing Catholic universities, hospitals, and charities to provide insurance for their 
employees covering contraception -- even though that violates church teachings."When you push 
people of faith and you tell them the government is going to 
knock down the wall of separation of church and state and overreach 
like the Obama administration, you've got a war on your hands," Bill 
Donohue, president of the Catholic League, told Fox News.In an extraordinary move 
this past weekend, New York Cardinal-designate Timothy Dolan and other archbishops throughout 
the nation had their priests read letters denouncing the Obama administration policy 
from the pulpit at Sunday Mass
 other sanctions. But Moscow says it could lay the groundwork for later 
military intervention. Russia, a longtime ally of Assad, has insisted the crisis 
can be resolved by negotiations and that U.N. action thwarts any dialogue.Arab 
officials joined Western countries in trying to persuade Russia to back the 
measure.Deputy Arab League Secretary-General Ahmed bin Helli said Wednesday the League sought 
the U.N. resolution to back its peace plan and boost an Arab 
solution for the crisis, not to bring in international military action.The League 
"is still committed ... to solving this crisis in the Arab framework, 
away from any outside intervention," he said during a visit to Baghdad.Moscow's 
stance is motivated in part by its strategic and defense ties, including 
weapons sales, with Syria. Russia also rejects what it sees as a 
a world order dominated by the U.S.The Associated Press contributed to this 
report.
ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources, 
especially as individual members keep trimming their budgets and the U.S reshapes 
its military strategy to focus on regions beyond Europe, the bloc's top 
defense officials said Tuesday."We want to tackle the challenges we face by 
doing more together and doing it better, by looking for greater efficiencies 
and value for money (and) by pooling and sharing of military capabilities," 
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton said."This is the only pragmatic way 
forward given the growing demand for the European Union to become a 
more capable, coherent and strategic global actor," said Ashton, who is also 
responsible for the bloc's security policy.The EU's 27 governments spend $265 billion 
on defense annually -- more than any other nation except the United 
States. But military spending has already shrunk 15
