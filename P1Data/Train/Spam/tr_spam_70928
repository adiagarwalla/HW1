Absolutely delicious!! All of their pastas seem to be fresh and hand-made, and they really know how to balance out the tastes in their meals. 11508873 Between three people, we split the Lobster Ravioli and a special pasta of the day: Cavatelli.

The lobster ravioli really surprised me! Usually, I don't like creamy pastas, nor am I a huge fan of ravioli. But something about the richness of this dish made it so wonderfully delicious, that I know I'm going to 11508873 be dreaming about it later.

The cavatelli was also amazing! 75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe It came with broccoli, chicken sausage (which was more like ground chicken than sausage), bell peppers, and tomatoes in a garlic olive oil sauce. It was a little heavier than I expected, but still quite light. It also had a little kick of spicy to it that I think really rounded out the dish nicely.

Admittedly, I got hungry later that night after sharing two dishes between 3 people, but at the time, it felt like just the right amount of food. I will say that service was a bit weird. Even though it was completely empty when I went (only one other table was occupied), it took our waiter about 10 minutes to actually give us a menu. But other than that, I love love love the food here!75e6266bb6d988d0c89409301d1246fe
