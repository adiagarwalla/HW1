st and climate change blogger, told FoxNews.com. If other scientists cannot replicate 
your work, it brings your work into question.Is the Department of Energy 
to blame? The Climategate emails reveal correspondence only between Jones and his 
colleagues -- not between him and the DoE."Whats missing," Watts said, "is 
a ... directive from DoE that they should withhold station data gathered 
under their grant. The email may be there, but ... still under 
lock and key.Chris Horner, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, 
wants that key. He recently filed Freedom of Information acts with the 
DoE, requesting the emails they exchanged with Jones."So far no administration department 
has bothered to respond, indicating they  believe the time bought with 
stonewalling might just get them off the hook for disclosure," Horner told 
FoxNews.com."Not with us, it won't," he said.The Department of Energy has until 
December 29 before it must legally respond to Horner'

has been funded by the U.S. Dept of Energy, and I have 
their agreement that the data neednt be passed on. I got this 
[agreement] in 2007, Jones wrote in a May 13, 2009, email to 
British officials, before listing reasons he did not want them to release 
data.Two months later, Jones reiterated that sentiment to colleagues, saying that the 
data "has to be well hidden. Ive discussed this with the main 
funder (U.S. Dept of Energy) in the past and they are happy 
about not releasing the original station data.A third email from Jones written 
in 2007 echoes the idea: "They are happy with me not passing 
on the station data," he wrote.The emails have outraged climate-change skeptics who 
say they can't trust climate studies unless they see the raw data 
-- and how it has been adjusted."In every endeavor of science, making 
your work replicable by others is a basic tenet of proof, Anthony

in the case.Nagy Navarro welcomed the announcements, but said other senior officials 
should be ousted because of the constant meddling into journalists' work. As 
he spoke outside state television headquarters, supporters stopped by with bags full 
of fruit juice and soft drinks.Two civilian activists have also joined the 
three journalists on the hunger strike. Nagy Navarro, who also leads a 
trade union of media workers, said he would continue the hunger strike 
as long as doctors allow him to or until more top editors 
are fired.A spokesman for state media said the hunger strike had turned 
into a political act and that no other personnel changes were planned."We 
continue to study and analyze how to reform and improve the system 
of news production and news stories to avoid repeating such serious errors," 
said Laszlo Szabo, communications director of MTVA, the state Media Service Support 
and Asset Management Fund.

said he remembered McQueary and Paterno describing what the younger coach saw 
only in a very general way."I had the impression it was inappropriate," 
Schultz told the grand jury. "I had the feeling it was some 
king of wrestling activity and maybe Jerry might have grabbed a young
