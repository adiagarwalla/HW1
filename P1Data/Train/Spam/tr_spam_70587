209851749 burrata was wonderful, and some pizza to start and then I had 209851749 lamb chops which were excellent!  I snuck a bite of a friends bolognese which was really yummy and 209851749 Salmon looked great as well.  They had a good wine selection and 209851749 chocolate mouse for dessert was decadent, as it should be. After we passed 209851749 cool photo booths to arrive at 209851749 hip bar with a panoramic view of 209851749 city, truly stunning and unique.  209851749 couches were comfy, staff nice and inviting with no snob factor. There was a great mix of people from around 209851749 globe in many different fields which I thought was unique to this town. 209851749 only thing that makes So-so House worth finding someone who has access to it is 209851749 astounding views you take in as soon as you get to 209851749 club's restaurant/bar level. 209851749 view is like visual Xanax. It calms 209851749 LA crazy, even if for only a lunch hour. You feel that time stops. That is until you realize 209851749 grumbling is actually your stomach, not an earthquake, and you've been waiting over a half hour for your salad and tap water. My salad at lunch was delicious, but something I could have purchased at Artisan Cheese Gallery for $2 to $3 less and it wouldn't have included 209851749 side of 'tude from 209851749 wait staff. Even 209851749 member I came to meet said they don't treat people well. Hmm...then why be a member? At least we didn't have 209851749 experience like 209851749 guy at 209851749 table next to us who was on 209851749 verge of a meltdown when he got up angrily in search of our server. For a weekday lunch crowd, most people were there for business lunches - some true business, power suited out, and others LA thrift store chic. Bottom line, 209851749 restaurant was solid A-OK country club fare. Maybe exclusivity means more to some people, but in my opinion more often than not most LA nightclubs give off just as much of a "members only" vibe, and Soho House just made it official; which doesn't make 209851749 experience any better, only leaves you expecting more. If you have view-envy and don't think you can sniff out a member, just order a salad to go from ACG, hike to 209851749 top of Runyon Canyon, and you're there (only you'll probably have a lot more human eye candy) 209851749 servers were nice and remembered my name for 209851749 entire night, which was completely unexpected since I didn't make a scene or anything. However, there were only 2 of them for about 50 people. If they were only responsible for drinks or food, it would have been all right but they were taking care of everything. So we either had a drink or food in our hands, never both. Maybe it was a fault in 209851749 organizers planning, but it didn't work out too great.
