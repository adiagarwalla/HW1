A "Weird" wild fruit has just recently been found to be one of the greatest losing weight supports  ever discovered.  
Recently  featured on the Dr. Oz Show, where he called it "the most exciting development in losing weight to date."

See the results here: http://www.dealsbrands.eu/l/lt7WG296E25D/25V45F62IT27ID16628916M532739568
 
It has been said that this is gaining popularity in Hollywood, too, as both an energizer, appetite blocker and a new losing weight secret. 
Although most importantly, it comes from a health fruit and has been endorsed by many doctors.
But, does it work? We put it to the test.
