Went for a quick day trip to STL 16183067 and lucked out finding Bogart's!  We had a pretty large group, so we got to sample a number of items.

For sandwiches, I asked which were the best ones, 16183067 and the cashier said it was a tie between tri-tip sirloin and burnt ends.  My mom and I got one each and really enjoyed both!  Others tried the pulled pork sandwich and gave good reviews as well.  I'd definitely recommend the sirloin!  

For the meat plates, the ribs were a hit!  16183067 The pork had good reviews as well.  Only item they would have replaced was the brisket.  

For sides, we tried almost all of them between our entire group, and my favs were the beans and applesauce (huh?! yes!!).  I also liked the chips, if you're looking for something simple.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
