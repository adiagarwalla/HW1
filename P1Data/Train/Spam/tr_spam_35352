choose 13 additional delegates.The slate is voted on at the party's state 
convention in June.The system puts a premium on getting the most votes 
in individual congressional districts. If a candidate's supporters can control a congressional 
district convention, they can choose national delegates and slate committee members who

and the lawyers representing the protesters. It also became harder for media 
to cover the proceeding after the judge imposed a ban with high 
ranking Egyptian officials summoned to testify.In the last hearing in September, Field 
Marshal Hussein Tantawi, who heads Egypt's ruling military council that took power 
after Mubarak's fall, gave his testimony under a total media blackout.Journalists were 
barred from the court and forbidden to report any leaked details of 
Tantawi's testimony. Many believe Tantawi -- who was Mubarak's defense minister for
