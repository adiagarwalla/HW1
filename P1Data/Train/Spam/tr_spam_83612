mptive move, the committee backed an amendment by Rep. Doug Lamborn, R-Colo., 
prohibiting any spending on implementing an international agreement on activities in space 
unless the pact has been ratified by the Senate or authorized by 
law.The idea of another round of domestic base closings lost by a 
44-18 vote. Lawmakers have challenged the savings from previous closings. Defense Secretary 
Leon Panetta had proposed two rounds, but there's no enthusiasm in Congress 
for that during an election year.The committee chairman, Rep. Howard "Buck" McKeon, 
R-Calif., said the legislation represents a "modest" increase over the administration's proposal 
and "actively rebuilds the military within the constrained resources available to us."Smith 
said he was pleased that the bill includes new conditions on providing 
aid to Pakistan. "It is imperative that Pakistan support our counterterrorism efforts," 
he said.Election-year maneuvering over the size of the Pentagon budget is unf
He probably got out a little over his skis, but out of 
generosity of spirit. Would I have preferred to have done this in 
my own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being 
a lot of notice to everybody? Of course. But all is well 
that ends well.-- President Obama in an interview with ABC News.President Obama 
blamed the clumsy rollout of his reversion to his pre-2008 support of 
same-sex marriage on Vice President Joe Biden.- The Obama narrative, reinforced with 
background briefings to media members is that Biden bungled the calculated plan 
of the president to publicly reverse the position he publicly adopted for 
the 2008 election: personally opposed to same-sex marriage but indifferent to state-level 
efforts to establish it.Obamas new public position is that he is personally 
in favor of people of the same sex being able to marry 
but officially indifferent to efforts on the state level to establish or 
prevent the practice. His position prior to his nation

would fight efforts to prohibit such marriages, so he has almost gotten 
back to where he was.Federalism is an unlikely retreat for a president 
who has favored federal intervention in everything from conscientious objections of religious 
groups regarding insurance regulations to state rules regarding the capture of illegal 
immigrants. The Obama Justice Department, for instance, is currently suing several states 
to prevent them from requiring identification at polling places.But with North Carolinians, 
including at least 35 percent of Democratic voters, having just made their 
state the 30th to approve some form of ban on same-sex marriage, 
the president can hardly go all the way back to his original 
position of fighting efforts to block same-sex marriage.Obama is very keen to 
win North Carolina again, though that prospect looks increasingly unlikely, especially given 
Obamas partial public r
 nd John decided to separate, she was concerned that when she died, 
there would not be a man around that loved her," Palmieri said.Palmieri 
said she promised to be there for Edwards, but her dying friend 
continued to hold on to her feeling of loss.Edwards is accused of 
using campaign donors to pay for the cover-up of his affair with 
Hunter during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. 
He has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations 
and faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts.During Palmieri's testimony, Edwards buried his head 
in his hands. His daughter, Cate Upham, who who has attended most 
of the trial and was present during the morning's session, was not 
in the courtroom at the time.Palmieri, who now works for President Obma 
as deputy communications director, was asked by defense lawyers about a 2007 
confrontation at an Iowa Hotel in which Elizabeth Edward
The following is a list of President Obama's "evolving" statements on same-sex 
marriage."I favor legalizing same-sex marriages, and would fight efforts to prohibit such 
marriages." -- Obama's answer in a questionnaire during his 1996 run for 
Illinois state Senate "Undecided" -- his answer in another questionnaire on the 
same-sex marriage question during his re-election race for the same office in 
1998"I am a fierce supporter of domestic-partnership and civil-union laws. I am 
not a supporter of gay marriage as it has been thrown about 
primarily just as a strategic issue." -- Obama's response during an interview 
with the Windy City Times, a gay newspaper, in February 2004"I believe 
that marriage is the union between a man and a woman. Now, 
for me as a Christian ... it is also a sacred union." 
-- Obama's response in April 2008 during a presidential campaign forum"I have 
been to this point unwilling to sign on to same-sex marriage primarily 
because of my understa
