is a question the study ducks, noting that it is only advising 
EPA on how to bring it within the agencys canon.The experts take 
their definition from an Obama Administration executive order of October, 2009, entitled 
Federal Leadership in Environmental, Energy and Economic Performance. It defines sustainability in 
sweeping fashion as the ability to create and maintain conditions, under which 
humans and nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit fulfilling the 
social, economic, and other requirements of present and future generations.The study specifically 
notes that although addressing economic issues is not a core part of 
EPAs mission, it is explicitly part of the definition of sustainability.The experience 
of the European Union is deemed particularly relevant to achieving the sustainability 
goal.That Europea

Raykovitz cited a Nov. 6 Second Mile statement that referred only to 
inappropriate conduct: "At no time was The Second Mile made aware of 
the very serious allegations contained in the Grand Jury report."The statement also 
said Curley, who has been placed on leave, told Raykovitz the shower 
incident "had been internally reviewed and that there was no finding of 
wrongdoing."But Lunsford said the charity's board couldn't take action in 2002 that 
might have prevented other assaults of children "if there's a cover-up from 
the source."Even if Raykovitz had only limited information, he still should have 
acted more aggressively in 2002 when contacted by Curley and should have 
viewed Curley's ban on Sandusky bringing Second Mile kids to campus as 
"a red flag," Lunsford said.As the person in charge, Raykovitz was legally 
required to provide the board all available information whether he believed it

hike built into their loan -- the mortgage provider would then send 
that extra revenue to the Treasury.The idea behind the fee is to 
encourage more homeowners to get into the private market, as opposed to 
seeking loans backed by troubled entities like Fannie and Freddie."Taxpayers are losing 
every quarter on Fannie and Freddie," a senior Senate Democratic aide said. 
"We want to lessen the burden on the taxpayers (who are on 
the hook for failed government-backed loans)."The aide added, "This is an incentive 
to go to the private-sector mortgage market."A fact sheet on the Senate 
bill sent out Saturday to House Republicans noted that the offset has 
"bipartisan support" and was included in the House GOP-backed payroll tax cut 
bill. It also was included in President Obama's list of suggestions to 
the now-defunct "Super Committee" tasked with cing the deficit.The House still must 
vote on the bill.Th
