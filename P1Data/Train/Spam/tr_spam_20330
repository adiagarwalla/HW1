<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Very close to a 4 but a couple disappointing misses held it back just barely.  i do want to mention that the service here was great.  22564968 A friend and I were promptly seated upon arrival for 7:45 pm reservation.  The Waiter was outstanding and had great knowledge of the menu and wine pairings as well.  And finally, Mr. Masraff himself, the owner of the establishment came by to thank us for coming and to check up on our meal, as he did with pretty much every other table around us. (I've come to find out that he does this very often and what a great personal touch.  Really shows the passion he has and the "care" in wanting his diners to have a great experience).  Let's go onto the food:

Garlic Seared Calamari (3.5/5) - 22564968 I loved the flavors coated on these but for me it just comes down to the texture of the calamari itself.  Personally it was just a little "rubbery" for my liking and some of the pieces were just too big in my opinion.  i can def see why this is a favorite app for many people though.  Different from your typical fried calamari at most restaurants and  If you are okay with the texture, it's a great dish.

Jumbo Lump Crab Cake (3/5) - 53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea I pretty much order the crab cake at any restaurant i go to as one of my apps.  For me, the one here was just very forgetful. Nothing really impressed me about it and I thought it was just mediocre

Pan Seared Halibut (3/5) - 22564968 I thought the fish was a little dry for my liking and there wasn't nearly enough of the sauce to help compensate.  These are minor complaints on my end as I thought the fish was still pretty good and all the accompanying elements were spot on (Just wish there was more of the vanilla ction sauce!).  I just think a restaurant of this caliber shouldn't even these minor mistakes.

Hawaiian Swordfish (4/5) - I liked this dish more than the Halibut.  The fish was moist and the skin was crispy, exactly how i like it.  Once again, all the side elements and sauces were fantastic.

Sorbet Terrine (4/5) - 22564968 I believe the flavors change periodically but during my visit it was Lemon, Passion Fruit, and Strawberry.  I loved this as a way to end my meal and my only minor complaint was that the Lemon section didn't have the same consistency as the other two flavors.

I'll def go back to try some other dishes.  Grading a little hard on this place based on the reputation it has.53d3cf06902f9453238a67013c0a87ea
