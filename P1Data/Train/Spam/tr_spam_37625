 reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o
 as the public's outlook on the economy appears to be improving. 
For the first time since spring, more said the economy got better 
in the past month than said it got worse.The president's approval rating 
on unemployment shifted upward -- from 40 percent in October to 45 
percent in the latest poll -- as the jobless rate fell to 
8.6 percent last month, its lowest level since March 2009.But Obama's approval 
rating on his handling of the economy overall remains stagnant: 39 percent 
approve and 60 percent disapprove.Heading into his re-election campaign, the president faces 
a conflicted public that does not support his steering of the economy, 
the most dominant issue for Americans, or his reforms to health care, 
one of his signature accomplishments. Yet they are grappling with whether to 
replace him with Republican contenders Mitt Romney or Newt Gingrich."I think he's 
doing the best he can. The problem is the Congress won't help 
at all," said Rosario Navarro, a Dem

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Sony Pictures ClassicsLove him or hate him, Roman Polanski is back. The 
self-exiled filmmaker hasnt directed a comedy since 1967s The Fearless Vampire Killers, 
and boy does it show.Carnage attempts to create comedy out of irony. 
Two boys get into a schoolyard brawl and their sets of parents 
meet to civilly resolve the issue. But things dont go according to 
plan. Pride mixed with jealousy, a little dash of contempt and the 
two bourgeois couples spiral out of control into a vomitous (seriously) battle 
of childish quarrels. Unfortunately the only irony is that Carnage, directed by 
one of cinema's most acclaimed filmmakers, and adapted from Yasmina Rezas uproarious 
stage play God of Carnage, is rarely funny and falls terribly flat 
on celluloid.Running a mere 80 minutes, Carnage still feels longer than it 
should. Confined to only four characters and an upper crust Brooklyn apartment, 
Carnage is essentially the stage play on screen; little is added to 
make the film 
 llions of dollars more in Libyan assets frozen elsewhere are also expected 
to be released.The Security Council froze the assets of five key Libyan 
financial institutions in March following the uprising against Qaddafi's 42-year rule and 
his deadly crackdown on protesters.After Qaddafi's death and the end of the 
eight-month civil war in October, the Security Council eased some financial restrictions 
to allow a resumption of trading. But the freeze on assets that 
the Central Bank and Foreign Bank held before March remained in place 
until Friday's delisting.Britain's Hague welcomed the sanctions committee's decision, saying "Libya's government 
will now have full access to the significant funds needed to help 
rebuild the country, to underpin stability and to ensure that Libyans can 
make the transactions that are essential to everyday life.""The transitional government must 
now redouble its efforts to build a transparent and accountable financial system 
which will un
o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
