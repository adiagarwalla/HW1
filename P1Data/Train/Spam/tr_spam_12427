Linked to this is the idea that the SNB was concerned about its potential exit policy. As yesterday demonstrated, as soon as the floor is removed the SNB will take a huge loss due to the massive appreciation of the CHF and the depreciation of its FX reserves. The larger the reserves get, the larger the potential loss gets.*cr*
