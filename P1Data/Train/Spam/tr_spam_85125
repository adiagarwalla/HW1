urgently needed projects next year. He also said 30,000 workers will be 
trained.A cold shutdown normally means a nuclear reactor's coolant system is at 
atmospheric pressure and its reactor core is at a temperature below 212 
degrees Fahrenheit (100 degrees Celsius), making it impossible for a chain reaction 
to take place.According to TEPCO, temperature gauges inside the Fukushima reactors show 
the pressure vessel is at around 70 C (158 F). The government 
also says the amount of radiation now being released around the plant 
is at or below 1 millisievert per year -- equivalent to the 
annual legal exposure limit for ordinary citizens before the crisis began.Yet, the 
complex still faces numerous concerns, triggering criticism that the announcement of "cold 
shutdown conditions" is based on a political decision rather than science. Nobody 
knows exactly where and how the melted fuel ended up in each 
reactor, and the plant is struggling with the vast amount of radioactiv
blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces

and $244 billion, or 14 percent, by 2008.In a May 2007 speech 
in New York, he said Freddie had "basically no subprime exposure," according 
to the suit."Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives told the world that 
their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was," said Robert 
Khuzami, SEC's enforcement director."These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute 
investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the 
market about the amount of risk."Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about 
half of U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million loans.The Bush administration seized 
control of the mortgage giants in September 2008.So far, the companies have 
cost taxpayers almost $150 billion -- the largest bailout of the financial 
crisis. They could cost up to $259 billion, according to its government 
regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Administration.The o

health insurance.Under the law, the benefits package must include such fundamentals as 
inpatient and outpatient care, emergency services, maternity and childhood care, prescription drugs, 
preventive screenings and labs.It must cover mental health and substance abuse treatment, 
as well as rehabilitation for physical and cognitive disorders. Such add-ons are 
often not fully covered by frugal plans that are now the best 
that many small businesses can afford.Traditionally regulated by the states, private insurance 
benefits vary widely across the country.Large companies can opt out of most 
state rules.Consumer advocates had hoped Obama would set a robust standard for 
the nation as a whole.But his administration only met them part way."The

Morgan walked in disguised in a wig and glasses and shot her 
seven times with a handgun before fleeing.Prosecutor Timothy Liston argued in closing

hates," Liston said. "She's successful, she's beautiful, she's intelligent, she's Jewish, she

a 2006 graduate of the Westtown School, a Quaker boarding school outside
