The House has voted to extend the life of the Export-Import Bank, 
a key source of financing for American companies, ranging from small businesses 
to giants such as Boeing, trying to sell goods overseas.The vote was 
a victory for the business community which has urged lawmakers to renew 
the bank's charter before it expires at the end of the month.Reauthorization 
of the independent federal agency, which is self-financing and returns money to 
the Treasury, was complicated by a campaign among several influential conservative groups 
to eliminate the bank. They argued that the bank's loans to American 
exporters and foreign buyers distort markets and pick winners and losers.The legislation 
now moves to the Senate, which is expected to act on it 
quickly.											Sign

blasts happened in quick succession during morning rush hour, with an initial 
small explosion followed by a larger bomb that appeared aimed at onlookers 
and rescue crews arriving at the scene. Paramedics wearing rubber gloves collected 
human remains from the pavement as heavily damaged cars and pickup trucks 
smoldered.There was no claim of responsibility for Thursday's blasts. But an al-Qaida-inspired 
group has claimed responsibility for several past explosions, raising fears that terrorist 
groups are entering the fray and exploiting the chaos.In addition to the 
55 dead, the ministry also said there were 15 bags of human 
remains, meaning the death
