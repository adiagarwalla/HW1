		  prepared dishes that you would come to expect from an iron chef, because it wasn't.  It just wasn't.  Wasn't worth 18934716 visit, 18934716 drinks were weak, and 18934716 food was ordinary.  This ruined one of my sinful delights, watching "Throw Down".    How can I watch Bobby knowing his restaurants don't live up to 18934716 hype.   How can I watch knowing he would never skimp on alcohol on his shows, but his restaurants are serving up some weak cactus margaritas. 18934716 prices are high and 18934716 value is low.  There are many other good places to eat in Vegas, unfortunately,  Mesa Grill isn't one of them Sorry Bobby, perhaps you should do a Throw down here, you might actually this one. This place was pretty fantastic. Thank you Bobby Flay for bringing your food creations into this world. Started out my meal with 18934716 tiger shrimp tamale...sensational. I have never tasted anything like it or even heard or anything like it. I was pleasantly surprised by its taste, which was a little sweet with 18934716 tamale and savory because of 18934716 taste of 18934716 shrimp. Perfect flavor and unique combination. Ordered 18934716 lamb porterhouse chops. 18934716 flavor of 18934716 lamb was also a little sweet but over all delicious. This is where I had to take a star off though - 18934716 lamb was over cooked. I had asked for medium and received medium well. I didn't complain because 18934716 seasoning was delicious, but I would hope that a place that capitalizes on grilling would grill meat how they said they would. We spoke with 18934716 waitress afterward and she said that some of 18934716 cooks in 18934716 back were getting orders that were either overcooked or undercooked. I don't care how amazing 18934716 flavors are...that isn't cool. 18934716 service here was exceptional, I came here with a large group and there were no mix ups with our orders and they knew exactly what they were doing. Friendly staff who were willing to listen to us and really cared if we liked 18934716 food. One person in our party had a steak that was very overcooked and before he mentioned anything 18934716 waitress saw his disappointment and had a new dish made up for him. My dish wasn't bad enough to send back and I was starving by that time so not too much complaining about my lamb. BF and I are a big fan of Bobby Flay, so we were pretty excited to eat at Mesa. Sadly, Bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there 18934716 week before. Ah well. 18934716 restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all 18934716 waitstaff were very professional and friendly. They have several lounge "cubicles" to wait while your table is being setup too, which I thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. Normally, I'd order steak, but our waiter told us 18934716 signature dish was 18934716 New Mexican Spice Rubbed Pork Tenderloin, so out of six people, 4 of us ordered 18934716 pork, and 18934716 other two had 18934716 rib-eye. When they brought out 18934716 dinners, I thouht they
