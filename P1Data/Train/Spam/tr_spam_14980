Dear Sir,

I write from the desk of the manager United Bank of Egypt
(UBE).In my bank covered an abandoned sum of $33.3musd in an
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer, by
name, Mr.Robert Chapman,who was African area director for
Wycliffe bible translators international, who died along
with his wife, in January 2000 in a Kenyan plane crash in
the coast of Abidjan, Ivory coast.

We have been expecting his next of kin to come over and
claim his money because we can not release it unless
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines. Based upon
this discovery I decided to make business with you and
release the money to you as the next of kin or relation of
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement.

Certain percentage of this money will be for you as my
foreign partner. Upon receipt of your reply I will direct
you on the next line of action(Application)thereafter I will
visit your country for disbursement according to
the percentage agreed.

Yours faithfully

Maher Labib Abou Steit,
General Manager,United Bank of Egypt.106,
Kasr El-Aini st,
Cairo center building, Cairo, Egypt.
