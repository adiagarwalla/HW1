hazelsamuel@fs.net, 

Consider this shocking fact:  Most of us forget 80 percent of what we learn!

I'm  Dr. Steven Klayman.  I recently discovered a new system that's helping 
my patients and me STOP and reverse up to 12 years of mental decline.

This incredible prevention technique will help bring about the end of Alzheimer's disease and age-related forgetfulness.

End forgetfulness and memory loss for good, here: http://safe.corelackfocusedcontrol.click



Never Forget,

Dr. Steven Klayman

Apparently the vibe of this place changes 8917131 a lot depending on what else is going on around it. I was brought here on a quiet night, but be assured the food turned the volume of my joy sounds way up.

But before we get to the gluttonous, succulent, stupidly saliva-inducing chicken schwarma... 

The circular bar is great to sit at for people watching, 8917131 sports watching (should you want to, but if you don't, you can easily avoid the screens), bartender chatting (they might even take a shot with you), and beer tap perusing (nice selection of microbrews). Loved the span and quality of clientele and staff here, felt right at home.

Now how the hell can you go wrong with a chicken schwarma that is generous with garlic sauce and all other filling, sating, titillating fixings? You can't. I shared the sandwich and a fattoush salad and curly fries and that was a feast enough for three. If you're not crazy about having your veggies in an (un)healthy dousing of oil, make sure to get the dressing on the side.9b44ae09d09d357e9cd1ba1cc5c1244a
