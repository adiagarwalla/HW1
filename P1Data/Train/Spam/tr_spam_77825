Hello. I want to be with a man who wants to start a lasting relationship and who can care of his beloved woman. 
I am searching for a man with whom we can talk about everything in the world and to be just two halves. 
My name is Dina. Profiles:2968621 - http://kqxuh.hints.me 
I am a sensitive, caring, patient, delicate and very feminine lady. 
I have a very attractive appearance. 
My eyes are like two little lights that are ready to warm up the heart of my beloved man. I like  men with some mystery inside. 

I have friends and good people that surround me. I also like staying at home and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. 
I strive to get my true love. 
Regards, 
Dina.
