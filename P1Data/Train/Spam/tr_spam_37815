<p style="font-size:xx-small;">attorney for Doby and that an extradition hearing hadn't been scled.A not-guilty 
plea was entered on Crain's behalf during her arraignment Thursday in Pottawatomie 
County. Her attorney, Cregg Webb, did not return a phone message Friday 
left at his office in Shawnee.Smothermon said he's also discussing the possibility 
of federal charges, but that Oklahoma statutes carry lengthier sentences."We want to 
make sure we can get the maximum amount of time that we 
can," he said.The case first came to light in November when the 
parents of a 9-year-old girl contacted police after their daughter attended a 
pizza party at Crain's McLoud home. The girl told police Crain had 
several girls change into Christmas-themed bras and panties and then took pictures 
of them decorating a Christmas tree and made a video of them 
doing a cheer dance, according to a police affidavit.Police later uncovered more 
than 100 sexually explicit photographs of young girls from Crain's cellphone, 
 ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
 ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine
