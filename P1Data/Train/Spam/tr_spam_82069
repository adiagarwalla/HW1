Delight
 Similar to the Butterfly http://www.natik.nichost.ru/lifelessness position, the Delight is an intimate position. The receiver sits at the very edge of a bed, couch, etc. while their partner kneels on the floor between their legs and enters. If you find that your alignment is off, use pillows under the receiver's bottom, or under the giver's knees to adjust as needed.
