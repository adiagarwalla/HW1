s been a sensation among U.S. readers yet failed to challenge "Mission: 
Impossible" and the other established franchises at the top of the box 
office.Beloved by generations of readers overseas, "Tintin" launched internationally two months ahead 
of its U.S. release. But the blockbuster global attention, with nearly $250 
million already in the bank from foreign markets, did not translate to 
crowds in the United States.The calendar made it a tough weekend for 
Hollywood, with Christmas Eve -- always a slow night for movie-going -- 
falling on Saturday, usually the best day of the week at theaters.Christmas 
Day typically is a strong one for movies, as fans squeeze in 
a film between unwrapping presents and sitting down to family dinners.Two big 
holiday releases -- Spielberg's World War I epic "War Horse" and Tom 
Hanks and Sandra Bullock's Sept. 11 drama "Extremely Loud &amp; Incredibly Close" 
-- opened Christmas Day, but estimates on their revenues will not be 
available 
qi dictator Saddam Hussein allowed the rebel People's Mujahedeen to set up 
the camp during the war with Iran in the 1980s.When Saddam was 
overthrown in the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, the camp came under U.S. 
military protection, but American forces handed over security responsibilities for the site 
to the Baghdad authorities in January 2009.The camp has been back in 
the spotlight since a controversial April raid by Iraqi security forces left 
at least 34 people dead and scores injured.

 key has meaning or is a message from father to son, 
Oskar embarks on a journey through New York City to find the 
keys owner and significance.Oskars journey is poignant, if not a little frustrating. 
He befriends an elderly mute neighbor, subtly and charmingly played by Max 
Von Sydow, who assists the boy in his quest. With each new 
character Oskar interviews about the key, his eyes  and ours -- 
are opened to a life of beauty, diversity and wisdom.The performances are 
fresh and powerful. Thomas Horn, in his film debut, is a tour 
de force as crestfallen and determined Oskar Schell. For a young actor, 
Horn carries an impressive range of emotions over two hours. Supporting the 
boy is Oscar-winner Sandra Bullock as his grief-stricken mother. Bullock has little 
screen time but she gives the most convincing performance of her career. 
The film also features John Goodman, Viola Davis and Zoe Caldwell.Eric Roths 
nimble screenplay and composer Alexandre Desplats delicate
