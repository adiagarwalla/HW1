the vote set off a spate of protests led by citizens unhappy 
with Vladimir Putin's rule.The report accuses the U.S. of blocking independent candidates 
from elections and criticizes the practice of allowing governors to nominate senators

both.While the State Department has beefed up tourist services in recent years, 
cing wait times significantly for would-be visitors will likely be a challenge 
as officials try to balance terrorist threats and illegal immigration with tight 
budgets that limit hiring."Security is job one for us," said Edward Ramotowski, 
managing director of the department's visa services. "The reason we have a
