 URGENT: Read This Before You Take Another E-ZPass Lane<br>
 <br>
 Dear reader,
 </div>
 <div>
 Last week, something crazy happened.
 </div>
 <div>
 I met with a CIA insider at a corner office in New York City.
 </div>
 <div>
 He began talking about a secret plan... one that could undermine America&#39;s financial system.
 </div>
 <div>
 A plan that&#39;s set to radically change the future of our nation.
 </div>
 <div>
 If this wasn&#39;t coming from a guy who has worked with the CIA, the Pentagon and 14 other intelligence agencies, I wouldn&#39;t have believed.
 </div>
 <div>
 After this plan comes into effect, our country will look a lot different than it looks today.
 </div>
 <div>
 For example, you won&#39;t believe how the government might end up using E-ZPass lanes.
 </div>

       The Roman world was divided for the time between these two men, Antony receiving the government of the East, Octavian that of the West. In the year which had preceded this division Cleopatra had wavered between the two opposite factions at Rome. In so doing she had excited the suspicion of Antony, and he now demanded of her an explanation.

One must have some conception of Antony himself in order to understand the events that followed. He was essentially a soldier, of excellent family, being related to Caesar himself. As a very young man he was exceedingly handsome, and bad companions led him into the pursuit of vicious pleasure. He had scarcely come of age when he found that he owed the enormous sum of two hundred and fifty talents, equivalent to half a million dollars in the money of to-day. But he was much more than a mere man of pleasure, given over to drinking and to dissipation. Men might tell of his escapades, as when he drove about the streets of Rome in a common cab, dangling his legs out of the window while he shouted forth drunken songs of revelry. This was not the whole of Antony. Joining the Roman army in Syria, he showed himself to be a soldier of great personal bravery, a clever strategist, and also humane and merciful in the hour of ilover 15840e33bd94aca44f8aa_6559bd54 victory.

Unlike most Romans, Antony wore a full beard. His forehead was large, and his nose was of the distinctive Roman type. His look was so bold and masculine that people likened him to Hercules. His democratic manners endeared him to the army. He wore a plain tunic covered with a large, coarse mantle, and carried a huge sword at his side, despising ostentation. Even his faults and follies added to his popularity. He would sit down at the common soldiers' mess and drink with them, telling them stories and clapping them on the back. He spent money like water, quickly recognizing any daring deed which his legionaries performed. In this respect he was like Napoleon; and, like Napoleon, he had a vein of florid eloquence which was criticized by literary men, but which went straight to the heart of the private soldier. In a word, he was a powerful, virile, passionate, able man, rough, as were nearly all his countrymen, but strong and true.
