<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">This is definitely not your ordinary kind of pizza 21360172 and if you're not from the California area, then you'll want to check this place out. Yes, it is vegetarian and yes, most of the pizzas don't have a base sauce either. I know, you meat and pizza lovers are probably cringing a little. But with over 3,000 reviews on this place, you have to wonder what they are doing right! Are you indecisive? This place makes it really easy if you are. You only have ONE choice of pizza here each day. And to be honest, after trying this one pizza, I'm assuming all the pizzas here are good so it doesn't really matter what day you come in. 

Okay, so there is usually a line. It forms before 4:30 dinner rush even hits and it continues to form outside. 21360172 It looks intimidating and appears to be one of those lines that takes forever and you end up dying of hunger in. However, most people are taking their boxes of pizza to go because there isn't much seating available unless you're lucky. So the line moves fast. They have people in the back cooking up the pizzas and putting them in boxes before you know it. Before you finally put your card back in your wallet (only accepts cards if you spend more than $5 and honestly, please do) you should have a box of pizza ready for you. 

Now why is it so good? Because the ingredients are ridiculously fresh and high in quality. You don't even miss the meat or the sauce. Having those two gone actually makes all the other ingredients truly shine through. When we went we got one with crushed tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, parsley, mozzarella, and Asiago cheese. This place has some of the finest cheeses and it's so melty and golden bubbly. It's fantastic. The crust is thin, crisp and chewy all in one. It honestly doesn't get better. But when you add the hot aioli on it (which you MUST get), it just bumps up the taste even more. I can see why people love the cheeseboard so much and why it'll continue to prosper..8852bfbf0383c34a82ebccf3258212a1
