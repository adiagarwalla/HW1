If you were driving east on I-40 in Amarillo, you might not 
even notice the large group of buildings set back from the road 
or the unfamiliar name Pantex -- but beyond the barbed wire, the 
nations nuclear weapons are being assembled and disassembled largely out of the 
public eye.Its the only facility of its kind in the country -- 
the center of the nuclear weapons universe, as one federal official said 
-- so training a security force to handle any potential threat is 
almost as critical as the work done on the weapons.When the U.S. 
agrees to get rid of part of its nuclear arsenal, it comes 
here. The same holds true for current weapons that need to be 
maintained or refurbished. Contemplate the sheer magnitude of the weapons and nuclear 
material coming through the gates of the facility and you begin to 
get an idea of why security is so important at Pantex.Thats why 
theres a 500-member paramilitary force guarding the plant. These individuals have a 
unique way to 
APDefense Secretary Leon Panetta is seen on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, 
Nov. 15, 2011.ANKARA, Turkey  The U.S. needs to give Libya's leaders 
more time to gain control of the militias that overthrew Muammar Qaddafi 
before determining how to help the fledgling government, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta 
said Friday, a day ahead of his historic visit to Tripoli.While eager 
to encourage a new democracy that emerged from Libya's Arab Spring revolution, 
the U.S. is wary of appearing as trying to exert too much 
influence after an eight-month civil war.At the same time, however, leaders in 
the U.S. and elsewhere worry about how well the newly formed National 
Transitional Council can resolve clashes between militia groups in the North African 
nation."The last thing you want to do is to try to impose 
something on a country that has just gone through what the Libyans 
have gone through," said Panetta, set to become the first U.S. defense 
chief to visit Libya."They

Sytek said they had received Gingrich pre-recorded political phone calls in recent 
days. Both are on the do-not-call list.Gingrich's campaign denied wrongdoing. But the 
issue highlights a larger challenge for Gingrich in New Hampshire and elsewhere.He 
had little organization in early voting states until very recently and scrambled 
to hire staff in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Iowa after his 
poll numbers began to rise. Some staffers have been given great autonomy 
to run state-based campaigns, despite having little experience.Gingrich's New Hampshire director, for 
example, is 29-year-old tea party activist Andrew Hemmingway, who had never worked 
on a campaign before being asked to run Gingrich's operation in the 
state with the nation's first presidential primary on Jan. 10."I understand that 
the Gingrich staff is somewhat young and inexperienced, but the rules are 
the rules," said Foley, wh

Until we have identified every victim, the investigation will continue."Crain, who resigned 
in November, was charged with 23 felony counts, including eight counts of 
manufacturing juvenile pornography, 10 counts of lewd molestation and aggravated possession of 
juvenile pornography. Doby, who was arrested Thursday outside his Bloomsburg, Pa. home, 
was charged with eight counts of manufacturing juvenile pornography and one count 
of conspiracy to manufacture juvenile pornography.Crain and Doby were being held Friday 
on $1 million each. If convicted on all counts, Crain could be 
sentenced to life in prison, while Doby could face up to 170 
years, Smothermon said.Doby was being held in Columbia County Prison near Bloomsburg 
University, the state-owned school about 90 miles northwest of Philadelphia from which 
he retired in 2008. Pennsylvania court officials said Friday they have no

 WASHINGTON  Congress would impose restrictions on aid to Egypt, Pakistan and 
the Palestinian Authority in a $53.3 billion bill that avoids deep cuts 
in foreign assistance and State Department funding that Republicans had pursued this 
year.The legislation is part of a sweeping, $1 trillion-plus year-end spending package 
that provides money for 10 Cabinet agencies through next September. The House 
was expected to pass the measure on Friday and the Senate sometime 
this weekend.Foreign aid amounts to just 1 percent of the federal budget, 
but lawmakers intent on cutting the deficit, especially conservative tea party Republicans, 
have clamored for significant ctions in spending overseas. Democrats and the State 
Department, led by Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, successfully pressed to spare the 
accounts.The legislation would provide $53.3 billion for foreign assistance and the State 
Department -- $42.1 billion for the base budget and $11.2 billion for

two-month extension would have to include the Keystone language.The pre-Christmas wrangling caps 
a contentious year in a capital hindered by divided government, with Democrats 
controlling the White House and the Senate and Republicans run the House. 
Lawmakers have engaged in down-to-the-wire drama even when performing the most mundane 
acts of governing, such as keeping agencies functioning and extending federal borrowing 
authority, tasks that are only becoming more politically delicate as the calendar 
nears the 2012 election year.Fox News' Trish Turner and The Associated Press 
contributed to this report.
