ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
"high intensity field inspection." It said an autopsy was done on Dec. 
18 and "fully confirmed" the diagnosis.
ing a trip to Austria.Kim rarely traveled abroad and then only by 
train because of an alleged fear of flying, once heading all the 
way by luxury rail car to Moscow, indulging in his taste for 
fine food along the way.One account of Kim's lavish lifestyle came from 
Konstantin Pulikovsky, a former Russian presidential envoy who wrote the book "The 
Orient Express" about Kim's train trip through Russia in July and August 
2001.Pulikovsky, who accompanied the North Korean leader, said Kim's 16-car private train 
was stocked with crates of French wine. Live lobsters were delivered in 
advance to stations.A Japanese cook later claimed he was Kim's personal sushi 
chef for a decade, writing that Kim had a wine cellar stocked 
with 10,000 bottles, and that, besides sushi, Kim ate shark's fin soup 
-- a rare delicacy -- weekly."His banquets often started at midnight and 
lasted until morning. The longest lasted for four days," the chef, who 
goes by the pseudonym Kenji Fujimoto,

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rnment's Office of Civil Defense.In Iligan, a coastal industrial hub of 330,000 
people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died 
in Cagayan de Oro, most of them 
 State governments across the country have cut more than 80,000 jobs since 
the beginning of the recession, reflecting steep drops in tax revenue and 
providing a drag on the economies in many parts of the country, 
the Associated Press has found.Data collected by AP reporters in all 50 
states show the number of government employees has declined along with per-capita 
general fund spending. The national average of state employees per 1,000 people 
has dropped from 8.1 to 7.6, thanks to layoffs and hiring freezes 
since the 2007-08 budget year.State workers have been at the center of 
some of the most heated debates this year over the appropriate size 
and scope of government. Those debates will resume in 2012, especially as 
many states continue to struggle with budget deficits and seek to reform 
public pension benefits.General fund spending has rebounded beyond pre-recession levels in 24 
states, but the remaining 26 are still a collective $42 billion lower 
compared wit
from venture capitalists and other investors. Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said in 
September that cash cushion would allow the company to control its own 
destiny -- and for now avoid selling its stock through an initial 
public offering.By limiting its shareholders to a small group of private investors, 
Twitter doesn't have to disclose how much revenue it brings in. The 
research firm eMarketer estimates Twitter will generate close to $140 million in 
ad revenue this year and $260 million in 2012.
