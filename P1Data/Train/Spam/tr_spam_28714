                  Dear Reader,<br><br>
                  Have you heard about the latest Obama tax? It's about to increase everyone's expenses in a big way in 2014.<br><br>
                  It could cost ordinary folks anywhere from $200 to $400 per month. In some cases even a lot more, depending on your tax status.<br><br>
                  Will you have to pay it? And is there a way out of this outrageous tax hike?<br><br><a href="http://smithnwes.info/1c82581cac443f506ee5c024b097_c792ad54-010102020001/C/g=yxoqc/g=hos/q=1CB911C6/5028">The full breakdown is here</a>. Please give this a look. I believe it will save a lot of people a good deal of money in 2014 - and in years to come.<br><br>
                  Sincerely,<br><br><img border="0"  src="http://smithnwes.info/images/0113_MikeWard_sig.png" width="166" alt=""><br><br>

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.07.—A Box of Chestnuts.

Shell 1 qt. of chestnuts and cover with boiling water; leave them for fifteen minutes, then rub off the brown skins. Put them into[Pg 17] a saucepan, cover them with soup stock and let them boil ½ an hour; when done, drain. Save the stock. Into a frying pan put 1 tablespoonful of butter and when melted add 1 of flour; cook until browned, then add the stock and stir until it boils; add salt and pepper to taste. Lay the chestnuts in a box made of fried bread and pour the sauce over.

To make the box, take a loaf of bread, cut off the crust and leave the sides as smooth as possible. Cut out the centre, leaving a box shaped piece. Fry this in deep fat.
8.—Curried Hare.

Clean and cut the hare or rabbit as for fricassee. Simmer slowly in just enough water to cover, add a thickening of 1 tablespoonful each of butter and flour, season with salt, pepper, and 1 tablespoonful of curry powder.
9.—Scrambled Eggs with Shad Roes.

When you have shad for dinner scald the roes ten minutes in boiling water (salted), drain, throw into cold water, leave them there three minutes, wipe dry, and set in a cold place until you wish to use them. Cut[Pg 18] them across into pieces an inch or more wide, roll them in flour, and fry to a fine brown. Scramble a dish of eggs, pile the roes in the centre of a heated platter, and dispose the eggs in a sort of hedge all around them.—From "The National Cook Book," by Marion Harland and Christine Terhune Herrick.
10.—Chicken in Celery Sauce.

Take the roots of a bunch of celery, clean and cut it into small pieces, put them into a saucepan and cover with cold water, about a pint, stew slowly and when tender put through a vegetable press. Into a saucepan put 1 tablespoonful each of flour and butter. When melted and rubbed smooth add ½ a cup of milk and the celery. Stir well and when it boils add salt and pepper. Have 1 pt. of cold chicken cut into dice, and add them to the boiling sauce when all is hot. Serve with toast points.
11.—Fig Ice Cream.

Put 3½ cupfuls of milk in a double boiler and as soon as it comes to a boil stir in two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch that has been[Pg 19] mixed with ½ a cupful of cold milk. Cook for ten minutes. Beat together 3 eggs and a cup and a half of sugar. Pour the cooked corn-starch and milk on this, stirring all the time. Put back again on the fire, and add 1 tablespoonful of gelatine which has been dissolved in 4 tablespoonfuls of cold water. Cook three minutes. Set away to cool. When cold add 1 pt. of cream and 1 tablespoonful of vanilla and freeze. When the mixture has been freezing for ten minutes, take off the cover and add 2 cupfuls of chopped figs. Cover again and freeze hard.
12.—Souffle Biscuit.

Rub 4 ozs. of butter with a qt. of wheat flour, add a little salt. Make it into a paste with ½ a pt. of milk. Knead it well: roll it as thin as paper. Cut it out with a tumbler, and bake brown.
13.—Fish Chowder.

Put ¼ of a lb. of bacon into a frying pan with 1 onion sliced; fry a light brown. Into a saucepan put a layer of potatoes, a layer of fish, then a few slices of the onion and bacon, then season. Continue until all has[Pg 20] been used. Add 1 qt. of water, cover and let simmer 20 minutes without stirring. In a double boiler put 1 pt. of milk and break into it 6 water crackers; let it stand a few minutes then add to the chowder. Let it boil up once and serve. Use 3 lbs. of chopped fish and 3 potatoes for this.
14.—Cold Duck and Chestnut-Border.

Arrange slices of cold duck on a platter. Shell and blanch 1 qt. of chestnuts, then boil until soft, drain and put them through a colander. Add a tablespoonful of butter, salt and pepper to taste, arrange around the cold duck. Garnish with olives or bits of red currant jelly.
15.—Oysters with Madeira Sauce.

Into a saucepan put 2 tablespoonfuls of butter and 1 of flour, ½ a cup of milk, a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne. Stir until smooth, then add 25 oysters that have been washed and drained. When cooked take from the stove and add 2 tablespoonfuls of Madeira wine.
16.—Chicken Fritters.

Season well, pieces of cold roast chicken.[Pg 21] Make a fritter batter, stir the pieces in. Drop by spoonfuls into boiling fat. Lemon juice added to the seasoning is an improvement.
