Rachael dropped 25lbs. You can too when you request your sample by 1-7-15, here

Fast forward to this afternoon and I discovered our garbage disposal wasn't working.  I remembered Michael from the previous task, so I emailed him.  5410828 I wasn't expecting him to message me back until the following day since it was after 5pm, but he called me back within minutes of sending the email!  He told me he knew what the problem was from my explanation and could instruct me on how to fix the issue over the phone since it was a quick and easy fix.  5410828 He could have easily came to my home and charged an hourly fee, but he didn't because he is quite a sincere and upstanding guy!  Anyway, he was right on target about the problem with our disposal and I was able to fix the issue within minutes of our phone conversation.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Michael is very quick to respond to phone calls and email, which puts him a step ahead of the competition. He asked me to send him a list of the jobs, and I sent him a dream list of everything 5410828 I wanted done right then, which ran the gamut from having a new house number sign hung, to repairing some broken pieces on my stoops and resealing them, to putting a shelf in my laundry room. He asked for some pictures, which I sent.

And then proceeded to tell me that he was unable to help with virtually any item on my list. The bigger stuff, I understand: 5410828 I may need a real contractor to do things like replace part of my kitchen counter, and I can understand his not wanting to undertake resealing my front and back steps or restaining my front door.

But as an example, one job was to remove old house numbers, fill the nail-holes left by the old numbers, and hang a new house number sign. Though his website says he will do paint touch-ups, he told me I would have to hire a painter to fill the nail-holes and touch up the paint. 1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc He also told me I needed to hire a painter to paint a small piece of wood that had been replaced on the door trim. I ended up doing both these jobs myself in less than ten minutes, but I figured I would include them on the punch list since, if a handyman is already there and I already have the paint, no big deal to knock those things out as well, right? Apparently, wrong.

Here are the things Michael 5410828 told me he could not do: replace the undercabinet lighting in my kitchen, put a shelf on top of my washer/dryer in the laundry room (basically I just need a board fitted to the space and laid on top of the machines - he said I need to hire a counter specialist for that), repair and refinish my stoops, find a replacement for a broken vent cover and stain it to match the floor, fix the crack in my front door and stain the door, source and replace a new section of kitchen counter (including possible adding additional bracing and support).

In the end, 5410828 I'm not entirely sure what Michael DOES do. Just light plumbing, hanging pictures, and putting together Ikea furniture, maybe? From my list, the only things he said he would do were hanging a new house number sign (but not patching the nail-holes from the old one) and replacing some door hardware.1a7312398dd320feef73bcb599005ffc
