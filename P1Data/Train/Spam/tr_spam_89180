Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows, the second installment in the series, 
churns like a lump of moldy dough sitting in the pit of 
your stomach, trying ever so hard to be digested.ction: Sherlock Holmes return 
is a highly stylized, amplified cacophony of dreck.Guy Ritchies first Sherlock Holmes 
was a feast for the eyes and mind, with intelligent plot lines, 
semi-layered characters and fine acting. There was a sense of pride in 
taking on the worlds greatest detective.But all that was successful before is 
absent from this overblown, nonsensical sequel. The film is so dull it 
kills the desire to ever go back and rewatch the original.The crime 
committed here? A dumb screenplay. Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law, both 
terrific actors, are not to blame. Theyre just victims to the lack 
of substance they have to work with. The pair deliver empty dialogue, 
tell stale jokes and run amok trying to save Europe from inevitable 
war.But unlike the original, who cares?Holmes
e water that has collected in the reactor basements and nearby storage 
areas. Officials, including nuclear and environment minister Goshi Hosono, admitted the possibility 
of mechanical glitches, water leaks or other unexpected troubles down the road, 
but said ample protection is now in place to avert another disaster.TEPCO 
President Toshio Nishizawa apologized for the accident, and vowed to further stabilize 
the plant and ce its radiation release until it is finally closed.Akira 
Yamaguchi, a nuclear physicist at Osaka University, said the government's definition of 
cold shutdown is disputable."But what's most important right now is that there 
aren't any massive radiation leaks any more," he said.Putting longer-term issues aside, 
he warned that much of the backup equipment installed at the plant 
since the crisis began is makeshift and may break down. He said

more toys are needed for older children, including books and games.For people 
who are doing well this year, "it's up to us to dig 
deep and to make sure we take care of our neighbors out 
there who may be struggling," she said.Organizers said the toys will be 
distributed to needy children in the Washington area.Obama said her daughter Malia 
was impressed to learn that Toys for Tots was started by the 
Marines."You all have given so much to our country, as Malia has 
recognized, and you just keep giving more," Obama said.Retired Marine Gen. Pete 
Osman, president and CEO of Quantico, Va.-based Toys for Tots, said Obama 
is their "No. 1 volunteer," and he called her commitment to military 
families "incredible.""It sends a big signal to the military," he said of 
Obama's support. "When you've got someone like the first lady behind you, 
how can you go wrong?"The charity's challenge this year, though, is rising

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">LINCOLN, Neb.  The chief executive of a company trying to build 
a pipeline to carry oil through six states from Canada to Texas 
said the national debate over the plan has "gone off on tangents" 
that touch on larger issues of U.S. energy and environmental policies.TransCanada CEO 
Russ Girling said the proposed 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline has become mired 
in debates over topics ranging from global warming to U.S. presidential politics. 
The U.S. State Department delayed the $7 billion project last month largely 
because of concerns about its route, particularly though environmentally sensitive areas in 
Nebraska."It's mushroomed into this debate about all these social issues, which I 
don't deny we have to address," Girling said in a telephone interview 
with The Associated Press from his office in Calgary."We're obviously in a 
migration from fossil fuels to alternative energy, which is why we've invested 
in the largest wind farm in Canada and one of the largest 

 ORLANDO, Fla.  An Orlando millionaire developer has been sentenced to 30 
years in prison for killing his wife.Bob Ward was given the sentence 
Friday during a hearing. The minimum sentence the 63-year-old Ward was eligible 
for was 25 years, and the maximum was life in prison.Judge Jenifer 
Davis denied Ward's request for an acquittal or a new trial. His 
attorney says Ward is filing an appeal.Ward's attorneys say jurors wrongly conducted 
an experiment with a gun in the jury room and that prosecutors 
made statements about Ward's demeanor that shouldn't have been allowed during the 
trial.Ward was convicted of second-degree murder in September. Prosecutors say he shot 
his wife, Diane, in the bedroom of their mansion in the Orlando 
suburb of Isleworth.
AP Dec. 15: Dona, Matt, left, and Bryce Bremser, sit for photos 
at their Omaha, Neb., home. The Bremsers had their layaway at Kmart 
paid off by an unknown good Samaritan.OMAHA, NEBRASKA-- The young father stood 
in line at the Kmart layaway counter, wearing dirty clothes and worn-out 
boots. With him were three small children.He asked to pay something on 
his bill because he knew he wouldn't be able to afford it 
all before Christmas. Then a mysterious woman stepped up to the counter."She 
told him, 'No, I'm paying for it,'" recalled Edna Deppe, assistant manager 
at the store in Indianapolis. "He just stood there and looked at 
her and then looked at me and asked if it was a 
joke. I told him it wasn't, and that she was going to 
pay for him. And he just busted out in tears."At Kmart stores 
across the country, Santa seems to be getting some help: Anonymous donors 
are paying off strangers' layaway accounts, buying the Christmas gifts other families 
couldn't afford, e
