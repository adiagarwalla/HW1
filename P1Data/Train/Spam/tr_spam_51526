 across western Iowa.The leaders of the pack, former House Speaker Newt 
Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan. 
3 caucuses -- started Friday to make a play for South Carolina 
voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for 
any GOP presidential nominee.Gingrich, a southerner himself, has been dominating the polls 
in the Palmett
ists and dieticians on call whenever a celebrity wants, and whenever a 
celebrity needs it.Mariah Carey and Jessica Simpson are the latest celebrities cashing 
in on gaining and losing weight while millions of Americans pay for 
the privilege. Carey signed on with the Jenny Craig weight loss company 
for an undisclosed sum, while Simpson was paid a reported $3 million 
by Weight Watchers before she even had her baby (due in early 
2012).FOX411: Carey Shows Off Post Baby Body.A spokesperson for Jenny Craig said 
their celebrities, including Mariah Carey, receive no preferential treatment.Our Brand Ambassadors experience 
the same Jenny program as any of our other clients, including a 
weekly one-on-one consultation with their personal consultant, either in person or over 
the phone.No special treatment is provided, a rep told Fox411.com.Weight Watchers declined 
to comment.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Jenny Craig and Carey are promoting the singers 
30 pound weight loss since st
hen you deal with something so real and so heavy, with people 
who really lived through this and lost family members, it is so 
painful and real that it brings out a lot of kindness and 
love, Jolie explained.Although shes only now beginning to soak in the success 
of what she has managed to accomplish, the movie  from start 
to finish  seems to have spiraled from one headache to another 
for its world-famous screen siren. Firstly, Jolie was refused access to sound 
stages and studio sets owned by Serbian tycoon and media magnate eljko 
Mitrovi; a Bosnian official canceled the productions filming permit citing incomplete paperwork; 
and last week Croatian author James Braddock filed a plagiarism lawsuit against 
Jolie, alleging that the star stole the idea from a book he 
published in 2007.This week, Branislav Djukic of the Bosnian Serb Association of 
Camp Prisoners has called for a ban on Blood and Honey in 
the Serbian-run part of the country. Djukic told the Associated

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Nicole Scherzinger (Reuters)MEXICO CITY  Nicole Scherzinger recently was held up at 
gunpoint by a gang in Mexico, RadarOnline reported Thursday.The US "X Factor" 
judge and the show's choreographer, Brian Friedman, were driving in the country 
during a trip to shoot her video "Try with Me" when they 
were pulled over by gunmen, Friedman told Star magazine."We were held at 
gunpoint," he said. "People next to our cars  there were M16s 
and Berettas."HOT SHOTS: Nicole ScherzingerThe 33-year-old former Pussycat Doll and the choreographer 
eventually were released unharmed by the local gang."Nicole cursed me with this 
trip," Friedman added. "It was the craziest adventure ever."
 Tom Cruise is back with the slickest adventure-travel guide of the year: 
Mission: Impossible  Ghost Protocol. Boasting an exotic trip around the world, 
an engaging script, funny dialogue and spectacular stunts, Ghost Protocol is an 
adrenaline-rush adventure on a grand scale.The latest installment in the "Mission: Impossible" 
franchise forces Ethan Hunt and his team to go rogue after being 
framed for bombing the Kremlin. To clear their names they travel from 
Russia to Dubai to Mumbai tracking the maniacal Russian heavy whos intent 
on instigating global nuclear war.Ghost Protocol has a healthy mix of stealthy 
intrigue and urgency, combining the successful espionage elements of the original with 
a frenetic larger-than-life adventure featuring several jaw-dropping set pieces. The highlight is 
a breathtaking spider crawl up Dubais Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in 
the world.Bravo to Cruise for doing his own stunts.Along for the ride 
again is Simon Pegg as Benji, 
ounter -- from when he first entered the locker room to when 
he retreated to his office -- lasted about 45 seconds.McQueary said he 
reported what he saw to Paterno but never went to police.He said 
he did not give Paterno explicit details of what he believed he'd 
seen, saying he wouldn't have used terms like sodomy or anal intercourse 
out of respect for the longtime coach.Paterno told the grand jury that 
McQueary reported seeing Sandusky doing something of a "sexual nature" with the 
youngster but that he didn't press for details."I didn't push Mike ... 
because he was very upset," Paterno said. "I knew Mike was upset, 
and I knew some kind of inappropriate action was being taken by 
Jerry Sandusky with a youngster."McQueary said Paterno told him he'd "done the 
right thing" by reporting the encounter. The head coach appeared shocked and 
saddened and slumped back in his chair, McQueary said.Paterno told McQueary he 
would talk to others about what he'd reported.Nine
