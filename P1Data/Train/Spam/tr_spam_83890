, the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha
Two Wisconsin sisters have reportedly been charged with sexually assaulting a man 
with pliers and forced him to drink urine.Valerie Bartkey, 24, and Amanda 
Johnson, 17, of Somerset, Wis., have each been charged with a felony 
count of second-degree assault by force and misdemeanor counts of battery and 
criminal damage to property, TwinCities.com reports.According to court records, an 18-year-old man 
told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report

New York Police DepartmentJanuary 31, 2012: Scene of raid on Bronx building 
that contained 600 marijuana plants.NEW YORK  Cops raided a New York 
apartment building Tuesday and found it had been turned into a pot 
farm.Acting on a tip, police broke down the door at 610 Morris 
Park Avenue in The Bronx at 1:00 p.m. local time and discovered 
a staggering 600 marijuana-growing pots. They filled the top four floors of 
the five-story building.Officials estimated there was 1,500 pounds of pot growing in 
the building, and at $5,000 a pound, it had a street value 
of about $7.5 million.Cops also found there had modifications to the ventilation 
of the building and other changes."It was like a pot farm in 
there," one law enforcement source said. "They were using enough electricity, grow 
lights and such to power an entire city block."Three suspects in their 
20s were arrested on drug dealing and drug possession charges.Click for more

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ifornia solar company that received a $528 million federal loan and then 
later declared bankruptcy, prompting a federal investigation. Steve Spinner, an Energy Department 
adviser, raised at least $500,000 and Steve Westly, a venture capitalist who 
was an unpaid adviser to the department, raised between $200,000 and $500,000.The 
disclosure came as Obama headed back out on the money trail, speaking 
Tuesday night at two high-dollar fundraisers in the Washington area where donors 
paid $35,800 per ticket to see him. At an event at the 
posh St. Regis Hotel, the president told donors that Republicans have "the 
wrong vision for America," though he didn't mention any of his opponents 
by name or reference the voting under way in Florida, where polls 
were closing in the state's GOP primary.Obama said voters needed to know 
"that this is not an abstract ideological argument, that this is a 
practical concrete argument," and that the election is about whether they'll be

  false analogy.""It is time for the international community to put aside 
our own differences and send a clear message of support to the 
people of Syria," Clinton said.Russia has stood by Assad as he tries 
to crush an uprising that began last March. In October, Moscow vetoed 
the first Security Council attempt to condemn Syria's crackdown and has shown 
little sign of budging in its rejection of the new measure.The latest 
resolution would demand Assad carry out an Arab League peace plan by 
which he would hand his powers to the vice president and allow 
formation of a unity government to pave the way for elections.On Wednesday, 
shelling and machine gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, 
a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus near 
the Lebanese border, according to online video posted by activists.The valley leads 
to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has 
been under the control of rebel soldiers and pro
hs before. The Florida unemployment rate last month was 9.9 percent, the 
first time it was out of double digits in a crushing 31 
months, and is still worse than all but four states.The reason is 
that ever since Mr. Flagler built his railroad to Miami in 1896, 
the Sunshine States economy has been heavily dependent on real estate. While 
the bursting of the real estate bubble in 2008 hurt the whole 
country and trashed every 401(k), Florida went straight from boom to bust. 
Not only did depressed housing prices mean that the market for flips 
and swaps dried up, but the pool of ready cash and debt 
to finance development, second homes and the sunbelt retirement dreams of snowbirds 
was gone too.After nearly a century of growth, sometimes stratospheric, Florida is 
lagging the nation.Since January 2008, Florida has consistently been among the worst 
in America for foreclosures. There were warning signs even then, with a 
big jump in foreclosures from the year before. Thi
