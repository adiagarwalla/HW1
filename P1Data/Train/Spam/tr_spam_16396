Simon Dunford, a spokesman for Jones Climatic Research Unit, told FoxNews.com that 
Jones has changed his tune since the emails were made public."Prof Jones 
has already accepted he should have been more open, and has since 
made all the station data referred to in these emails publicly available," 
Dunford told FoxNews.com.Watts said that while much of the data itself is 
now available, the methods of adjusting it -- statistical modification meant to 
filter anomalies, "normalize" the data, and potentially highlight certain trends -- remain 
a secret."Much of climate science, in terms of the computer processing that

the data go in, and we see the data that come out 
as a finished product -- but we dont know how they adjust 
it in between.Watts said he would li

a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in

daily news briefing at the White House.Senate leaders reached a tentative agreement 
Friday night on legislation to extend Social Security payroll tax cuts and 
jobless benefits for two months while requiring President Barack Obama to accept 
Republican demands for a swift decision on the fate of an oil
