Please note the glass door on the 13th has been repaired and a badge is required for entry.  Also note that the freight elevator doors on our floor should always be closed/locked at all times.  If these doors are open, this allows easy access to our floor.  

If you have any questions, please call me at x33597.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
