April,


My plans are to visit your office the week of July 30th.  We have 20 people that need to be migrated. I would like to migrate 10 people on Monday and 10 people on Tuesday. Migrations are done at night, therefore, Tuesday and Wednesday morning I will  configure everyone's Outlook.  The rest of the time I'll be training everyone and setting everything up to best fit people's needs. 
 
A copy of the NA Email Retention / Policy is attached. 

 
However, due to legal issues we are currently experiencing with the San Francisco office, this will not go into affect yet. We will not purge anyone's Lotus Notes mailboxes. Notes will be available to you for referencing. 

Only 30 days worth of information will be transferred from Notes to Outlook.  Once on Outlook, we will still hold off on purging. 
Nevertheless, when the legal issues clear, we will reinforce our policy. 


Thank you for your time,

Wilma Bleshman
