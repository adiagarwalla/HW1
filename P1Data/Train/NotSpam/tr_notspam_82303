Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes Deal # Price    Period  Global No.
Suemaur Explor & Prod  9881   1300mmbtu/d 709716 100% GD less $0.10  
3/22-3/31 96058314

MSLATX P/L Company  9880   2000mmbtu/d 709721 100% GD less $0.25  3/27-3/31 
96058031

 
FYI, I have created and submitted a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,

vlt
