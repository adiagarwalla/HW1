Attached is a file containing ClickPaper approvals and amendments for January 
4, 2001.  Most of the amendments reflect the fact that these counterparties 
are current customers of Garden State Paper and to whom RAC will allocate a 
default credit limit of $100,000 barring credit information that would 
dictate a higher amount.  Please call if you have any questions; thanks.

Walter
