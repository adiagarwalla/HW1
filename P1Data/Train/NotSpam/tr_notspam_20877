Based on my discussions with Sally, and her discussions with Ted and Rick 
Carson, I've updated the process flows for Doorstep teams.  I've defined the 
roles and responsibilities for each group as well, which were not included in 
the original draft.  Please call me if you have any questions.

Best regards

Shona
