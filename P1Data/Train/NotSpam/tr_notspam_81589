Team,

Attached is a very rough draft of a book to be put together describing the 
potential Crescendo purchase of the Wildhorse South Gathering System.  There 
are still a lot of holes, and I would appreciate you adding your knowledge to 
improve it.

Please call me with your suggestions.

Thanks,
Mark
