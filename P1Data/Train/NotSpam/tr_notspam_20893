Phillip,

Courtney needs me to watch the boys on Thursday in order to get organized 
before we leave for Italy.  I can be reached on my cell phone 713-408-6256.  
Please have Anne update the newcurrentday sheet in order to manage my 
position.  Please call me with any pertinent market information.  I will see 
you Friday.  Thanks for the help.

Thanks,
Mike
