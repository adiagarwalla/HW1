Some questions about the 1st.

Per the proxy, we should be injecting 26,219 dt/day into storage.  You are 
showing 36,304 dt/day on the FOM sheet.  AND I see a citygate load of 29,461 
dt/day.

This morning Tim Ray sold Dick 23,060 dt/day at the pool.  Is this to reduce 
the citygate load or is this additional New Power supply?
