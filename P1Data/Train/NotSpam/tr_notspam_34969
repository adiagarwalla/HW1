Subject: SCE Plans to Implement billing and balancing account aspects of MOU 
as of June 3

I learned at the AReM meeting today:

SCE has informed ESPs that it will implement its advice letter on the MOU 
(don't recall the number) beginning with the new rates on June 3.  We are 
planning to protest that AL.  Do we care? IF we do, Jeanne, can we stop them?

Also, SCE has informed people that it is calculating the PX Charge/Credit 
based on its AL that was rejected by the CPUC. Do we care on that one?
