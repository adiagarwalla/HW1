Attached you will find the brief we filed yesterday in the UC-CSU matter and 
the declarations of several Enron people and an expert supporting our 
positions.  The filing yesterday was only to oppose the universities' request 
to shorten the briefing and hearing schedule on their motion for a 
preliminary injunction.  Next step will be to file our opposition to the 
motion for preliminary injunction, and the date for filing those documents 
will be set by the court.  Please let us know if you have any questions.
