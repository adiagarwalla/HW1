Dear Friends,
A friend of mine sent me this message.  The news of their friends is so
tragically sad.  Being a mother of 2 (almost 3) makes me ache for their
family even more!  I would feel so desperate in the quest to save my
children, as they are feeling.  Please read it and pass it on to your local
friends, co-workers or family who might be comfortable with their request.
Please include them in your prayers.
Thanks and God Bless!
Robyn
