Thank you all for making a pledge for the Cystic Fibrosis Great Strides 
Walk.  I will be collecting the pledges through next Friday, May 18.  Checks 
should be payable to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and I can accept cash 
donations as well.  I will take care of the matching funds form for the total 
of the contributions.

Your thoughtfulness in contributing to this foundation gives families like 
mine much hope for the future of these precious children.

Many thanks,
Laurie
