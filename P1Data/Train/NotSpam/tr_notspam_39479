		 Subject: Hearings

These committees will all meet on Monday at 1:30 p.m. to hear the
following bills.  I have included brief descriptions.  The bills are
however subject to change.

Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability

ABX1 9 (2001-2002), Richman: ASM
Digest Summary: Under existing law, the State Energy Resources
Conservation and Development Commission has various powers and duties
with respect to the siting of thermal powerplants, as defined, in the
state.
This bill would require the commission, at the earliest possible time,
to identify the 10 counties in the state with the highest total
population and electricity demand for the 10 years preceding January 1,
2001, and, after completing that identification of counties, to allocate
a total of 20 sites that are distributed throughout those identified
counties to be used as a location for a 1000 megawatt thermal powerplant
and related facilities, as provided.

ABX1 13 (2001-2002), Firebaugh: ASM
Digest Summary:Existing law requires the Public Utilities Commission to
establish a program of assistance to low-income electric and gas
customers, which is referred to as the California Alternate Rates for
Energy or CARE program.
This bill would establish the Low-Income Oversight Board for the purpose
of monitoring and evaluating the implementation of low-income programs.

ABX1 25 (2001-2002), Runner: ASM
Digest Summary:Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school
district that determines during a fiscal year that its revenues are less
than the amount necessary to meet its current year expenditure
obligations to request an emergency apportionment through the
Superintendent of Public Instruction subject to requirements and
repayment provisions.
This bill would establish the Interruptible Program Contingency
Revolving Loan Fund, appropriated to and administered by the State
Department of Education, to provide loans to school districts, community
college districts, and private postsecondary educational institutions
for the purpose of paying unexpected energy costs.

ABX1 26 (2001-2002), Leach: ASM
Digest Summary:Existing law authorizes the governing board of a school
district that determines during a fiscal year that its revenues are less
than the amount necessary to meet its current year expenditure
obligations to request an emergency apportionment through the
Superintendent of Public Instruction subject to requirements and
repayment provisions.
This bill would establish the continuously appropriated School Energy
Contingency Revolving Loan Fund to provide loans, to the extent that
funds are transferred to the fund and according to specified priorities,
to school districts and charter schools for the purpose of paying
unexpected energy costs.

ABX1 38 (2001-2002), Jackson: ASM
Digest Summary: Existing law establishes the California Alternative
Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority and prescribes
the duties of the authority with respect to, among other things,
promoting prompt and efficient development of energy sources that are
renewable or that more efficiently utilize and conserve scarce energy
resources.
The bill would appropriate $150,000,000 from the General Fund to the
authority for a program to create loan guarantees to underwrite joint
venture agreements between public power entities, independent
generators, and utilities for specified purposes.

Assembly Natural Resources:

ABX1 31 (2001-2002), Wright: ASM
Digest Summary: Existing law authorizes any person to petition the
hearing board of an air pollution control district or air quality
management district for a variance from the rules, regulations, or
orders of the district.
This bill would provide that a breakdown condition includes, but is not
limited to, the startup or shutdown of a facility that has complied with
applicable startup and shutdown procedures, or a failure to operate air
emission control equipment, if either condition is caused by a power
interruption or curtailment initiated by the Independent System
Operator, a public utility electrical corporation, or local publicly
owned electric utility, as defined.

ABX1 34 (2001-2002), La Suer: ASM
Digest Summary: The Warren-Alquist State Energy Resources Conservation
and Development Act authorizes the State Energy Resources Conservation
and Development Commission, upon a declaration by the Governor or by an
act of the Legislature that a threat to public health, safety, and
welfare exists and requires immediate action, to determine that all
reasonable conservation, allocation, and service restriction measures
may not alleviate any energy supply emergency, and to authorize the
construction and use of generating facilities under the terms and
conditions as specified by the commission to protect the public
interest.
This bill would make a legislative declaration that a threat to the
public health, safety, and welfare exists that requires immediate action
and that all reasonable conservation, allocation, and service
restriction measures have not alleviated the energy supply emergency.

ACRX1 2 (2001-2002), Cogdill: ASM
Digest Summary:This measure would urge the Governor of California to
expand the current declaration of emergency in California and to exert
his emergency power authority to increase the production of electricity
in California and order the Public Utilities Commission to meet in an
emergency session to enact a comprehensive regulation allowing for
forward and bilateral contracting of energy purchases without a
reasonableness review of the contracts.

Senate Natural Resources

SBX1 28 (2001-2002), Sher: SEN
Digest Summary: Existing law contains various provisions relative to air
pollution control.
This bill would require the State Air Resources Board, in consultation
with air districts and the State Energy Resources Conservation and
Development Commission, to implement a program for the expedited
retrofit of electrical generating facilities to ensure that the
facilities are permitted to operate in a manner that complies with law.
