       The Sad State of Our Military


I sat, as millions of other Americans and watched
as our government underwent a peaceful transition
of power January 2001.

At first, I felt a swell of pride and patriotism as

I watched George W. Bush take his oath of office.

However, all that pride vanished as I watched
William Jefferson Clinton board Air Force One
for the final time.

I saw 21 US Marines in full dress, with rifles, fire
a 21 gun salute to the outgoing president.

It was then that I realized how far America's
military deteriorated. Every last one of them
missed!!!!!!
