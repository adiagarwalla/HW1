ENA entered into a purchase and sale agreement today to sell 80% of our Monterrey Project to Tractebel.  It is anticipated that it will take 60-90 days to get IDB and CFC approval, and have targeted a mid-August closing.  Some of you may be aware that Tractebel attempted to add a new CP at the last minute (last Monday).  We did not accept the CP but rather crafted another solution (thanks Maria Elena) of no real value to Enron but with optical value to Tractebel.

I will keep you all up to date as this transaction progresses.

Thanks,

Don
