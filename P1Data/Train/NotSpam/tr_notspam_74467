I know nothing about the purchase but I do know that Derek Davies and Michael 
Law are thinking about engaging in a transaction with Daishowa.  Don't think 
it is related but they may know something about this.

Subject: Daishowa

I got a call from National Bank of Canada and they said that we purchased the 
referenced company and what did we intend to do with the trade between NBC 
and Daishowa?  Anyone know anything about this?
