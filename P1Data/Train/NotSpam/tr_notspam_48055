I am currently scheduled to be on vacation from December 21 through January 
1.  I will be checking my voicemail, and you can page me anytime at 
800-901-3314. For the Phase IV and V Teams, we will have our last staff 
meeting for the year on December 18.  Our first staff meeting in 2001 will be 
on Tuesday, January 2.  Thanks!

Rock Meyer
