Subject: Party Update....he wants to play golf


Talked to Gary this morning...

We need a head count...

We are planning to have a golf outing the day of the party...so I need to
know if you are going to play golf, play golf and party or just party....

Please respond as soon as possible so we can make sure Gary has the time of
his life!!

thanks,

Jeff
