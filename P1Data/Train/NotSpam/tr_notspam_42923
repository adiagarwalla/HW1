 John Sherriff and I are recommending Carol Hensley (VP Marketing and=20
Communications at Azurix) for a VP position in John=01,s organization.  Car=
ol=20
was a director in the Enron PR group before moving to Azurix.  Her new role=
=20
would be to support EnronCredit.com.  A critical success factor for=20
EnronCredit.com will be to establish a strong brand in the coming months.

 In her time at Azurix, Carol has added significantly to her skills and=20
experience.  I spoke with John Garrison at length about Carol=01,s performa=
nce=20
at Azurix.  She has expanded her marketing services skills and provided=20
significant support in the investor relations arena.  Garrison relates that=
=20
the Azurix commercial leaders view Carol as a partner, informed about the=
=20
business and instrumental in handling crises and pursuing business=20
opportunities.

 John Sherriff and Ken Lay join me in recommending that Carol keep her VP=
=20
title as she returns to Enron. =20

 A copy of Carol's resume is attached.
