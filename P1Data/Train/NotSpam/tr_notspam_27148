Mary, I am working with Jeff Golden and Marc Pana in EES Corporate 
Development. Marc asked me to send you a list of potential substations for 
interconnection of mobile generation in blocks of 25 MW to 50 MW. Here is a 
tentative list. Please feel free to suggest any other location you think is 
suitable for trading power in Palo Verde (either directly or with power 
displacement). Thanks for your attention.

Javier.
