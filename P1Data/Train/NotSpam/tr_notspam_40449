Chris,
Most companies send us their fixed-price bidweek data in this format. It's 
more
accurate since we just have to transfer the data instead of retyping 
everything
into our master database. It also saves time on days like today when we have 
to
turn everything over in a day. Anyone with questions can give me a call --
thanks!!
