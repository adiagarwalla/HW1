I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB engineer with SoCal, about a pipeline 
liquids collection SoCal wants to take at our Needles facility.  Ralph said 
that SoCal will be undertaking a study on their pipeline to determine why the 
concentration and liquids volume of PCB's has reduced into their system in 
the past couple of  years (97-2000). I shared with Ralph and up until this 
year, we have not had liquids at the Needles facility since 1994.  He stated 
that they have seen reduced concentrations and are curious as to why this 
trend is occurring (sounds like good news to me).  He said that their data 
shows the following:

 1998 liquids concentrations  only 1% regulated at the federal level

 1999 liquids concentrations only 8% regulated at the federal level

Ralph has requested that SoCal be allowed to collect a  liquids sample at the 
Needles M/S and I have contacted the Needles team about assisting SoCal with 
the collection.

I would expect that this may have implications with respect to slight 
increased billing for analytical charges that SoCal will be charging us for 
and we reveiw on a quarterly basis with them.
