Please review the revised strategy.  Everyone has not been selected as a 
participant yet.  I have been working on logistics.  I was just approved 
today to have the presentation in Stone Davis Hall.  I have also been going 
back and forth with a contact Fariha gave me to set up a faculty lunch and 
classroom presentation.  As confirmations come in, I will update the 
strategy.  I have a meeting with Cindy Olson on September 18, 2000.

We have reserved hotel rooms for the overnight stay events.  Debbie Flores, 
my Coordinator has made those arrangements and will have confirmation 
numbers.  You will be responsible for booking your flight arrangements and 
rental cars in Boston.

If anyone has questions, please leave me a message or e-mail.  I am out on 
the road recruiting at the other schools I am assigned to.



Thanks again, Geynille
