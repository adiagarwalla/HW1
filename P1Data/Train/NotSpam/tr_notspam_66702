Currently, I am receiving exception reporting from many of your groups in 
EXCEL.  We have started to build a database to replace the EXCEL reporting.  
In order to make the reporting easy on you we would like to build the 
database around your current systems.  In order to do this, you and people in 
your groups will be receiving calls from Kelly Tisman, who is responsible for 
building the database.  Please make some time to show her your systems and 
needs as far as the reporting is concerned.

Attached is the list of people she is planning to contact.  If it needs 
updated, please let Kelly know.

Thanks

Shona
