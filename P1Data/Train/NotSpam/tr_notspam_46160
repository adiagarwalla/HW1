Attached is the current version of TW's Firm Capacity Procedures.  (Posting requirements are defined in another document.)  These procedures outline the definitions of certificated/sustainable, operational/short-term sustainable and operational non-sustainable capacity and how we will determine how much and when capacity is available in each of these categories.

I thought I would go ahead and distribute this because there have been some questions - though I understand some of the recent FERC rulings may require us to change the procedures as it concerns, among other things, whether operational/short-term sustainable capacity is sold under LFT vs. daily under FTS-1.
