I am pleased to announce that yesterday (May 3) we closed the sale of the 
Wheatland, Gleason and Lincoln peaker plants to Allegheny. The completion of 
this LONG transaction was truly a team effort!  We are currently planning a 
closing celebration, and I will follow up with the details.

Thanks again for everyone's contribution.

(Sorry for the day delay in the announcement but as you know Outlook was down 
yesterday)
