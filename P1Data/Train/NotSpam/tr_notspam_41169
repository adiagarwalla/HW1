Evaluations are in for the first workshop on Electricity Markets: How Do They 
Work?

What do they say?  An overwhelming majority of participants said the content 
is "just right."  Almost all said they would recommend these workshops to 
others.  And our speakers got high marks.

245 people participated in the workshop, with over 200 of them in their home 
offices participating real time via webcast.

If you haven't done so, sign up for the rest of the series now.  Or sign up 
for the whole series and watch the first workshop via webcast archive.

The next workshop is May 18 when Paul Joskow of MIT will join Catherine 
Wolfram of The University of California, Berkeley to present on "Electricity 
Market Design and Implementation."  Sessions will cover:

? Overview of Wholesale Electricity Generation Markets:
                    Design Objectives and Pricing Principles
? Wholesale Market Design Options and Details
? Operating Reliability and Resource Adequacy
? Financial Markets and Risk Management
