I can't tell by Lotus Notes, is anyone aware of a "credit sleeve" with TMG?

Tana,

I have a favour - Jon McKay of our office is wondering if you have any record 
of a deal with TMG Financial Products Inc. that is a one-off transaction 
dealing with "credit sleeving"?

All we have here is a copy of an ISDA with them - not what he's looking for.

Thanks
Linda
