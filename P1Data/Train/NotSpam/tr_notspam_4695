Hi, Vince:

We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar 
Series in Finance for Fall 2001 and Spring 2002.? Do you have any persons in 
mind that you and your group want to include in the list?? Finance faculty 
will meet to finalize the list later.

Thanks,

Albert

P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?? She is currently in my Enron 
distribution list with email address: rchahal@ess..com.? I have received 
an error message indicating a failure of delivering email to her address.
