By this e-mail I'm requesting that we all meet on Wednesday, September 13, 
2000, for breakfast to discuss the California/FERC wholesale issues that have 
been plaguing us and will plague us over the next year or so.   I suggest 
that the meeting be limited to:  (1) an identification of the inventory of 
forums we are facing; and (2) our allocation of resources to the inventory.  
If time permits, we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues.  In 
this regard, if its ready, we can present an overview of the California 
strategy that is being developed (initially) by Sandi and Jeff.   

Respond ASAP directly to Lysa Akin with your interest in participating in 
this meeting.

Lysa:  once we have a head count, please get us a meeting room and 
breakfast.  We'll need an easel with paper and markers.
