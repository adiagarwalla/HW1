Due to problems experienced by TAGG Deal Capture users a couple of weeks ago, 
we have made some modifications that will change the process of how a deal 
ticket is produced. Under the previous process, a user will request a Deal 
ticket to be generated and the TAGG application would basically schedule a 
job to generate and print the report on UNIX. The amount of time between the 
moment the user would click on the button to generate Deal Ticket and the 
time the actual ticket  printed was dependent on the amount of activity in 
the whole TAGG system. This time would range from about one minute to several 
minutes. Also, sometimes the ticket would never print. On the new version of 
the application, the report is generated directly from the user's machine and 
it will print on the default printer used by all the other windows 
applications on user's machine.  For  those users using dial-up, the 
processing will be done on the dial-up machine and the report will print on 
the default printer attached to the dial-up machine. From the user's point of 
view, in order to generate a Deal Ticket they need to follow exactly the same 
steps they were doing before. The processing going on behind the scenes will 
be different, but report will print almost instantaneously. Every effort has 
been made to replicate the report as close as possible, but there will be 
minor differences in formatting between old and new reports. 
We have put the new version of the TAGG application in the staging area. 
Please feel free to test it and verify that the information shown on Deal 
Ticket report is accurate. We have received feedback from people in London, 
Calgary and Singapore verifying that new version of report is correct. We are 
currently planning to roll this change into production the weekend of March 
10. If you have questions/problems or suggestions related to these changes, 
please notify Oscar Rivera x5-3361 or Sanjeev Gupta x5-3816 asap. 

thanks,

Oscar Rivera
