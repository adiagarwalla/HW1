In talking to Terry Kolwalke and Jodie Floyd apparently there is a timing issue between the two systems and this caused the problem.  There were some other measurement issues related to Bushton and they reran the numbers and cleared up these problems.

Subject:	Actual Volumes in TMS for October 26th

There is a problem between PGAS and TMS.  The actual volumes for the 26th are not correct in TMS.  In doing the Bushton PVR report I found that the actual volume in TMS did not match the actual volume in PGAS for the PVR measured.  I then began to look at other points, Spearman, Beaver Co's, etc; and found the same problem existed.
