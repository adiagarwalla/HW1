A couple of fyi items:

SoCal's balance was 151,133 mmbtus at 8/31/01.  Their balance is 300,521 mmbtus at 9/23/01.

We have received 33,130 mmbtus in payback from Williams through the 23rd which has decreased their balance to 242,260 mmbtus.

PG&E Topock's balance is 69,727 mmbtus due TW as of 9/23/01.


The index has decrease by about eighty cents during September which will cause a loss on volumetric oba's.
