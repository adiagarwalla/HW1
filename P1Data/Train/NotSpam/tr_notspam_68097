The  financial  deal  execution  rate  for  Enron North America  and  
Riskmantra  (natural gas  and  liquids)  for  the  period  between  January  
1,  1990  and  October 31, 1999  as  of   December  10, 1999  has  reached  
a  record  high  of  99.05% on  a  total  of  118,566  deals  with  117,435  
deals  being  "executed"  and  or  "expired-not  executed"  (but  cleared),  
with  only  1136  deals  remaining  open  for  this  period.  The  99.05%  
represents  an  increase  from  92.30%  in   March,  1999  execution  rate.  
This  is  record  territory  due  in  no  small  part  to  teams  working  
together  toward  a  common  goal  of  establishing  the  best   
relationship  with  our  customers  and  a  100%  execution  rate.  This  is  
Enron's  Visions  and  Values  applied.  Congradulations  to  all  of  the  
following  teams  for  a  job  well  done:  Deal Compliance, Legal and  
Credit . This  is  truly  a  fitting  ending  for  an  outstanding  1999.  
Happy  Holidays !
