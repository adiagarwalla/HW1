I'm a little nervous actually commenting that we have Shipper imbalances.  Here are my comments.

Subject:	SoCal Gas CPUC Proceeding 

Attached is a draft of the letter that we propose to send to the CPUC regarding the AL2837 proceeding in which SoCal Gas is proposing changes to its "windowing" criteria. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. We need to file this tomorrow, so please communicate any comments to me by the close of business today, if possible. Thanks.
