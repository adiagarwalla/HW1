Hi,


 This email is in reference to our plan for detailed discussions about Enron 
Credit's modeling strategy.  Several meetings have already been scheduled.  
Please refer to the attached Excel spreadsheet for further details.


 Also, if you like, we can have more informal discussions over lunch, dinner, 
drinks, etc.

 Thanks in advance for your time.

Regards,
Iris
