Attached is the PR plan prepared by Marathon for December and 1Q01.   I've 
also attached the draft CEO email specified in the plan and the target list 
of key industrial and technology leaders in California.   Please review the 
plan and preliminary messages.  Keep in mind that as the holidays are 
approaching rapidly, we need to move quickly to begin implementing the PR 
plan.  Please let me know by Friday, Dec. 15 if you have any comments, 
concerns or suggestions.

Thank you.
Karen
