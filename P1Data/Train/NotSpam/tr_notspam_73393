Attached for your review and comment please find drafts of Amendment 3 to 
Firm Gathering Agreement for Enron and Burlington.   Please review and 
provide any comments.  Hopefully we can get these executed this week.  


Regarding Amendment 2, which was the quality spec amendment, do you have the 
executed originals?  We have been unable to locate the signed version of that 
amendment. 

Best regards,
