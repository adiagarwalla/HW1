Dear Team Members:

I have scheduled our information session at OU for the evening of Thursday, 
September 27.  I will send more details as they are available, but please 
mark your calendars and let me know if you are interested in attending.

By the way, the football game against Kansas State is September 29th...   :)

Thanks!
