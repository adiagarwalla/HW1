A few comments.  Also, I reorganized the format extensively for what I 
thought was a better flow.  I didn't mark the changes, because it got too 
confusing.  



You can incorporate Christi's revisions with mine.  I was just about through 
when I got her message, so I didn't try to start over.  Please call me at 
X.35840 if you have any questions.

Subject: Talking points on gas in CA

Becky and Christi:

Attached are revised talking points on natural gas in CA.  I have made 
revisions to reflect our discussion yesterday (e.g., no price caps, basis 
differential is not explained by transportation costs, etc.).

As discussed, I hope to get input from the gas fundamentals group tomorrow 
and finalize this document by Friday.

I welcome your feedback.
