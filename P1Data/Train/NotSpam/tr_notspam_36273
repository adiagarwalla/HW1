Greetings All:

Here is a cut at message points and supporting sources to back them up.  All 
errors are mine (unless, like Steve Peace, I can find someone convenient to 
point a finger at.)  Particular thanks to Bruno, who helped enormously.  The 
document is, of course, incomplete and will require considerable work, but 
hope it offers a helpful point of departure.  We plan to continue working on 
it on Monday.  If I've missed anyone on the distribution, please forward 
along.  And if anyone has any questions, don't hesitate---415.782.7822.  I 
can be reached at home this weekend at 415.621.8317.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff
