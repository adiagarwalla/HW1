See attached for sample results for this months sample run. Larry I think the 
reson we got NDs on our samples is because the lab raised the reporting limit 
due to dilution necessary for analysis. Don't know why maybe you can find out 
for us. We won't use this lab next  time, we will be going back to Sherwood 
Labs.  Thanks, Randy
