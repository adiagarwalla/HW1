Nice to meet you this morning.  

Attached is a file containing the hardcopy data that John Griffith, Eric Boyt 
and I provided.  The gas trader expects the transaction to close today--we'll 
keep you posted.



In this transaction we owe gas to National Steel at far below current 
market.  When we unwind you will be long these dollars.

Louis
