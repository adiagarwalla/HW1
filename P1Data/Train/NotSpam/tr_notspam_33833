Subject: MTBE Stranded Costs/Liability Protection Efforts

Mark:

Steve Kean asked me to prepare the attached memo on our MTBE Stranded Cost & 
Liability Protection legislative efforts to provide some general background, 
discuss some of the potential effects of the language on a sale of the MTBE 
asset, and provide some outlook on the chances for enactment of these 
provisions.

If you have questions or require additional information, please contact me at 
any time.

Thanks,
