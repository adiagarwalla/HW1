Answer of PJM Interconnection, LLC., to Motion of New England Public Power 
Systems for Deferral of decision until January 15, 2001.  At issue is whether 
a ruling by the FERC on the merits of PJM as an RTO may set an unfair 
precident that may affect other regional RTO filings.  In their answer PJM 
asks that the FERC not delay action as requested by NEPPS and argues that the 
fact that a decision may be precedential clearly is not a basis for 
withholding a decision.  PJM adds that Commission guidance as a precedent 
would in fact, be beneficial to RTO development.  PJM is also concerned that 
a delay would affect the creation of PJM West with Allegheny Power since a 
deferal until January 15, 2001 may affect the negotiations and implementation.
