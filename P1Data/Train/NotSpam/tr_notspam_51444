Business cards are a great way to share information about yourself and your company when you want to network with others such as clients, businesses, vendors, and so on.  But if you are communicating via email, what do you do? A handy solution is electronic business cards, called vCards (virtual business cards), which you can send and receive in e-mail using Outlook  Many other e-mail and personal information manager (PIM) applications can use vCards as well, not just Outlook. For more information on vCards, visit the Internet Mail Consortium at http://www.imc.org/pdi/vcardoverview.html
Note: vCards are not needed when communicating with fellow employees, since we already have access to the Outlook address book and Peoplefinder. 
Settings Up Your vCard

1)  Verify Your Information
	- Open the address book ( )
	- Find and select your name
	- Double-click your name or click Properties
	- Is your information correct and complete?  If not, update it in eHRonline or contact your HR rep. 
2)  Create an AutoSignature with your vCard
	- Close any open messages
	- Click Tools, Options, Mail Format, Signature Picker
	- Click New and then type "vCard" for the name
	- Click Next and then click New vCard from Contact
	- Find and select your name, then click Add ->, OK 
	- Under the vCard Options section, change it from <None> to your name
	- Click OK, OK, Cancel  (make sure you click cancel or your vCard will be on every email you create)
Good job!  Your vCard is setup and ready to go. 

Sending an E-mail with your vCard
	
	- Create a new e-mail
	- Click Insert, Signature, vCard to insert your vCard 
	- Send your e-mail 

Receiving a vCard via E-mail

	- Add any additional information you wish
	- Click Save and Close
