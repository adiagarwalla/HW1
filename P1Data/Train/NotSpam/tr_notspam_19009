The SAP Reporting Team is currently scheduling Reporting Workshops for August 
and September.  These will be very focused, hands on, sessions from 1-4 hours 
long with around 5 people per session.   There is one overview class, Design 
& Data Flow, which will not be hands on but which will give you an overview 
of how data flows in the systems.   Each class will focus on how to pull 
reports within the specific module listed and how to use the standard SAP 
reporting tools.

Please review the list of classes below and provide me with a list of 
individuals that you would like to attend each type of session and your first 
and second choose of sessions.  It will work better if we can fill an entire 
class with people from either the same group or that perform the same 
function.  This will help keep the classes focused.  Please provide an 
initial list to me by noon Monday July 31st.

I will be out of the office on Thurs. and Friday July 27-28.  I my absence 
please feel free to call Kim Lesley at 5-77713.  She will be happy to answer 
any questions you may have.
