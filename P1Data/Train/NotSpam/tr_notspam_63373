The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the Execu=
tive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being an=
 Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this proces=
s.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is not=
 going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the st=
rength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception =
I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the e=
xception being granted.
