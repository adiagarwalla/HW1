Please find attached a spreadsheet noting the days of the month when you have 
been invited  to go to lunch with Carrie Hollomon.   If the days conflict 
with something you already have scheduled please call me at 3-6279 and we can 
work out another date.  Be sure and mark your calendars for each month as 
this does follow through to July. 




Thanks
Chantelle
