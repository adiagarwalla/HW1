Subject: The Associate and Analyst program needs you!


The off-cycle department of the Associate and Analyst program needs your 
help!  

We are looking for volunteer interviewers for the following dates:

Thursday, December 7th from 9:00 a.m. -12:30 p.m.

Over 50 candidates will be interviewing this day.  The candidates will be a 
combination of Associates and Analysts representing schools such as Harvard, 
Princeton, SMU, MIT, University of Illinois, Emory and many others.  Each 
candidate will have 4 interviews.  Pending the outcome of their interviews we 
will invite them to stay and attend Super Saturday that weekend.  If for some 
reason we decide not to further pursue the candidate, we will fly them home 
that Friday morning.

In addition to the interviews on December 7th there will be a breakfast 
buffet from 7:45 a.m. to 8:45 a.m.  and a luncheon from 12:30 p.m. - 2:00 
p.m.  Interviewers are welcome to attend both the breakfast and the lunch on 
their interviewing date.  The interviewing, breakfast and lunch will take 
place at the Hyatt.  The interviews will be held in the Imperial Ballroom, 
and both breakfast and lunch will be held in the Regency Room.

We are asking Enron employees associate (associates who have been with the 
program for at least one year) level or higher  to volunteer at least ONE 
HOUR to interview candidates (this will be 2 interviews).  If you can 
volunteer for more than an hour or for more than just one of the stated 
dates, that would be great!  Your help is needed!  Please contact my 
assistant, Cathy Lira, at cathy.lira@.com or x54049 as soon as possible, 
if you can volunteer any time for interviewing.  Please include the times 
that you can interview and whether or not you will be able to join us for 
breakfast and lunch.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Once again, thanks,
Althea
