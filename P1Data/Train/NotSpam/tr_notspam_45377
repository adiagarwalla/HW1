Deadline for offer letters
- We plan an email this afternoon extending the deadline thru 9am tomorrow for those who haven't signed yet.

Deadline for Employment Agreements
- given all the changes we are planning to make to the base form, we are planning extending this to "24 hours from when they are presented with next draft".
