Hi-

We have access to the SAS Online Tutorial for the next 30 days. Point your 
browser to 

http://www2.sas.com/onlinetutor_v8prod/welcome.htm

and use the username "" and password "" to enter.

The way this product works is designed for a single user (it sets a "cookie" 
allowing you to "resume" your place in the tutorial when you re-enter.) 

Since several of us may use it, we'll need to work around this, each of us 
remembering where we were before and recreating any sample data sets, etc 
necessary for the lesson in progress.

Clayton

PS The module EIS/OLAP will be a part of our installation next month, but is 
not currently available

PPS Please remember to use your local browser to browse the SAS Online 
Documentation. Invoking a browser on the Unix server is inefficient.
