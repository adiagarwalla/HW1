From today's Gas Daily, in case you haven't seen it yet.......

 El Paso Merchant Energy will be passing up on its right of first refusal f=
or=20
up to 1.22 billion
cfd of capacity on El Paso Natural Gas, sources said yesterday. El Paso wou=
ld=20
not comment
on the report but said the company would issue a statement soon.
 The capacity, from the San Juan Basin to California, was open for bids unt=
il=20
Feb. 12, and
El Paso Merchant Energy held a right of first refusal at six receipt points=
=20
until May 31. El Paso
Merchant paid $38.5 million for the capacity, which was previously held by=
=20
Dynegy Energy
Marketing.
 The capacity has been the source of controversy in the wake of California=
=01,s=20
ongoing energy
crisis, with companies concerned that an affiliated company held the pipeli=
ne=20
capacity.
The California Public Utilities Commission alleged in a FERC complaint that=
=20
the agreement
between the companies was "rigged" (GD 1/11).
 "There has been a lot of pressure," said Gordon Howald, an analyst with=20
Credit Lyonnais
Securities. "Everyone is blaming them for what=01,s going on in California,=
=20
though I believe
FERC did clear them."
 Howald said that giving up that capacity and allowing the "market to decid=
e=20
the value"
would help El Paso on two fronts.
 "It probably makes sense considering the pressure they=01,ve been under fr=
om=20
regulators,"
Howald said. And "their pipeline operations could essentially garner some=
=20
higher profitability
if they are able to increase the value of that capacity in an open season."=
