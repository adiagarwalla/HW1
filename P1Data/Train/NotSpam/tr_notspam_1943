Currently,  prior month deals are inactivated in Sitara for portfolio 
purposes on the 10th of the month.  
  For system efficiencies we would like to inactivate September deals this 
weekend if possible.   This will have no affect on volume feedback.
  A system enhancement is being worked on so that we would not have to try to 
inactivate earlier than normal for next month.

Please contact me if this timing would cause you any problems.

Thank you

Russ
