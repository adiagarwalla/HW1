An outage that was previously scheduled for the 21st @ Morinville & Albert Lea compressors on Alliance was moved to the 20th and AOS was reduced to 10% for 1 day only, the rest of the month we should see high AOS at least over 20%.  There was also maintenance scheduled for the 27th but this has been cancelled.  


Any questions give me a call

Thanks
