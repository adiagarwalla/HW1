items such as outage schedules and notification protocols as well as
consumer tax credits.

purchase gas from public agencies and permit irrigation districts to
explore for gas.  This is identical to ABX1 39.

is identical to ABX1 128.

ABX2 7 (Simitian) - This would establish a formula for standby charges
for QFs.  This is identical to ABX1 108.

ABX2 9 (Migden) - This would permit local governments to aggregate
provided that IOUs provide metering and billing services.  This is
identical to ABX1 48.

ABX2 10 (Hertzberg) - This would require, as a condition of receiving a
permit from the CEC, that a generator enter into a contract with DWR or
a municipal utility.  This is identical to ABX1 60.

ABX2 11 (Wright) - This would permit governmental entities currently
served by SCE and LADWP to be served only by LADWP.  This is identical
