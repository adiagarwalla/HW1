Please read the following message from Kathie Grabstald and Michelle Vitrella 
in Public Relations.  The Weekly Electronic Newsletter is a project that Mark 
Frevert requested and it is important that Enron Global Markets be 
responsive  when we are asked for information from our business units.  
Please pass along to Kathie and Michelle the name of a contact person in your 
group that will be responsible for providing updates for the weekly 
newsletter.  Kathie has assured me that the person providing the information 
is not required to do the actual writing, but provide bullet points which she 
will then prepare in paragraph form.  Michelle will send a reminder message 
to the contact person when the updates are needed.

Thank you for your assistance with this project.

Subject: Newsletter

Under the direction of Mark Frevert, ENA Public Relations has created a 
Weekly Electronic Newsletter giving employees the latest news in Enron North 
America, Industrial Markets and Global Markets with the click of a button.  
Our goal is to provide information about recent developments and events from 
the various business units straight from the source, YOU!  We need your 
cooperation and participation since ENA/EGM/EIM readers want to know more 
about Global Markets.  Please help open the door for us by getting your 
direct reports on board and encouraging them to send us news.

Watch for a weekly reminder email giving upcoming newsletter deadlines.  If 
anyone needs assistance formatting business highlights, we will help turn 
their bullet points into paragraphs.

Thank you.
