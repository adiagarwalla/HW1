Thanks for signing up to help with our Dept. Birthday parties....

Here's our list..........and remember, I'll be glad to back everyone up each 
month, so let me know what items are needed...
 Please recruit helpers (as needed).... some people may have been shy about 
signing up, but probably would enjoy being involved if asked.

thanks again, Sandy
