The scanner is finally up and running. 

The computer and software have been updated.  It takes a fraction of the time 
to scan, format and correct documents.  It is now faster to scan a 1 page 
document than to retype it.  The software is now supported by Enron, and the 
IT Department is working on getting us a manual.

Only one log on ID will be used.  Please get that ID and password from me or 
in my absence from Becky or Janette.

Because it was installed yesterday, I am not fully up to speed on the new 
updated version of Omni Page (which has been simplified) however, I will be 
happy to assist you with your scanning needs.

Thanks!
