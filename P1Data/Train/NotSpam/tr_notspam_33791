The attached memo describes a recent decision from the National Labor 
Relations Board regarding an employee's right to be "represented" by a 
co-worker or other person during a disciplinary meeting.  Employees in 
unionized settings always have had this right, but it now has been extended 
by the NLRB's ruling.

 The ruling was contentious -- there were dissents -- and I expect it to be 
appealed quickly.  Nonetheless, if an Enron employee wants to have someone 
sit in on a disciplinary meeting, please call me to discuss how to proceed 
before responding to that request.  We want to be careful to avoid a finding 
of an unfair labor practice.

Thanks.  Michelle
