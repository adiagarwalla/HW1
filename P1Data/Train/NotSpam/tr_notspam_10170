Sorry guys, but you will not be migrated until Tuesday, May 1st after 
hours.   The reason being they want the pilot runners (Steve South & Susan 
Scott) on their machines a few more days before they migrate everyone else 
over.  The migration team wants to make sure there will not be any problems 
with everyone's applications.
