Attached is the override letter which was used in connection with the LM6000 
turbine contract as it was moved into TurboPark.  This letter highlights the 
97-10 and lender requirements.  I hope you find it useful.






This is the type of letter that was included for the Pastoria and Blue Dog 
equipment.  This shows one approach to assignment under TurboPark.  This is 
also included in the other override, it is just easier to access here for 
assignment:
