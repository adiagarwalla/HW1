Media reports out of France indicate that explosions have just taken place at two chemical plants in the southern city of Tououse.  The main explosion reportedly took place at a plant that manufactures fuel for Arianespace, the European Space Agency's commercial arm.  Explosions have also been reported at a plant owned by Groupe SNPE, which manufactures propellants and explosives.  The incidents are reported to have involved deaths at the scene.

We have yet to acquire independent confirmation of the explosions, or whether terrorism is suspected.  We are in touch with military and intelligence sources, and will provide updates.
