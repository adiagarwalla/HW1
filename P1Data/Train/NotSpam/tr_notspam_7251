Subject: Conference Call to discuss response to FERC 1 Nov. Order

Ron Carroll will have our final response to FERC late tonight for review 
first thing tomorrow before filing.

discuss the draft.  Therefore, in order to discuss, I have set a conference 
call as follows:

Date: Wed., Nov. 22nd
Time: 7:00am Pacific / 9:00am Central / 10:00am Eastern
800#: 888/422-7116
Pin#: 109963

Pin # for Mary Hain ONLY: 385359

Please contact Lysa at 503/464-7927 if you cannot attend.

Thanks!
