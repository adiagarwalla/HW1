Tva's Solar Project Will Power 50 Homes

The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to build one of the largest urban solar 
power projects in the country this summer, with enough panels to cover a 
240-space parking lot. 
The solar panels will generate up to 90 kilowatts of electricity, enough to 
meet the power needs of about 50 homes and shelter football fans at the 
downtown Finley Stadium. 
"It's a great site," said Gary Harris, manager of TVA's Green Power program. 
"It's a very visible location from the highway coming into downtown 
Chattanooga and will allow thousands of persons who go to the stadium to see 
the solar panels up close." 
The panels will provide covered parking and shade on the south side of the 
stadium. TVA will spend more than $500,000 to pave the parking lot and erect 
the panels. 
The project is a part of TVA's Green Power Switch, a pilot launched last 
year, allowing customers in select cities to choose electricity generated by 
wind, sunlight and landfill gas. 
Most of TVA's power comes from nuclear, fossil-fuel and hydroelectric plants. 
More than 3,600 TVA customers have agreed to pay more for power generated 
from renewable sources. People may buy blocks of "green power" in 150 
kilowatt-hour bulks for an extra $4 a month. 
TVA has already sold more than 11,000 blocks, or enough to generate more than 
$528,000 in extra revenue annually. 
TVA, which generates solar power from nine sites across the valley, also has 
qualified for federal assistance for its program through the Virginia 
Alliance for Solar Energy.
