Please find attached flowchart detailing procedures to handle cash payment 
related to Merlin Assets(Co 72R) in the Wilmington Trust Account.  Please 
update the designated cash schedule frequently in order to eliminate 
unnecessary e-mails between each individual accountant and Ann Roberts @ 
Wilmington Trust.

Thanks and let me know if you have questions related to the process.
