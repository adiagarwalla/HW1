The purpose of this call is to prepare materials for Steve Kean who is 
appearing before Chairmen Tauzin and Barton and other Republican members of 
the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Feb 21.  The meeting/roundtable 
will be held in California.  Although this is not an official congressional 
hearing, we need to inventory what Steve will need for his presentation.  
Thanks.
