It's official!  Dawn and Gary Wilson are the proud parents of a beautiful baby girl.  She was born at 10:41am on 9-20-01, and weighed in at 6lbs, 13oz.  They named her Grace Elizabeth.  Mom and baby are doing great and the proud  father delivered the news at 1:00pm.  Dawn is registered at Texas Womens Hospital under the last name of Kenne.

I'm sure you will all join me in wishing the new family lots of joy!

Thanks,

JLR
