Greg Whalley has available Diamond level seats (4 + parking) for the 2001 Astros' season.   Greg would like to offer you usage of these tickets for customer relations and employee appreciation.  Listed below are some of the amenities associated with the diamond club.  Please contact me, Liz Taylor, @ x31935 for availability.


Parking:  Your parking pass enables you to park in the lot closest to Enron Field.


Dining:  A private dining room is located behind the field-side seating area.  Special requests should be phoned in at least 3 hrs prior to game time.  


Hours:  The Diamond Club opens two hrs before the first pitch and closes 1/2 hr after the final out is recorded.



Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
