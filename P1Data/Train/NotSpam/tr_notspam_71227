Subject: 6/15/00 Revision to Sea Robin Volumes


Christina,
The attached shows the volumes that should have been nominated effective 
6/15/00 and 6/16/00.  The Sea Robin plant was back up for those two days and 
gas was processed resulting in a decrease for PVR.  Effective 6/17/00, the 
plant was down again and volumes were increased to reflect no processing 
loss.  I forwarded those volumes to you on Friday, June 16.

Let me know of any questions you have.

Thanks,
Steve
