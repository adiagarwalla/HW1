From MIKE ROBERTS Group:

Hello!

Here's how you and the people you work with can access our website:

http://enaresearch.corp..com

Use the drop-down menu on the left to go to what you need.  Weather is 
especially helpful.  If you have any problems pulling it up, or if you have 
any other questions, I am here to help.  E-mail me!

I encourage you to forward this to your people on the trading floor.

Or, you can call me at 58322.


Thank You,

Sam Smith
