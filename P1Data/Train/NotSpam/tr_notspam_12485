Subject: Update of Executive Support Database

Hello to all Support Staff.   I am Montrice Malone, Support Clerk for the 
Executive Support Team.  I am updating the Executive Support Database.  In 
order to better serve their IT needs for home support, the following 
information is needed.  

Executive name, cell phone, home phone, home street, home city, home zip 
code, spouse if any.  In addition, because you are primary support you are 
also eligible for home support from the IT executive home support team. We 
also need your home phone, home street, home zip code,
for our records. Thank you very much for your assistance and information.  
You may reply to this e-mail or contact me at EXT# 5-3600. 

Thanks,
Montrice Malone
Executive Support Team Clerk
Office: 713-345-3600
