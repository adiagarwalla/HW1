Attached is SCE's proposal for implementation of the California Procurement
Adjustment under ABX-1. I will be sending SDG&E's and PG&E's under separate
e-mail.

Please review carefully each carefully. Specifically note the SCE's and
PG&E's provisions for dealing with the direct access credit.  The ALJ Ruling
in this proceeding states that parties may serve modifications the UDCs'
proposals on February 28th (or put in their own proposal for a CPA).  The
ruling the provides for parties to "serve comments on any of the proposals
for a CPA" on March 5th.  Bottom line is I think we can get away with not
commenting until the 5th. In either case, there is not a lot of time, so
please get me any thoughts/comments concerns as soon as possible.
