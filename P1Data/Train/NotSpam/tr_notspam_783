Subject:=09Unify Gas Production Migration Schedule Changes

I wanted to send this letter to update everyone on the latest schedule for =
the Unify Gas migration to MS SQL Server.

As most of you are already aware, the migration date has been moved to June=
 8, with the new Unify Gas system being available for June 11 business. In =
light of this change, the following dates have been identified for key task=
s:

May 10 - 11: Power Stage Server will undergo maintenance and configuration =
verification.
May 12 - 13: Power Production Server will undergo maintenance and configura=
tion verification

May 13: Testing of newly configured Unify Power Production Server

May 18 - 19: Gas Dry Run#3 of the cut-over activities

May 24 - 31: Bid Week simulation on MS SQL Gas Production Server with Sybas=
e

June 1 - 2: Gas Final Dry Run of cut-over activities

June 8 - 10: Gas Production cut-over to MS SQL Server

June 11: Unify Gas Go Live on MS SQL Server

There will be additional user performance tests scheduled as the need arise=
s and with user management approval. Everyone will be informed of the dates=
 and times as these tests are approved and scheduled.=20

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Thanks,
