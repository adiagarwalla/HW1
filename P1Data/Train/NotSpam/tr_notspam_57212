Subject: Summary of Commission Meeting


In the Commission meeting today:

GridFlorida=01,s application to form an RTO in the Florida peninsula was=20
approved with certain distinct directives. Namely, GridFlorida must improve=
=20
stakeholder participation;  must report on further developments to ensure=
=20
obligations of reliability and interface functions according to Order 2000;=
=20
and must further define the rights of passive owners understanding that any=
=20
veto rights of passive owners will be subject to review by FERC. RT01-67

Southwest Power Pool=01,s application to form an hybrid RTO is rejected. SP=
P=01,s=20
application was limited to Entergy and SPP only and therefore, has not mean=
t=20
the scope and regional configuration as directed by Order 2000. The require=
d=20
report according to the Federal Power Act, Section 203 was not filed. The=
=20
order does permit SPP to change its merger affiliation to join an RTO and=
=20
approves the filing regarding the board selection process. RT01-34

FERC is issuing a Notice, RM99-2 inviting comments from the industry  on=20
interregional coordination. A technical conference will be scheduled after=
=20
comments are received. FERC has been disappointed in the filings with regar=
d=20
to the interregional participation; hence, the Notice.

CPUC v. El Paso, RP00-241. This order discusses CPUC=01,s complaint that El=
 Paso=20
Merchant intentionally acquired more capacity than needed to manipulate pri=
ce=20
spreads. The order dismisses denies summary judgment and dismisses the=20
complaint. FERC stated that El Paso Merchant has not violated any standards=
=20
of conduct. With respect to the issue of market power, the current record i=
s=20
not considered to be complete. However, FERC will schedule a hearing to=20
complete and review the record.=20
