Note:  Official results not yet released.   Kern River currently has a 
project on file for an expansion to be placed in service on 5-1-02 for 
124,500 Dth/day at a cost of $80MM.  

Second Kern River Open Season Successful
Williams' Kern River Gas Transmission last week completed an open season for 
added firm capacity on its pipeline into Nevada and/or California amid rave 
reviews, although specific details were not yet released by the Salt Lake 
City-based interstate pipeline. 
"The results were outstanding," said a Williams spokesperson in Salt Lake 
City. "I mean they were huge, but we don't have that many details yet." The 
pipeline indicated it should have more information this week. 
New service resulting from this open season would be available May 1, 2003 
for terms of 10 or 15 years, the company said at the time of starting the 
two-month open season. The capacity dates are geared to coincide with the 
proposed opening of several new electric generating plants in Nevada and 
California, and since that date the call for added generation throughout the 
western states has been reiterated as it was at last Friday's Western 
Governors' Association energy roundtable in Portland, OR. 
Although Kern River has ruled out proposing new laterals, it has indicated it 
planned to help meet the increased gas demand for new power plants by adding 
compression and looping. The company has intends to finalize expansion design 
and rate impact analyses following the close of this most recent open season. 
Another open season last fall was held on an added 124,500 Dth/d of firm 
transportation capacity into California along Kern's 922-mile interstate 
pipeline from Wyoming (see Daily GPI, Nov. 16, 2000 <d20001116g.html>).
