Hello!

I updated our 2000 Goals and Objectives to include items that we discussed in 
this week's staff meeting.  Please use this list when you build your own 
individual goals for your performance review.

Of course, your list should include items specific to your desk, but we will 
all have to work together to accomplish our team goals.  I envision that we 
may establish a responsible person/persons for each of the team goals so that 
can "divide and conquer."

Thanks again for all of your effort this year, and I look forward to an even 
better Year 2000!

Thanks,
Carrie
