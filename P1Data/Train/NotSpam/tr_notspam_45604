Jim-I have to be in Denver on Tuesday and Wednesday to finish up a transaction for our West Coast office.  I hope to finish on Wednesday so I can come to San Antonio on Thursday for the rest of the conference.  I am sorry to miss this meeting, but will look forward to an update on the topics discussed.  Thanks.
