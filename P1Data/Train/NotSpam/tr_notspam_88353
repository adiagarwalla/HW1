I anticipate that Samantha will be out of the office for a time.  In order 
that Samantha's work in progress be covered in her absence, please take the 
following steps.  The attorneys should retrieve from her desk and files those 
current file matters for which they are responsible.  To the extent you and 
your administrative assistant can cover the file matters, please do so in 
order to maintain a reasonable workload for the other paralegals.  If some of 
your file matters need further paralegal assistance, please advise me so that 
reassignments to other paralegals can be coordinated based upon the workloads 
of Susan, Stephanie, and Tana.  Thank you.


Cordially,
Mary Cook
