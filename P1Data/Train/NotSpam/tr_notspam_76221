Re: TETCO Electric Power Cost Adjustment Effective 02/01/02

On December 27, 2001 Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation 
(TETCO) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP02-131 to 
reflect its Electric Power Cost Adjustment.  Included in the 
filing were revised rates under TETCO's Rate Schedule X-28 which 
Transco uses to render service under its Rate Schedule S-2.  The 
revised rates have a proposed effective date of February 1, 2002, 
and if accepted as proposed would result in the following changes 
in Transco's Rate Schedule S-2 rates: 

Demand Rate - $0.0270 increase
Demand Charge Adjustment - $0.0021 increase
Withdrawal Rate - $0.0008 increase

Please refer any questions to Mike Heeney, Rate Department, at
