Attached please find the referenced list.  Some additional comments are as 
follows:

1.  City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals.
2.  Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).  It can only 
trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.

As usual, no European power until further notice.
