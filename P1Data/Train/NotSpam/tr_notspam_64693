There have been many changes recently in the Associate and Analyst program. Ted Bland, Director of Career Development for the program, will be in Portland on July 5 and would like to meet with all of you to discuss the changes and answer any questions you may have. I think that this is a great opportunity to hear first hand what is happening!

Please let me know if you will be able to attend - Grace will be ordering Mexican for lunch!

Thanks!
Amy
