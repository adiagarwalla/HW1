FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  WEDNESDAY, APRIL 5, 2000
NEW CLEAN-FUEL REQUIREMENT ADDRESSES 'MTBE' CONCERNS
Rule Adopted Today Applies to Eastern Third of State

A new rule adopted today by the Texas Natural Resource Conservation
Commission (TNRCC) places limits on increases in the use of the gasoline
additive MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) while still retaining the air
quality benefits of cleaner burning fuels.

The requirement, which applies to gasoline sold in 95 counties comprising
the eastern third of the state, prohibits the increased use of MTBE to meet
a requirement that the gasoline evaporates less quickly than conventional
gasoline.

The new rule also requires all parties in the gasoline distribution chain to
maintain proper documentation of fuel transfers, and gasoline producers must
certify in annual reports that the use of MTBE in their gasoline has not
been increased to meet the low evaporative requirements.

The MTBE provisions in the new rule address concerns about how this
additive, which is highly water soluble, can adversely affect water quality
if spilled into a stream or groundwater.

While the TNRCC estimates that drinking water containing levels as high as
240 parts per billion (ppb) of MTBE over a lifetime would have no adverse
health effects, concentrations as low as 15 ppb can cause significant odor
and taste problems in drinking water.
