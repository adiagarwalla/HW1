Hi everyone

Just a quick reminder that we have an EBS  offsite meeting coming up -- 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY, OCTOBER 16TH AND 17TH -- IN VANCOUVER, B.C.
This is just a quick email to remind everyone to put this on their calendars 
-- we will be staying at the Hotel Waterfront -- I have already taken care of 
the room reservations --   we have a block of rooms reserved, all harborside 
rooms -- I will send more information on the hotel -- confirmation room 
numbers, etc. and meeting times as well as extracurricular activities planned

Please take the time to locate your birth certificate and/or passport since 
you may need these documents to get into Canada -- you need either a) your 
driver's license and birth certificate OR b) a passport -- 

I will be sending out another email with more information -- please let me 
know at this time if you will be attending the meeting.
