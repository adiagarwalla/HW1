Duane Hart has been offered opportunities at two other companies that provide 
compensation packages far more lucrative than anything EOTT can afford or 
justify at this time.

Last night I had dinner with another candidate, Nick Bednorz, VP and 
Controller of Coral Energy, that I would like you to meet.
Nick comes highly recommended by Stan Horton and Rod Hayslett.

Shelly will coordinate the meetings.
