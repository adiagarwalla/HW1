August 29, 30, 31
You will be receiving more information from Rick and Cindy, but here are the 
dates for the offsite Rick and Cindy are hosting to:
 Assess what we have accomplished with SAP relative to the original goals
 Assess where we are today (new initiatives on the horizon, acquisition 
strategy, state of the COE, etc)
 Determine strategically where we go next.

For those that participated in either or both of the original ASEs 
(Accelerated Solutions Environment, a professionally facilitated, 
specially-designed location for rapid, large-group decision making), this 
event will be similar in format (not content).  If you have not previously 
particpated in an ASE, detailed information will be forthcoming.

The likely location is Dallas (a new ASE has just been opened there).  We MAY 
be able to trim this down to two days (not probable, but we are going to 
try), but for now please plan on 3 full days (8 am to 7 pm or later).

The above is not the final invitee list (we will likely add a few more 
people), but we wanted to geet this on your calendars as soon as we had the 
date.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you will or will not be able 
to attend, and if there is anyone from your organization that you feel is 
critical to achieving the objectives above.

Thank you!
