As previously indicated, we expect to secure permission from the lenders to 
submit our preliminary termination notice PTN to MSEB.  It appears that this 
may occur today, but that the strongest likelihood is that we would have the 
submission going out on either Saturday morning or even stretching into 
Monday or Tuesday of next week.  

Attached is the statement we planned to use with the media.  We will keep you 
apprised of further developments.

Please let me know if you require additional information.
