I just got a call from Stuart Rosman, who is meeting with the referenced 
counterparty right now.  NCPA would like to get a password in place today to 
start trading, and there seems to be some confusion as to what types of 
transactions they can do online.  Per my earlier approval, this counterparty 
can trade any physical products under the credit terms established by 
Credit.  They, however, cannot trade financial until we get an ISDA Master in 
place (and have told Stuart they are currently not interested in trading 
financial).

Stuart said he would be calling Carrie in about 1/2 to make sure this message 
is conveyed to her.

If anyone is aware of any problems here, please convey them to Carrie ASAP!
