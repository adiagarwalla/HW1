Subject: Dec. 7 - SDG&E Press Release


CRECers,

Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
transportation to the CA border.
