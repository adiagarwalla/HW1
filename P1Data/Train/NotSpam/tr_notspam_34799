For those of you who did not see the memos from Jeff that went out on 
February 17th. & February 22nd. regarding the upcoming Options training 
classed, I have attached both memos below:



I have the books at my desk for those of you that have not received your 
copy.  

There will be a third memo in the next couple of days with regards to the 
location of the classes.

If you have any other questions, please feel free to contact me.
