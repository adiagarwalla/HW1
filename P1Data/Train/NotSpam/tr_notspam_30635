After a brief discussion with Greek regarding our consolidated return-to-accrual impact, he has suggested that Sr. Specialists and above that were involved in either the year-end accrual or the return review process meet with him tomorrow to discuss our respective RTA adjustments.  Michelle Thompson and I will be preparing a summary schedule tonight of the "material" issues that we believe Greek may address tomorrow.  Please refer to the original schedule that Michelle sent and be prepared to discuss any RTA adjustments that could your P&L.   In the interim, please call if you have any questions.  

Thanks,

Robbie
