Attached are my notes from the session with the Alliance for Energy suppliers 
held today at Reliant's offices.  You'll see from the notes that this effort 
isn't going anywhere fast.  Nonetheless, I thought you would be interested in 
the market intelligence of how other pipelines, particularly Tennessee, are 
dealing with the generators.
