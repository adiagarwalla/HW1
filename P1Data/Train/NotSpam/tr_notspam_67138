Hi All!

We have set this Wed., May 23 at 2 PM for Catherine's baby shower.
Currently, I have a $150 target card as a present for her.  Jen and I are 
also 
going to run out and grab a book and an outfit or two tomorrow.  These items, 
as well as the cake and ice cream, will be from the entire office.  If you 
would 
like to buy her something of your own feel free.  Otherwise, you can make a 
donation to the gift card and other items.  If you are looking for a donation 
amount, 
anywhere from $5 - $10 is adequate, but there is no pressure to give 
anything.  I will 
be out of the office so Jen will be coordinating everything that day.
