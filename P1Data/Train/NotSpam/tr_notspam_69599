Miriam,

Sounds like a great growth opportunity for you.  Best of luck!  

Elizabeth,  we will need to solicit a replacement for Miriam; hopefully we 
can accomplish this prior to her leaving so that she might have time to 
transition the new person.  Ideas as to how to proceed would be greatly 
appreciated.

Thanks!

--Christie.
