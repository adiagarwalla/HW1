We received the $15MM L/C from Black Hills Corp. so we are done - we have a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Black Hills Energy Capital to divest of JEDI II/Enron's effective 100% membership interest in Southwest Power L.L.C.  Southwest's assets consist of Las Vegas Cogeneration L.P., Sunco, Ltd. L.L.C and Las Vegas Cogeneration II, L.L.C.  Financial closure is expected on or before August 31, 2001.
