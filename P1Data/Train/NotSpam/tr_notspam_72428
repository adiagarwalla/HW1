Subject: Today's Chamber Meeting

I attended the Chamber meeting today and the  discussion focused on P.R. 
efforts for large users focusing on core and non-core opposition. Bob Foster 
with Edison made a presentation regarding support of M.O.U. and Fred Keeley 
came in and described Hertzberg's Plan B which mostly emphasized direct 
access. Hertzberg's Plan B was not particularly well received by the user 
groups. More details later.
