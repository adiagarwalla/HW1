The Methanol plant has determined extensive repairs are needed, including 
replacement of piping and retubing of 2 of the 3 preheat exchangers.

It appears that the plant will be down until the last week of the month.  At 
a minimum, the plant will be down until the middle of next week.    A better 
estimate of downtime will be available by tomorrow afternoon.
