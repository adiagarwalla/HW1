Thanks for the up-date. I think it is very good for Enron to be seen as a
leader in these dicussions. Particularly, I beleive that this process takes
much of the steam out of any attempt by the Bureau to portrait Enron as
someone who is not prepared to play within the rules. As well, Enron is
building credibility with the Regulators in Alberta which in my view may
serve us quite well down the road on Prject Stanley. I plan to keep Glenn
Leslie and Web MacDonald in the loop because I really think the two
processes are linked. Regards Dan.
