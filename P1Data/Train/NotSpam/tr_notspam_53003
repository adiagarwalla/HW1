Kayne,

As we discussed, dinner has been ordered for Thursday (11/23), scheduled to 
arrive a 12noon for everyone (day/night workers) - this is due to the time 
they close.  Please have guys keep the receipt to be expensed, as well as, 
place the others meal in the refrigerator.  On Friday, the guys will be going 
out to get lunch/dinner and we would expense it.  I ordered from the 
following:

Place: Randall's Catering/Shephard Square 
 (713) 284-1200

Delivery Information:  Thursday, November 23, 2000 @ 12 noon

Contact:  David Finkler

Includes:  The Traditional Thanksgiving Dinner:  Turkey, Ham, Dressing, 2 
vegetables, Rolls, Pie, Condiments, plates, etc.


If you should need additional information or have any questions, please see 
me.

Have a very HAPPY THANKSGIVING!

Thanks,
