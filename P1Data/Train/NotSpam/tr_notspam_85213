Hi Sue,

You are correct that we won't be meeting.  I think the only outstanding issue 
is for accounting to decide whether we should use ETI, which is a C Corp, or 
another vehicle.  I'll keep you posted.

Sue

Sue--I had a meeting on my calendar for this coming Thursday Dec 14.  Am I 
correct that we won't be meeting since the EBS commercial folks signed off on 
the game plan for CLEC certifications?  

If you are still planning on meeting, could we do it around lunch time or 
early afternoon?  I need to be in Chicago that evening for a reception that 
one of the ICC commissioners is having.
