I took a crack at tightening up the E Next assignment language as it
exists
in the overrides, for inclusion in WH form:

(See attached file: world hunger assn.DOC)

Peter, could you take first cut at the override letter?  We  may be
having
an internal meeting at 930 central, and if so, will you be available by
phone if necessary?

Suz, please put the attachment in the notebook.

Thanks,

Kay
