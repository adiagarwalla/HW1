Vince:

Please send an email to:  iBuyit@.com   stating that you are approver
of invoices as requested in the email below.  We cannot purchase anything
until you do.

iBuyit Payables Approvers
We need your help to identify future iBuyit Approvers.  Please encourage the people that approve your invoices to identify themselves as future iBuyit users by sending an email with their name, e-mail address, and whether they code or approve invoices to <<mailto:iBuyit@.com>>.  On-line materials for approvers will be available beginning next week via the Integrated Solution Center Document Library at <http://sap..com/sap_doclib/user/default.asp>.  Materials will include an overview of the system and step-by-step instructions.  Identified approvers will receive an e-mail with links to these materials next week.

Thanks!


Shirley
