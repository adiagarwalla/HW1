All,

There has been some concern about the lack of clarity regarding what 
functionality is ready for user acceptance testing in the staging 
environment.  To attempt to solve this problem, we have come up with a simple 
process that will enhance communication and will allow everyone on the team 
to know what functionality is in staging waiting for user acceptance signoff 
prior to a release to production.  Please read the attached one page document 
that details the proposed process.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Zach
