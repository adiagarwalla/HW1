This is a reminder that the ect..com,ei..com,and ees..com Email domains will be decommissioned by close of business Friday, January 18th. If you currently use an Email address of name@ect..com, name@ei..com or name@ees..com, you will need to notify your contacts to send mail to you at firstname.lastname@.com.

This is the first step of several to standardize everyone's Email address to firstname.lastname@.com. 

If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to .messaging.administration@.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.
