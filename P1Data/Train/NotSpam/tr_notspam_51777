Good afternoon Mr. Ball:

The Enron Corp. Research Group would like to conduct an informal interview 
with you at your convenience.  Please give me some dates and times within
the next 2 weeks that you might be available and I will arrange the schedule.

The people that will be interviewing you are:

Vince Kaminski   Managing Director
Stinson Gibner   Vice President
Grant Masson   Vice President
Vasant Shanbhogue  Vice President
Krishna Krishnarao  Director
Zimin Lu   Director
Tanya Tamarchenko  Manager
Alex Huang   Manager

Each individual interview will last approximately 15 - 20 minutes, so we 
probably
should allow at least  3 hours.

If you would prefer to call me with some dates and times - I can check 
the calendars while we are talking.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Thank you.

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Research Group
