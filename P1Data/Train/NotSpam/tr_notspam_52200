On November 17, 2001 between 01:00 and 05:00 Entergy will be switching to an OASIS node provided by ESCA. During the outage customers will NOT have access to the current OASIS site provided by MAIN. Once the OASIS comes back online there will be a link at the current OASIS site provided by MAIN that will direct customers to the new OASIS site provided by ESCA. Once the new OASIS node is up, the customers should not have any trouble accessing the site.
