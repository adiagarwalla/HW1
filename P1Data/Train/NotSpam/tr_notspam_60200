Please sign the reverse side of three of your business cards in thick black 
ink and have your administrative assistant deliver them to Ron Nolte X37569, 
Location 1861D. Ron will scan your signature and send it to you as an e-mail 
attachment. Upon receipt of your scanned signature, save it in your H:/ drive 
in a familiar folder for future access. Your H:/ drive is a secure drive, 
only accessible to the respective user profile.

We would like to implement the automated Manual Wire process a.s.a.p.
