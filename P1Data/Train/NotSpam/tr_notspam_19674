The testing process now includes the Flow Gas app.  All testing was completed successfully, and we have confirmed with ENW Resolution Center that Exchange servers are up.  We experienced performance issues for two brief periods with Exchange servers 1 and 3 this week.  Although the ENW Resolution Center has provided no detail, we are following up with the Messaging team.
