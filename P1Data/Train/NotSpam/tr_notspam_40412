In the Spirit of giving, the Global Group has just adopted two children from 
Burrus Elementary School.  

The girl's name is Charmaine Holmes.  She is in the 4th grade and enjoys 
playing ball with her friends.  She hopes to be an actress when she grows 
up.  Her favorite story's to read are those by Beverly Cleary.

The boy's name is Alex Reymundo.  He is also in the 4th grade and likes to 
play football with his friends.  He hopes to be a police officer when he 
grows up.  His favorite series to read is Goosebumps.

Anyone who would like to participate in donating funds, please have your 
contributions to me by November 30th.  The estimated cost per child is 
$200.00.  Each individual who donates will be eligible for the drawing for 
the famous "Enron Kids" T-shirt.  

If you would like to volunteer to go shopping, gift wrap the gifts or take 
the gifts to the school, please see me by November 30th.

Thank you!
