Attached is the final draft (approved by Jim Fallon and Lynda Clemmons) of a 
follow-up letter to Commerce Secretary Daley from Ken Lay discussing Enron's 
concerns about weather data services provided by NOAA.

Since Ken Lay will be in the office tomorrow, should we have him sign it 
while he's here for delivery to Secretary Daley and cc's tomorrow?

Jeff
