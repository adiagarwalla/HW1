Per the attached memo from Mary Cook, an attorney in the Swap Group, and our 
meeting with members of Global Counterparty where we discussed problems with 
utilities of cities not being clearly identified, may I suggest the we rename 
GPP 98029, Norwich Public Utilities, something like, The City of Norwich, 
Connecticut?(which state?), by and through its Public Utilities Department.  
(The city utilities are at the bottom of the list.)

Stephanie, we will also need them to resubmit their PA.  Cheryl, we may need 
to confirm how we want to set this counterparty up before Stephanie send out 
the PA.





Cordially,
