SBX 28 (Sher), which would have established expedited siting procedures
among other things, failed passage on the Senate floor today where it
was up for concurrence.  Senate Republicans refused to vote for the bill
because it contained expanded unemployment insurance benefits which were
placed in the bill in the Assembly.  Assembly Republicans voted for the
provisions in exchange for other items in the bill.  Reconsideration was
granted and the bill could be heard by the Senate again as early as
Monday.
