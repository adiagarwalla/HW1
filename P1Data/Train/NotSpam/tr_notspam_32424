BPA short-term policy to encourage the use of small electric generation.

The Bonneville Power Administration hopes to establish a short-term policy to 
encourage the use of small electric generation to help the Northwest meet its 
needs during the current energy shortage. Before implementing the policy in 
June, BPA wants to hear from the public on the details of the plan. The 
policy will encourage the immediate addition of electricity generation to 
help the region until planned long-term generation can be built. While BPA 
will not fund the construction of the generators nor buy the output, the 
policy complements the load reduction strategy BPA has with its customers. 
Customers who reduce their load on BPA by 10 percent would be allowed to use 
temporary small generators to supply a small portion of their needs. BPA has 
asked its customers to reduce their demands on BPA so BPA can avoid expensive 
large power purchases in the wholesale market. Such purchases could lead to a 
triple-digit wholesale rate increase this October. The use of the small 
generators, along with other actions such as energy conservation, can help 
decrease reliance on BPA and thus help keep rates down. The generation plants 
would have to meet all applicable local, state and national regulations. The 
temporary policy would apply from June 1, 2001, through Sept. 30, 2002.
