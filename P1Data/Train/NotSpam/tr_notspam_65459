Here are the buy/sells we did after lunch.

Supply Deal Market Deal
153071  153057
153096  153135
153109  153109

The purchases are from CPA and the sells are to CES.  Originally these deals 
were done for the 21st, I just extended the date and the volumes through the 
24th.

Let me know if you have any questions.
