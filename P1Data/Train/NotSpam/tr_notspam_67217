Were we going to try and send off to GE today a revised draft of the contract 
which would include the language resulting from the tasks assigned in Peter's 
list?  

Re the list and those sections to which my name appears:

1.  Takeover - John have you revised the  text of Section 10.3.2 or should I 
take a shot at rewrite based on our discussions with GE on    Arcos.

4 and 11 Robust Scope/Change Orders - This issue has not been resolved and we 
are awaiting GE's proposal with respect to Arcos.

9   Warranty - Suggested wording has been provided to Peter.

11  Insurance - Section 19 dealing with insurance needs to be reviewed in 
light of recent discussions with insurance advisors to ensure    contract 
conforms with current insurance market conditions.
