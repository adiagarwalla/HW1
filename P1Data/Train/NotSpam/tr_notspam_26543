To All,

Attached to this message is a complete report on issues that are of concern 
to Enron.  

Below is a highlight version of the key issues contained in the report.  

FERC Seam Technical Conference report by Frank Afranji - Key message - 
Western RTOs, act now, act responsibly, if you don't FERC will do it for us 
and impose the PJM model
OASIS Phase II as reported by Jerry Dempsey - Key message - Western entities 
need to be more pro-active in attending and providing input to the NERC 
Electronic Scheduling Collaborative otheriwse they run the risk of NERC 
imposing standards which are not applicable to western RTO development.
Resource Adequacy - aka - Installed Capacity Markets.  NERC is considering 
California as an example of how the "Market" has failed to provide adequate 
generating resources to meet the needs of the region.  There are discussions 
now taking place to consider development of "Resource Adequacy" standards.
RTO Congestion Management Updates - When citing how DSTAR will align closly 
with RTO West's physical flow-path congestion management paradigm, Jerry 
Smith of APS publically corrected Mike Raezer and stated that on "Day-One" 
the DSTAR PTOs are implementing contract path.
West of Hatway - Rating decrease from 2800 to 2200, reasons and remidies 
along with possible new RAS requirements.
Path Connectivity Map - Does this idea make sense?  What would you like to 
see added? (Traders input requested)


If you have any questions, concerns or wish to be removed from the 
distribution list, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave
