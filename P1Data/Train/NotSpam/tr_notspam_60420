Dick bought some Agg gas from CNG Field Services Company - deal 143278.  
Kimat entered this as TCO pool deal.  The volume is currently 2187 dth per 
day.  Dick said this volume should increase tomorrow.

Robert, could you call CNG Field Services and get the upstream info?  They 
should give you an agg point - not the IPP pool.

Thanks
