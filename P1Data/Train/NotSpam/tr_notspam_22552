I think that the trailer we own in W.Va. (Aquila dock site) has a land lease with Aquila associated with it - Wayne - please confirm if this is correct.
 
Thanks.

Subject: IMPORTANT -- Enron Global Markets real estate leases



We need to pull together a list of all non-residential real estate leases for premises used by EGM and its businesses. 

To date, I have identified five such leases, listed below by address and landlord: 

(1) 2103 Southlake Blvd., Southlake, Texas (Comercis, Inc.) 
(2) 500 Lee Street East, Charleston, West Virginia (Laidley Developers Limited Partnership) 
(3) 780 Third Avenue, New York, New York (TIAA) 
(4) Penn Center West, Bldg Two, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania (Penn Center Management Corp.) 
(5) 150 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, IL  60601 (BfG Immobilien-Investment Gesellschaft mbH Ltd.) 

Please let me know ASAP if you are aware of ANY leased premises held or used by EGM or its related businesses that is not on the above list.  While all of the above leases are office leases, we need a complete list of ALL non-residential real estate leases (including warehouse leases, land leases, etc.).  Please be overinclusive in responding to this information request, as I am including premises that EGM shares with other Enron business units and is charged an allocation.

Thank you all for your attention to and cooperation with this important information request -- Bob Bruce
