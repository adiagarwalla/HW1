SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), which would have established a windfall profits tax,
failed passage on the Assembly floor last night on a vote of 27-28.  The
bill needed 41 votes to pass.  Among those voting "no" was Assembly Member
Ellen Corbett who authored the Assembly version of the windfall profits tax,
ABX2 2, which failed passage on the Assembly floor the other night.  Both
bills were granted reconsideration which means they could be heard today,
although the likelihood of passage remains slim.
