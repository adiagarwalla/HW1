Ben or Ron

Please provide the horsepower requirement for the Sun Devil Project at the various load factor on the attached spreadsheet (hplf).  We need to be able to see what impact Sun Devil has after Red Rock in the event the California load decline below 1240 MMbtu/day or Arizonia load are not at the 750 MMBtu/day levels.  Need information as soon as you can provide it.

Thanks,
James
