Allyson,

You should receive some formation documents relating to Edgecombe 
Development.  The name is not spelled correctly (missing an "e"), but that is 
being corrected at this time.  

 Bob spoke to me about wanting Enron to send a letter concerning the 
financing arrangements for the project.  I would like for us to discuss this 
as well.

Kay
