Dawne,

The options should go to NG-PR-OPT, but the underlying swap should continue 
be between NG-Price and NG-Exotic.

Thanks,

Errol

With this new book, you want the option to go to NG-PR-OPT (it is going to 
NG-PRICE now) and the underlying swap to be between NG-PRICE and NG-PR-OPT?

Please confirm!

Dawn

Dawne,

Starting tommorrow, Mike's options need to be booked to NG-PR-OPT.  The deals 
that are done online today will be manually switched to the new book by us.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin
