This year we will be having our Christmas Dinner at the Cadillac Bar & 
Grill.  We have reserved the back room for our group.  Everyone will need to 
provide their own transportation because........ we aren't coming back to 
work that day!  We should try to leave around 2:00pm to be there by 2:30pm.  
We will also be having a "White Elephant" gift exchange.  If you choose to 
buy a present, $10.00 is the limit you should spend or you can bring an item 
from home, just make sure that the items are gift-wrapped.  For those that 
have never participated in a "White Elephant" gift exchange, I will be 
forwarding the rules on Monday.  I also have a copy of the menu at my desk if 
anyone would like to see it.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Nicole
