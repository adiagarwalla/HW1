El Paso Natural Gas issued an emergency notice Monday, reporting that the 
Bondad 2A turbine must be taken down to repair an oil leak today. The work 
will reduce the capacity of the station by 95 MMcf/d. El Paso also said Line 
1200 and 1201 are being "Smart Pigged" this week on Sept. 19, 21 and 24, 
causing a reduction of 40 MMcf/d of San Juan Basin capacity. If you have 
questions, call Mario Montes at (915) 496-2617.
