Good afternoon,

I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There 
are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. 

Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have 
sent this out without the usual internal review.

We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.

Talk to you soon,

Kay
