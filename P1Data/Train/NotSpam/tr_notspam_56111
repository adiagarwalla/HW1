To All:

Attached is a credit worksheet to amend the counterparty threshold amount for 
this executed ISDA.  I sent a similar e-mail up to the group 4/17, but have 
since amended the threshold a second time.

Please use this worksheet to prepare the appropriate amendment language.

Thank you,

Russell
