Jim/Diomedes:  Attached is an ESA Communication Plan for 2001.  Its goals, 
programs and outcomes are based on having the PR function provide "bottom 
line" support to the business units' operating targets.  The costs for the 
Plan's programs are reflected in the PR budgets for Argentina, Brazil and 
Houston that were submitted in September.   Regards, Keith
