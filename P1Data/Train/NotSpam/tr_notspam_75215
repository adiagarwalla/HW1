This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will send it 
shortly.

Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region
of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a
little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.

Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas
began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black
Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking,
loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region.
One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a
master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he
felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He
was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in
Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy
Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife
and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast
of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and
spirit.

The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a
pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a
parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As
he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in
light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such
wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see
the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he
happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red
with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my
words of course):

The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for
our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around
(all the other trees loose their leaves and "die") but only the evergreen
goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the
Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.

The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon
that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.

The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure
through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the
Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He
said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.

As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of
the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to
a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center
with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until
Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when
the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when
gifts are usually exchanged.

While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating
all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and
maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the
season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a "color theme" or mix and
match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your
home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's
pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved
friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have
unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray

"Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine
through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place
in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that
gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your
covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open
a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the
keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your
Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was
raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person
You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each
one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a
sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown
and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on
the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the
lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me.
Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing,
dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my
arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I
ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!"

Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real
difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our
hearts.

I love you all....Carol Word
