Leave this to the UDCs -- we are also OK with the penalty.  The main problem 
for the ISO operators is the lack of resources being scheduled day-ahead, so 
I think we should be OK with that penalty.

We have discovered another problem that we may want to discuss in our oral 
comments, although the UDCs may cover it.  Even though the FERC removes the 
forward market prohibition, the UDCs will not be in the forward market 
because: (1) the PUC may find they were imprudent and (2) the FERC's penalty 
is only for underscheduling load in the day-ahead or the day-of market, not 
for load failing to be hedged in the forward market.
