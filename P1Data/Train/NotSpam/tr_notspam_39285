Attached is the 2000 BRM Risk Universe.  We've uploaded the Universe to the 
BRM System under the "BRM Info" tab.  Due to changes in risk areas and target 
activities within the Universe, the BRM System will require some minor 
changes for inputting our 2000 audit plans.  We should have this completed 
within the next 2 weeks.  Also, definitions for the new target activities are 
forthcoming and will be uploaded to the "BRM Info" tab within the next week 
or so.
