Charlene,
I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer 
interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.

In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal
resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.

Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.

Vince
