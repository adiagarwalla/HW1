Breathitt wants more attention on Calif. gas
Although the energy spotlight has been on California=01,s electricity crisi=
s,=20
the number of California
gas issues at FERC is continually increasing, signaling the need to focus o=
n=20
the gas
side of the equation, a FERC commissioner said last week.
=01&[T]here is volatility in the gas markets as well as the electric market=
s,=018=20
FERC Commissioner
Linda Breathitt said at the American Gas Association=01,s FERC Natural Gas=
=20
Regulatory
and Market Issues Seminar last week in Washington, D.C. And the cost of gas=
,=20
she said, is the
component that has the biggest influence on the cost of electric generation=
.
Two issues pending at FERC are whether to re-impose price caps on secondary=
=20
market
transactions and whether to cap prices on gas sales, Breathitt said.

In addition, FERC recently issued an order to help remove obstacles to=20
increased energy
supplies into the West (GD 3/15). In the order, FERC sought comments on the=
=20
need to provide
rate incentives for projects that would make additional capacity available =
by=20
this summer on
constrained pipeline systems. =01&I believe that if the commission does pro=
vide=20
incentives, we
should be very precise regarding the activity we are encouraging and the=20
incentives we will be
willing to consider, if at all,=018 Breathitt said.

The commissioner also voiced concern over a California issue that sits at t=
he=20
state level -
intrastate pipeline facilities. California, she said, needs to assess wheth=
er=20
its intrastate system is
adequate to take gas from the border to its market. =01&I am worried that w=
here=20
there is insufficient takeaway capacity, FERC=01,s actions to increase capa=
city=20
to the border may result in problems,such as prorationing,=018 Breathitt sa=
id.

Meanwhile, Breathitt suggested local distribution companies in California=
=20
need the ability
to use risk management tools. Policies should be in place to give gas buyer=
s=20
an incentive to use such tools, including price hedging and the efficient u=
se=20
of storage, she said.

But regulators should be careful in noting the difference between hedging t=
o=20
reduce exposure
to price volatility and what Breathitt called =01&mere speculating.=018 Whi=
le=20
hedging can be
used to decrease uncertainty, speculating to beat the market can actually=
=20
increase the possibility
of risk, she said.

Regulators in California and other states should look into the benefits of=
=20
reducing gas buyers=01,
dependence on the spot market. =01&A balanced portfolio of long- and short-=
term=20
contracts makes a
great deal of sense when spot prices are at the extreme levels of the past=
=20
year,=018 she said.=20
