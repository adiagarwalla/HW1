We've had a change of plans:  Contrary to our earlier conversation today, do not deliver to Santa Clara at COB in January.

Confidentially, we are planning to terminate Santa Clara's contract soon.  Do not tell Santa Clara this.

I'll be out Friday.  If you have any questions regarding this, please call Harlan Murphy.
