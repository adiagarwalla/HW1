> Today's hearing of the Select Committee to Investigation Price
> Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market was canceled.  In it's
> place, Senator Dunn held a press conference where he announced the
> following:
>
> The next hearing will take place on May 18 at 9:00 a.m. at the Irvine
> City Council Chambers in Southern California.  There will be three
> witnesses; Elaine Howle - Bureau of State Audits, Loretta Lynch - CPUC
> and Bob Pease - Legal Director - FERC.  The hearing is expected to last
> all day.
>
> The following hearing will take place in Sacramento on May 24.  That
> hearing will feature witnesses from the PX.
>
> The Committee has retained Larry Drivon as Special Counsel.  Mr. Drivon
> is a civil practitioner from Stockton.
>
> The Committee is expanding its investigation in conjunction with local
> district attorneys.  Their goal is to create a statewide task force.
> The Committee may not be able to enlist the aid of the Attorney General
> as there are certain prohibitions in law which apparently stand in their
> way.  To date, the only DA conducting an investigation is from San
> Jouqin County.  The basis for their investigation is price fixing, theft
> of public funds and anti-trust violations.  The DA is offering immunity
> in exchange for testimony.
>
> The Committee has distributed data requests to the top five generators
> and Enron.  They intend to issue more data requests to marketers in the
> coming weeks.  The Committee is meeting with generators at 2:30 p.m.
> today to review the data request and determine what data the generators
> may be willing to submit.  The Committee intends to issue subpoenas to
> obtain certain documents which the generators may not willingly
> provide.  The Committee has subpoenaed the ISO who is expected to
> release documents on May 7.  Some generators have expressed concern that
> the ISO documents are protected under confidentiality agreements.
>
> According to the Committee, upon cursory review of the public documents
> they have already obtained, it does appear as if suspicious, if not
> illegal, activity has occurred on the part of the generators and
> marketers.
