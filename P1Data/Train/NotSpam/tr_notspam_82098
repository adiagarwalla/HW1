---------------

Try to attend both meetings....you'll be glad you did!  These meetings will 
be conducted by Captain Herb Evers of the Bellevue Police Department.  Herb 
has a B.A. in Criminal Justice and is a graduate of the F.B.I. National 
Academy.  Are you ready for "SURVIVAL KNOWLEDGE FOR THE WORKPLACE?"  Think 
about it.  Do you know what to do if confronted by an armed assailant?  Do 
you know when most residential burglaries occur?  In a study of 22,000 woman, 
who were victims of an attack, what was it that 2 out of 3 did that allowed 
them to escape?  Where on the human body are the most vulnerable areas of 
pain and compliance?  

These and other highly important life saving factors will be covered in the 
safety meetings.  You will be participating in HANDS ON learning.........how 
to escape from an attack, how to safely leave a room without being 
assaulted.  THIS IS NOT A MARTIAL ARTS CLASS!    The instructions are very 
simple and you will learn easy-to-remember tactics which will be provided to 
KEEP YOU SAFE!

               QUARTERLY SAFETY MEETING   Room #227             2 P.M.

   
Remember to dress casually for the HANDS-ON Meeting on August 22.

P.S.  Should we tell him the "glazed donut" joke?
