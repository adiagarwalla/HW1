A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA 
concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater 
than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of 
responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput 
criteria, please provide to me the following:


 tank name/serial number

 tank size

 average daily throughput

Thanks for your help in this matter....
