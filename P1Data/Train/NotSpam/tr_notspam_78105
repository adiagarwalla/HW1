Jeanne,

Looks great.  I don't have any changes.

I like your characterization of the "bond cap" issue Pat and I mentioned this 
morning.  My bet is that, ultimately, this will drive the CPUC to increase 
the CPA.  Once the legislators figure out that the general fund will not be 
fully reimbursed if the bond issue is less than $10 billion, they will put 
pressure on the CPUC to make sure the CPA is as large as possible.

Steve
