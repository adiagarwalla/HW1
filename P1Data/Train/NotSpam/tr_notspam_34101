Most of you already know, but the move is taking place this Friday 11/16/01.  Please be sure you are packed by 3:00 PM on Friday and  have everything labeled.  They are moving both Power and Gas, so I am not sure what time the building will be open on Sunday or if it will be open at all.  I will get back to you with that information by Thursday.  If you have any questions or need help with anything, please let me know.

Thanks!
Ina
