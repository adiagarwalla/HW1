>  TRIBUTE TO THE UNITED STATES > >
> This, from a  Canadian newspaper, is worth sharing.  America: The Good
>  Neighbor.  Widespread but only partial news coverage was given
>  recently to a remarkable editorial broadcast from  Toronto by  Gordon
> Sinclair, a Canadian television  commentator. What follows  is the full
> text of his trenchant remarks as printed in the  Congressional
> Record:  "This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up  for the
> Americans as the most generous and possibly the  least  appreciated people
> on all the earth.  Germany, Japan and, to  alesser extent, Britain and
> Italy were
> lifted out of the debris  of warby the  Americans who poured in billions of
> dollars
>  and > forgave other billions in debts. None of these  countries is  today
> paying even
> the interest on its  remaining debts to  the United States.  When  France
> was in
> danger of  collapsing in 1956,  it was the Americans who propped it up, and
>  their
> reward was to be insulted and swindled on the  streets   of Paris. I was
> there. I saw it.
> When earthquakes hit distant  cities, it is the  United States that hurries
> in to help.
>  This spring,  59  American communities were flattened by  tornadoes.
Nobody
> helped.   The Marshall Plan and the  Truman Policy pumped  billions of
> dollars into discouraged
>  countries. Now  newspapers in those countries are writing about the
>  decadent, warmongering Americans.  I'd like to see just one of  those
> countries that  is gloating
> over the erosion of the  United States dollar build its own airplane. Does
> any  other
>  country > in the world have a plane to equal the Boeing  Jumbo > Jet, the
> Lockheed
> Tri-Star, or the Douglas  DC10?  If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all
> the   International lines except Russia fly American  Planes?  Why does  no
> other land on earth even consider  putting  a man or woman  on the moon?
You
> talk about Japanese  technocracy, and you get  radios. You talk about
> German  technocracy, and you get
>  automobiles.  You talk about American technocracy, and you find men on  the
> moon -
> not once, but several times - and safely home  again.   You talk about
> scandals, and the Americans put   theirs right in the store window for
> everybody to look at .  Even  their
> draft-dodgers are not pursued and  hounded.  They are  here on our streets,
> and most
> of them,  unless  they  are breaking Canadian laws,
> are getting  American  dollars  from ma and pa at home to spend here.
> When the railways of France,  Germany and India  were breaking down through
> age,
> it was  the Americans  who rebuilt them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and
>  the New
> York Central went broke, nobody loaned them  an  old  caboose.  Both are
> still broke.
> I can name you 5000 times  when the Americans raced  to the help of other
> people in trouble.  Can you name  me even one time when someone else raced
> to the   Americans in trouble?  I don't think there was
> outside  help  even during the San Francisco earthquake.  Our neighbors
have
>  faced it alone, and I'm one  Canadian who is damned tired of hearing  them
> get  kicked around.  They will come out of this
>  thing with  their flag high. And when they do, they are entitled  to  thumb
> their nose at the lands that are gloating  over their present  troubles. I
> hope Canada is not  one of  those."
> Stand  proud, America!
>
>  This is one of the best editorials that I  have ever  read regarding the
> United States. It is nice that one  man realizes it. I only wish that the
> rest of  the  world  would realize it. We are always blamed for
everything,
> and never even  get a thank you for the  things we do.  I would hope that
> each  of you  would send this to  as many people as you can and  emphasize
> that they should send it to as many of their friends  until  this  letter
is
> sent to every person on the web. I  am just  a  single American that
> has read this, I SURE HOPE  THAT  A  LOT MORE READ IT SOON.    ---
