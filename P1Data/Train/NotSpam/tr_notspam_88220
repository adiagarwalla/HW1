  You can find detailed explanation in attached files.
  It  is highly recommended for you to send your response  by e-mail (appro=
ve=20

  because of the possible change of interest rate.
  If  there  is  any  objection  on this item from Board members, we will s=

  Sincerely Yours,

  K.R. Choi
