> 
> The priest says, "What do you mean almost?" 
> 
> The man says, "Well, we got undressed and rubbed
> together but 
> then I stopped." 
> 
> The priest replies, "Rubbing together is the same as
> putting it 
> in. You're not to go near that woman again, now say
> five Hail 
> Marys and put $50 in the poor box." 
> 
> The man leaves confessional, goes over and says his
