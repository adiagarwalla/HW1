Sorry guys, I missed a change. The TCO capacity going to BG&E (19,293/d) was
added to the Exhibit for the first quarter of 2000. The new file is attached.

Subject: Retail Exhibit Revision 1-13-00

I have revised Exhibit 1 of the retail supply agreement pursuant to our 
meeting
last week. Two changes were made:

 1)  Tennessee Zone 6 premium for 1/2000 was corrected to +.06.
 2) Volume requirements for Choice programs with storage were
reduced in most cases to account for storage gas being withdrawn. These are 
the
final volumes.
