While the Purchase and Sale Agreement has not yet settled down, we would like 
to have the Schedules as complete as possible to date.  We would appreciate 
your submitting any remaining additions, deletions or corrections to the 
Schedules no later than noon on Monday.  Thanks for all the help.  Lance.
