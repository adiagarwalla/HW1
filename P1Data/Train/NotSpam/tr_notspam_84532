Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking abou=
t over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest an=
d the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next =
weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet a=
nother trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) w=
ith the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Mi=
dwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to muc=
h above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for m=
ost of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast=
 mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest. =20

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm tod=
ay.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc//=
   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "e=
nron", Password is "".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the d=
ay tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm=
 the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlik=
ely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer=
 picture for the East.* =20

Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
