This is a message from Kerry. 

I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He 
uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected 
(logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a 
message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was 
"Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.  

Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW 

Thanks,

Kerry
