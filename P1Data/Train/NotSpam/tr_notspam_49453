One note: recall that with respect to market manipulation, one of the most
common accusations focused on the problems caused by the PX manipulation
the utilities engaged in thanks to their monopsony (demand-side bidding)
market power.

Steve Kean will be testifying at the Senate Energy Committee's hearing on
Wednesday regarding California.  Steve and Jim Steffes asked me to contact
you for the following information.  I've listed specific requests for
several people, but am copying many more of you for your input as well.
Anything you can provide by sometime on Monday will be appreciated!

Dave Parquet - Siting of new power plants in California.  Any insight you
can provide regarding the rules, the current climate, what would fix the
current situation, etc.

Richard Sanders - Steve thinks he might be asked about whether the market
was manipulated.  Please provide information on whether this was the case
and who the participants likely were.  What's the current climate regarding
sanctions, etc.?

Mary Schoen - Any information you can provide relating to air emission
issues in California, and specific details for our recommendations
regarding air emissions.

Steve Walton - The status on RTO West, Desert Star, Cal ISO and general
information on RO development.

Sue Mara - Specific ordering language requiring the utilities to buy only
from the PX.  Was it required through legislation or the CPUC, and what
exactly does it mean.  Who was involved in formulating the language?
Information on block forward markets.

Alan Comnes - A copy of the CDWR response and anything they might have
available regarding long term proposals from the government.

Dan Allegretti - We have the e-mail Jim sent regarding the UI deal.  Please
provide more specifics on the deal, and information regarding portfolio
management approach.

Thanks for your help!
