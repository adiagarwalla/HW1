The attached is a pretty decent summary of the recent U.S. Supreme Court's 
opinion on the Clean Water Act's juridictional reach to isolated waters.   
Thought it might be of interest to origination/developer type lawyers.

		 Subject: Analysis of the Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 SWANCC Decision


Attached is a brief memo prepared by Van Ness Feldman analyzing the U.S. 
Supreme Court's January 9, 2001 decision in the case of Solid Waste Agency of 
Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (No. 99-1178 (U.S. 
January 9, 2001)).  By a vote of 5 to 4, the Court determined that "isolated" 
waters (often wetlands) are not subject to regulation under the Clean Water 
Act (and the Section 404 permitting program).  This decision has significant 
implications for anyone who is, or will be engaging in the construction of 
generating facilities, transmission lines, factories, houses, pipelines, or 
similar projects.

Van Ness Feldman will be providing our friends and clients with periodic 
updates on breaking legal and legislative activity throughout the remainder 
of 2001.  If you would like to be removed from this distribution list, please
