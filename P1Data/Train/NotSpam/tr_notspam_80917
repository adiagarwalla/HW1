Dan, please admend the contract for 2800 a day at $2.00 (this deal ends 
12/31/01).  I have blended and extended this deal and the new price is $3.155 
beginning 6/1/01 through the new term of 6/30/02.  This sale is at Temple 
Inland.

Thanks

P.S. ( Ed and Lauri, even though this was only a 6 month deal I was able to 
get $.015)
