In the past few months, there have been protests at various Enron offices.  
These protests have been primarily by consumer and other advocacy groups 
representing different energy interests.  Attached are security and public 
relations procedures to help you manage a protest should one arise at your 
facility.  Feel free to provide this document to leaders in your organization 
as appropriate.

Thank You.
