Thanks to all for helping to evaluate and come to an agreement on this project. Maybe sometime later we'll get another chance to look at it .

Subject:	La Plata to Bloomfield Drag Reducing Agent Application Evaluation - No Go

The economic evaluation of applying drag reducing agent to the La Plata to Bloomfield line indicates it is not justified.  Tracy indicated that if the launchers and receivers were installed as a part of the pipeline integrity program, the incremental cost of DRA application may then be economically beneficial.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this effort.
