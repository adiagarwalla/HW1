An incident just occurred of which you should be aware.

One of our employees received a call from a person (aka: Jennifer Lewis) claiming to be with Enron's HR department working on a task for Robert Jones.  She requested information about employees, their names, and addresses.  "Jennifer" claimed that she had information that needed to be sent to our team per Robert.  She had an old list of employees as she named several employees who are no longer with the company.  She then requested to be faxed a list of our current employees and their addresses.  The fax number given was a Houston number, but with different prefixes than the Enron numbers.

Obviously, this individual was fraudulent and was requesting confidential information.  If any of you receive a call requesting any information about our employees, their addresses, or even asking to confirm if an employee still works at Enron, do not answer their questions.  Please refer these calls to me immediately and I will handle their inquires.  

If you have any questions or need other information, please let me know.  Thank you.
