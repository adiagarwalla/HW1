Ladies and Gentlemen,

Stinson just pointed out that I forgot to mention that the meeting is 
scheduled for tomorrow (10th of March 2000) between 2:30 PM and 4:30 PM.  It 
may seem like a very short notice; however, we (Mark, Mary, Kara, Mike, 
Virawan and myself) had initially set this time and date last week.  In the 
future I will make sure that everyone is notified early.  Sorry for any 
inconvenience this may have caused.  Thank you.

Shalesh Ganjoo
