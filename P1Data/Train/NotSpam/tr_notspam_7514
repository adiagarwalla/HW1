Bob -

I've edited our numbers a bit on the Azurix analysis and would like you to 
re-run the joint probabilities tables.

Please note that I've got 2 cases in the model now - an optimistic case and a 
pessimistic case.  I hope you can run both cases.  (you will need to toggle 
for case 1 or 2 - real complicated stuff!!)

Please keep everything else the same (ie, the currency probabilities, RAB 
probabilities, etc.)

Thanks for your help.
