FERC has not yet issued on the list of panel participants for the November 9 
conference, but we will circulate it as soon as it is posted on FERC's web 
site.  I did speak to Julie Simon at EPSA, however, and she told me that 
based on calls she has received all day from EPSA members, that it looks like 
FERC is mixing up the panels so that they will not be put together by market 
participant class.    Julie has heard that each panel will have approximately 
6 people, and each person will be given 5 minutes to make a presentation.  
Each panel will have 90 minutes total, so FERC is probably planning on having 
a significant dialogue with each panel after formal comments are made.

Also, Scott Miller called Julie today and told her that FERC is feeling 
somewhat beleaguered by industry response to the California order.  FERC 
feels that they issued a good order for marketers and generators, and they 
would like to hear positive responses from market participants at the meeting 
on Thursday and in the written comments on November 22.  We of course will be 
expected to state our positions, but Scott asked that we (EPSA members) 
temper our comments and recognize and praise FERC for the bold action it took 
in the order (on things like governance, buy/sell requirement, etc.) in 
addition to raising our concerns about the price mitigation measures.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  We'll let you know as soon as 
we get the order for the November 9 meeting.
