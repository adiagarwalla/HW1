Re:     Extension of time for discovery letter

Judge Downes' law clerk called to report that Judge Downes did not intend to 
impose such scheduling duress on the Grynberg and Wright groups seeking to 
coordinate on a discovery letter, so is granting us until the close of 
business on Thursday to submit a coordinated letter reply.   A draft reply is 
in process and should be circulated early tomorrow with requests for your 
prompt feedback.   Don.
