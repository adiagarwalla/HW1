We're trying to get a demo setup - probably for lunch time one day this week. 

 In the meantime, you can view the homepage at 
http://test.entelligence..com  

Security will prevent you from going any further until you have been setup.  
If you wish to gain access, please submit a request through erequest at 
http://itc.corp..com.  Currently, you can only request test access.  
Production access should be added later this week.
