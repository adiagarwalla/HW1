We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I 
will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate 
from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get 
the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.
