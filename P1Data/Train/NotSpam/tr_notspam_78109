My house is finally ready for its first party!  Please join me for some 
cocktails, finger foods, music, and overall good spirits!

It's going to be Saturday, May 19 starting anytime after 6:00PM until Sunday 
7:30AM.  (That's when I go to church.)  May 19 is not this weekend.  It's 
next weekend.

I'll have a mix a domestic beers (including light), with some hard liquor, 
soft drinks, vegetable tray, and munchies.  (Feel free to bring any 
'specialized' booze that you may desire.)  Join in me in the fun!  Bring a 
friend.

Please RSVP so I can get an idea of how of you rapscallions will show up.  
Email me or call me at the phone numbers at the bottom.


What? Party at Mike's townhouse

Why?  Any of the following reasons:
   The start of spring
   Celebration of your tax refunds
   To meet Moz and Josie, my 89-year old neighbor
   It'll be a great time

Where? On Bellefontaine Street, just South of the intersection of Buffalo 
Speedway and Holcombe.     (Holcombe is the same street as Bellaire.)

Address? 3200 Bellefontaine   #72   (Zip: 77025)
