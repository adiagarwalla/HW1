The attached file is an updated version of the one that I sent a few minutes
ago of the same name.   The changes are minor and are as follows:

*In the Daily Chg worksheet, the intraday change on BGE of +303 is all on
Choice+DCQ.  The original had 40 dth of the increase on Choice +DCQ and the
remaining 263 on EU 164, which was not correct.  No changes were made to the
volumes in the Total Reqs. worksheet which were correct in the original
version.

Sorry for any inconvenience.
