Vince:

Please send an email to:  iBuyit@.com   stating that you are approver
of invoices as requested in the email below.  We cannot purchase anything
until you do.

iBuyit Payables Approvers
We need your help to identify future iBuyit Approvers.  Please encourage the 
people that approve your invoices to identify themselves as future iBuyit 
users by sending an email with their name, e-mail address, and whether they 
code or approve invoices to <<mailto:iBuyit@.com>>.  On-line materials 
for approvers will be available beginning next week via the Integrated 
Solution Center Document Library at <
http://sap..com/sap_doclib/user/default.asp>.  Materials will include an 
overview of the system and step-by-step instructions.  Identified approvers 
will receive an e-mail with links to these materials next week.

Thanks!


Shirley
