  Could you please let me know the percentages/amounts of time you spent on 
East Coast Power in February.

Mary Perkins - could you please forward the number of transactions and 
accounts.

Jason Chumley, Tai Nguyen and Sean Sargent - could you please forward the 
number of contractor hours and remote support hours.

It is important that we get this information ASAP so we can bill East Coast 
Power for your time.

Thanks,
