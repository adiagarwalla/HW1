FERC has two meetings in July (July 11 and 25) and then is on recess for the month of August.  The next FERC meeting after July will not be held until September 12.  Consequently, FERC tries to get out as many orders as it can in July so the backlog is not as great in September.  

Consistent with that goal, FERC has included a lot of cases on its July 11 agenda.   While some of these cases may be stricken from the agenda for July 11(and either deferred to the July 25 meeting or until September), we are still expecting a lot of action from FERC in July.  The following cases are on FERC's July 11 agenda:

RTO Proceedings

Alliance RTO

SPP and Entergy RTOs

PJM and PJM West RTOs

New York RTO

New England RTO

RTO West

Southern RTO

Two new RTO dockets entitled "Regional Transmission Organizations"

Other Proceedings

Mirant vs. ISO New England (June 20, 2001 complaint by Mirant regarding ISO's proposal to revise procedures for mitigation of generators run out of economic merit order during transmission constraints).

NYSEG v. NYISO (regarding ISO's hybrid fixed block pricing rule)

NERC (these are old docket numbers that go back to orders issued in 1999 regarding TLR -- Southern and VEPCO sought rehearing of the TLR procedures in June, 1999, arguing that they could result in shedding load.  FERC may be responding to those rehearing requests).

HQ v. NYISO (regarding HQ's request for FERC to order ISO to reinstate the May 8, 2000 market clearing price)

Maine PUC vs. New England ISO (regarding the PUC's complaint against the NE ISO asking FERC to direct the ISO to recalculate the energy clearing price on May 8, 2000).

California Proceedings

San Diego Gas & Electric v. Sellers (Docket No. EL00-95-038 -- several parties have already sought rehearing of the June 19 order -- this could be a non-substantive tolling order (putting on hold these requests for rehearing), or it could be something more substantive.

Removing Obstacles to Increased Electric Generation and Natural Gas Supply in the Western United States

Please let me know if you have any questions concerning these proceedings.
