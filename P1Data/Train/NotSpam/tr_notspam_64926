Thank you for signing up to attend the JDF Kick-off Luncheon and for agreeing 
to be a team leader for our campaign this year. 

I look forward to seeing each of you at the luncheon tomorrow, Wednesday, 
September 6th, at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in the Imperial Ballroom at 11:30 
a.m.  Enron has reserved several tables, so be sure to join us at one of our 
tables.  

Again, my sincerest thanks for your commitment to JDF and our campaign.  See 
you tomorrow.

Mike

By now all of you should have received an invitation to the JDF 2000 Walk to 
Cure Diabetes Kick-Off Luncheon on Wednesday, September 6th, 11:30 a.m. - 
1:00 p.m. at the Hyatt Regency Hotel.  I would like to take this opportunity 
to personally invite and encourage each of you to attend and join me as we 
represent Enron at this important meeting.

Our plan is to reserve several tables at the luncheon just for Enron.  
Whether you have received an invitation or not, I would like for each of you 
to make plans to join us at the luncheon.  In order to reserve sufficient 
seats at the luncheon (and even if you have already made a reservation with 
the JDF office) please send a brief Lotus Notes message to Cathy Phillips or 
call her at X-36898 to let her know if we may plan on your attendance.

I look forward to seeing you at the luncheon and working with you on the fun 
and exciting JDF campaign that we have planned for this year.  Thank you.

Mike McConnell
