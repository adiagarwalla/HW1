Carl Carter and myself are working with Colleen Sullivan to get Pipeline 
Secondary Capacity launched on EnronOnline.  I just want to touch base with 
you regarding the GTC and Product Descriptions.
Gerald, according to our conversation you should have a draft early this 
week, please let me know where we stand so we are sure that it fits into 
EnronOnline structure so we can input some draft wording/structure into Test 
and start creating Products
Please let me know if you have any questions/comments
Thanks

Carlos
