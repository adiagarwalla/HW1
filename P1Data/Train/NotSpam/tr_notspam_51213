Attached is a memo from Beth Tilney regarding the new P&D (Participation and 
Dissent) program, as proposed by the Vision and Values Task Force.  

Please take a minute to consider issues within your groups that might be 
appropriate for a P&D pilot.  We would like to host several pilots within ENA 
in the next week or so if at all possible and need your help in doing so.  

I would be happy to provide more details or answer questions about the P&D 
process.  Please don't hesitate to contact me.  My extension is 3-9964.

Thank you,
Elisabeth McCabe
