IF ANYONE RECEIVES THIS THAT SHOULD NOT DUE TO PIPELINE CHANGES, PLEASE LET

I will be happy to also send it email.  I haven't in the past but will do so 
from now on.

I received a fax from you today regarding the Keystone Plant Tailgate
volumes for March.  I was
wondering if you forward this via e-mail as well.  I don't always receive
faxes on a timely basis and I'm
not sure the appropriate scheduler always receives the information.  Please
let me know.

Thanks,
Beverly
