I will need to leave at 4:30 pm on Wed and Thurs this week, 10/25 & 10/26.

I have a Dr. appt at 9:30 on Friday a.m.  I should be in by noon.


Brenda,

Can Gloria sit at my desk Friday morning?  I don't think a clerk will be 
adequate coverage.  There's a good chance Ann Elizabeth will have some word 
processing work to be done.  

Taffy
