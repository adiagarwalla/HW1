Stephanie,

In conjunction with the recent movement of several power traders, they are 
changing the names of their gas books as well.  The names of the new gas 
books and traders are as follows:

PWR-NG-LT-SPP:  Mike Carson
PWR-NG-LT-SERC:  Jeff King

If you need to know their power desk to map their ID to their gas books, 
those desks are as follows:

EPMI-LT-SPP:  Mike Carson
EPMI-LT-SERC:  Jeff King

I will be in training this afternoon, but will be back when class is over.  
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for your help!
Casey
