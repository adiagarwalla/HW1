Here are two versions of the direct access language.  The first one is the
more heaviliy edited version suggested by AES's lobbyist, with our changes.

 <<X23041.DOC>>



The second one is our original edits which just insert language in the bill
and try to avoid wholesale changes in the language.
The only real difference in the bills is that the AES version specifies 5%
market share for core in year one and 2% more each year thereafter (which we
know DWR will oppose), while our version specifies that core can have at
least the same amount of load growth and therefore room to elect DA service
as the load growth from last year, and that negative load growth cannot
reduce the DA market for residentials.

Bev, please tell me which version you gave to whom.  I also have versions
without the redlining if you want them.  I am still working on the
comparison document.  Thanks, Mike
