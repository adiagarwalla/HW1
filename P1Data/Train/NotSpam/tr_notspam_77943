Hi Diann--

Ideally I would like to finalize the declarations today so that we can spend 
tomorrow focusing on the brief.  However, tomorrow would be ok, if you can't 
get to it today.

Bill

Mike, there are several comments in Natividad's Declaration that I would like 
to
revise.  Maurice Winter is currently reviewing it for accuracy on the meter
aspects.  When do you need this?

Subject:  Declarations

Attached are my comments to all declarations.  For the most part they look
great.

I have no comments on Navidad's (the metering expert)--but I ask Evan and 
Diann
to review for accuracy.  I would also like Peggy and Jeff to review very
carefully Dennis' declaration--there are several direct statements about our
hedging strategy and our financial losses under the UCCSU K that will become
public.  We either need to be comfortable with these statements or tone them
down.  This is very important.

Please send me any comments.  MDS
