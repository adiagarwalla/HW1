The latest customer satisfaction report by Mastio & Co. finds CMS Energy on 
top among 68 of the nation's marketers in areas such as reliability, price 
and ease of business.


Mastio surveyed 1,200 industrials, local distribution companies, electric 
generators, independent power producers, marketers and producers for the 
report, ranking the marketers on 39 customer satisfaction attributes.


The top 20, in order, are: CMS, Reliant, Williams, TXU Energy Trading , Enron 
North America, Southern Co. Energy Marketing , Conoco, Oneok, TransCanada, El 
Paso Energy Marketing , Aquila Energy, PanCanadian Energy Services, BP, Duke 
Energy Trading , Dynegy Marketing & Trade, Exxon Mobil Gas Marketing , Coral 
Energy Resources, Sempra Energy Trading and Koch Energy Trading .


Of those, Reliant Energy had the highest two-year average, while Koch Energy 
Trading had the lowest two-year average. Enron North America and Texaco Gas 
Marketing showed the greatest improvement, while Sempra and Koch showed the 
most significant decline. A total of 43 marketers improved their scores, 
while 27 declined. This is the fourth such index for marketers from St. 
Joseph, Mo.-based Mastio.


"Many marketers focus on the niche customers while ignoring their core 
customers," noted Bart Thedinger, vice president/senior partner of Mastio & 
Co.
