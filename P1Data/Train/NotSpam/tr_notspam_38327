Louise Kitchen, who is now the President & CEO of Enron Net Works and I had a 
conversation about the space located at EB2801.  Louise had no objection to 
RAC occupying this space since her buildout could not occur until May.   The 
space rental should be allocated to 011/100068 and 011/100052 equally.
