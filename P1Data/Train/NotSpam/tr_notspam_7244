Good Morning All!

I have just spoken with Cheryl.  In an effort to keep from getting others 
sick, she has informed me that she will be staying home today.  She has a 
doctor's appointment Thursday, but is trying to get a sooner visit for 
today.  If there is anything I can assist you with, I will be happy to do 
so.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Regards,

Keegan Farrell
