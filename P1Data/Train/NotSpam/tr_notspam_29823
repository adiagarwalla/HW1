Attached to this email pls find my revised version of Dirk's letter to CSUF 
incorporating my discussions with Dirk.  As you will see, there are a fair 
number of items that need to be confirmed before sending this to PG&E.  I 
will work on Rob's letter tomorrow as a followup to Dirk's.

Pls call or email with questions, comments, etc.
