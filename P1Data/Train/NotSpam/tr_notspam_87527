We will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the Commission 
takes tomorrow.  The Commission meeting starts at 10 AM PST, but it's unclear 
when they will take up our issue.  Since the press will likely have the place 
surrounded, they may decide to do that item first.  We'll send out a notice 
with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information.

Best,
Jeff
