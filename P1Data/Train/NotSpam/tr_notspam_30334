Colleagues:

GA Support Services and Risk Analytics Groups shall communicate, shortly, a 
system that shall allow you to have a monthly update on EES positions in your 
service territories.  The system shall also provide the position to ad-hoc 
requests as needed.
  
The update shall be on monthly basis, and could be customized as per your 
needs/requests.    The primary sources can provide the following:
The position (long, short, and net) in electric utility "x"
The position (long, short, and net) per customer in the electric utility "x".
The position (long, short, and net) per rate schedule/customer class in 
electric utility "x".
Aggregates of the above per State, NERC Region, and Customer.

GA Support, and Risk Analytics aim at providing the data on a 
request-by-request basis in a user initiated system.  The Team is working on 
building a system to answer your data request within 180 working minutes of 
receiving it.  You shall receive an email of the persons to contact with 
their coordinates (e.g., telephone numbers, location...etc.) shortly.   

In designing this system, the Team is constrained by the EES stringent 
request to guarantee that no third party can have access to data.  Part of 
this concern  is mitigated by the request-by-request approach followed as it 
will communicate the lowest level of disaggregated data.  Your utmost care in 
dealing with these data, in my opinion, should satisfy any remaining concerns 
for EES.     

This the  beginning of a longer series of products and services in the 
pipeline.  The Team is keen to know your opinion, and advice.  Any advice on 
the likely frequency of needing this data, the level of details/aggregation 
will be greatly useful and appreciated.   


Best regards
