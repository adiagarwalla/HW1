ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 Pursuant to a letter faxed to TVA today, January 27th, we notified TVA that 
EPMI was terminating the MOPA effective February 11, 2000 (earliest date 
permitted under the MOPA).  At the same time, we filed an amended petition 
with the court in Tennessee where EPMI's current claim against TVA (interface 
issue) is pending seeking a declaratory judgment that EPMI had the right to 
terminate the MOPA.  In order to include this additional claim in the already 
filed petition, we will need the approval of the court.

   Copies of the letter will be distributed later .
