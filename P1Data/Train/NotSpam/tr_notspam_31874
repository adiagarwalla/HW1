Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000


Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes 
below 4,723 per day. 
          Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.

21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below

21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below


Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?
