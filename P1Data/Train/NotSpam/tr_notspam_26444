Comments are due by 6/11 on the FERC order proposing to reimpose price caps 
on short term capacity releases into the CA markets.  This is in response to 
the complaints filed by SDG&E and LADWP to deal with the high gas prices in 
CA and both parties requested this relief.  The attached first draft is the 
ENA/EES response to the FERC request for comments.  Please review and return 
comments, etc. to me and Becky so we can coordinate the changes.  And please 
forward to anyone I may have left out who should have been included above.
