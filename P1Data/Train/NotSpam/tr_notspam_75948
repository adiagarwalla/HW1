Jim:

Attached is a fairly distilled summary of the projects Enron's offered to the 
utilities, DWR and the ISO over the past 9-12 months, or so.  With respect to 
the power contracts offered to the IOUs, only the offers accepted by PG&E and 
Edison are included---the desk doesn't keep records of offers rejected, only 
offers accepted.  However, I'm fairly confident that I can dig deeper and get 
more info on the other power deals offered to Edison, PG&E and SDG&E if folks 
would like that information.  Just let me know. Prices are included for the 
offers that had prices attached when submitted. 

Best,
Jeff
