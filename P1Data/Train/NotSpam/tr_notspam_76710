 EnSerCo plans to file an arbitration demand against Industrial Holdings, 
Inc. to obtain re-payment of a $15 million promissory note.  

 EnSerCo also plans to make demand against the guarantors of the IHI debt:The 
Rex Group, Rex Machinery Sales, Inc., Rex Machinery Movers, Inc., U.S. 
Crating, Inc., First Texas Credit Corporation, Landreth Engineering Company, 
Pipeline Valve Specialty, Inc., Bolt Manufacturing Co.Inc., LSS-Lone Star 
Houston, Inc., American Rivet Company, Inc., Manifold Valve Services, Inc., 
Philform, Inc., GHX Incorporated, Regal Machine Tool, Inc., Whir Acquisition, 
Inc., Moores Pump and Supply, Inc., GHX Incorporated of Louisiana and Beird 
Industries, Inc.
 
 If you are aware of any reason why an arbitration demand should not be filed 
against any of these entities, please call me or e-mail me by the end of 
business on Monday March 5, 2001.  If I don't hear from you by then, I will 
assume that you have no objection to moving forward against these companies.

 Thanks in advance.
