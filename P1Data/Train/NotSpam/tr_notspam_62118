Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3 
power trading desks.
I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it 
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this 
recommendation.

Vince

Vince,

We have three options to increase our availability across Enron for the Power 
World load flow software.

Option 1, Upgrade to a site license for the load flow software only. Price 
$9,990.00 
This would give all of Enron the ability to perform load flows, but not 
determine marginal cost or available transfer capacity (ATC) because only the 
Optimal Power Flow (OPF) version can perform that task.

Option 2, Site license for the load flow and purchase 1 OPF package for 
Walter Coffer's group.  Price $11,240.
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows and one other 
group the ability to determine marginal cost and ATC.

Option 3, Site license for load flows, OPF and ATC.  Price $14,990.00
This would give all of Enron  the ability to perform load flows, marginal 
cost, and ATC.

Regards,
Lance
