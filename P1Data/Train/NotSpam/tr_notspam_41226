Please review the attached draft Enron comments in response to the San Diego 
request for natural gas price caps.  The comments reflect Becky Cantrell's 
comments (which are reflected in red line).  Please respond to me as soon as 
possible with your comments, and please pass it on to anyone else who needs 
to see it.

Thanks

Sarah
