Dave,  

At our meeting regarding 2001 allocations from the ENW Infrastructure you 
requested a list of our capital projects.  The following email has a summary 
of the projects that make up our proposed 2001 capital.    Please call me at 
x34771 if you have any questions or would like to discuss this in more detail.

Jenny
