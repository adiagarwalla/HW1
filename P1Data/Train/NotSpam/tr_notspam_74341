Subject: RM01-9 Order Proposing Reporting Requirement on Natural Gas Sales To 
California Market and Requesting Comments
Importance: High


I have just received an order proposing new reporting requirements on natural 
gas sales to California markets. Issued today, FERC is proposing a collection 
of information (Appendix consisting of a series of questions to be answered 
by sellers to the California markets, interstate pipelines and LDCs) that 
will assist in understand the disparity that has occurred and continues to 
exist.The information to be reported would include data relating to the 
volumes and prices of sales to California including transporation rates, 
daily operational capacity of pipelines to and in the California markets, and 
the actual volumes flowing to and in California and gas sales and 
trasnportation requirements of LDCs. 

FERC intends to analyze the information and determine what percentage of the 
volumes sold into California is domestically produced gas sold by marketers 
affiliated with pipelnies and LDCs in sales for resales. (These are only 
sales FERC can regulate). This will also give FERC the average gas costs 
being incurred by purchasers moving to California. 

FERC states certain entities, while not regulated by FERC, will need to 
provide the information requested under the authority vested in NGA section 
14 to collect information regardless of whether they are "natural gas 
pipelines."

FERC is proposing that this report be submitted quarterly and submitted 
within thirty days at quarter end. There will be an electronic format 
developed for submission. Responses will be required to be verified under 
oath. Parties may request confidential treatment of their responses. 

This is being requested under emergency processing of the Office of 
Management and Budget auspices. Comments are to be submitted within thirty 
days of this order. 

I will send the order electronically on Monday. It is not on FERC's systems 
yet.
