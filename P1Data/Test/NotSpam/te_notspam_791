I updated the worksheet with a little more info and I added Trco and Tetco 
Marktet area information.  I did this quickly so let me know if something 
doesn't look right.  On Monday, we will show you a bid for the Tetco and Trco 
volumes.

Also, the Tetco and Trco volumes are monthly and the CGAS volumes are daily.
