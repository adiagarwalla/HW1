I have been requested to submit potential reviewers for the mid-year 
process.  Since I have worked with you on various projects, I plan to submit 
your name as a potential reviewer. 
My supervisor, Tim O' Rourke will be contacting you soon.
I appreciate your consideration and input on my review.  If you have any
