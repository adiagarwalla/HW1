Hi Rob,

We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then 
selling the equity.  I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption 
agreement.  Is this ok?  Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?

This is the same transaction I called you about this am.  Any thoughts on the 
notice question?




Thanks,

Kay
