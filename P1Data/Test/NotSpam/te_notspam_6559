Vacation???  I've heard that tomorrow at the staff meeting Mark H. will be 
rolling out the new policy of eliminating all vacation for ENA legal folks.

Lets continue without Kay.  I think this call will be focusing on the 
documents sent out already.

Kay will be on vacation Thursday and Friday.  Can the call go on without 
her?  Same time, 1:30 p.m. CDT?  Let me know please.

lets make the change- GE cannot make it wednesday- plus the extra day gives 
both GE and us time to review the exhibits and the new T&C draft.  given that 
Sheila is in her "hostage situation", the other key person is Kay.   Thanks.

Changing to Thursday works better for Scott Dieball, John Rigby and Peter 
Thompson.
