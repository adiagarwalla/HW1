Karen--regarding press at the WGA event.  There is an opening media conference on Sunday afternoon the 12th and a closing conference on Tuesday afternoon the 14th.  There are only about 20 press types registered to date.  That may change, however, if they get the high profile folks that they are hoping for.  Apparently they are still waiting confirmation on Galye Norton, who they are hoping will be the keynote on  Sunday afternoon. 


The governor attendance list is as follows:	Kitzhaber (OR), Kempthorne (Idaho), Hull(AZ), Leavitt(UT), Hoeven (ND), Johnson (NM), Paul's friend Kenny Guinn from Nevada, Geringer(WY), Janklow(SD),Johnannes(NE), Martz(MT).    Aparently Colorada Governor Owens just cancelled this morning, and my understanding is that it has something to do with President Bush being in Denver on the 14th.   California/Washington/Texas/Alaska/Kansas will be represented by someone in each govs office, but not the govs themselves.
