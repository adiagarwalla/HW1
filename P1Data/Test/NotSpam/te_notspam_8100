Tara Rozen and I have reviewed the cost of living tables provided by our 
outside vendor and determined the appropriate amount of daily per diem while 
in London accompanied by family is $55.00/day.  You should expense this 
through your expense reports for every day you are present in London and not 
on full expenses paid by the Company.

Jane
