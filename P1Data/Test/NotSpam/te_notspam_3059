The attachment below is the personal response from Charles Jeffress to NAM's 
request for clarification as to the compliance date for enforcement to 
commence for the OSHA final rule on Ergonomics. 

This credits the proposed Enron Grandfathering plan to have the remainder of 
the time to Oct. 15, 2001 in which to achieve full activation of the written 
plans within each of the Enron companies.

While there are substantial numbers of law suits filed over this final rule, 
the outlook for any satisfactory court action is unlikely, as is action from 
Congress. Any repeal actions from a new OSHA administration would likely take 
longer than Oct. 15, 2001 to become effective.
