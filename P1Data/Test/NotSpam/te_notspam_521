To all:

Greg's directive is that you need to let me know if any reportable trades 
have occured.  This is a reminder that if any have occured for the week 
ending 1/21/01 to please let me know by 10 a.m. PST Tues.

And just to clarify Greg's note:  I only need to be informed of bids above 
$150/MWh  that were accepted.  I.e., we are not requred to report price-taker 
bids or bids below $150/MWh, even if the market clears above that amount.

Subject: Reporting accepted bids above $150



While we are currently not experiencing many transactions with the Px or ISO 
it is imperative that any accepted bids above $150 be reported conssitent 
with FERC reporting requirements beginning January 1, 2001. Please notify 
Alan Comnes via e-mail immediately if any such bids are accepted such that 
they can be entered into our weekly report to FERC.

Greg
