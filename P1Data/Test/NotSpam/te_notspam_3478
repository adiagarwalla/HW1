Louise:

Attached please find the GTCs for power (with and without credit).  Please note that we are actually using the EEI Master Agreement as the on-line contract, as opposed to the traditional GTCs.  We were actually in the process of making this transition on EOL this fall, and Kevin Presto and Tim Belden have endorsed Netco's use of the EEI on-line.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Leslie
