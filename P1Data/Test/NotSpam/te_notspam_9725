FYI. Ken Lay asked to have the pitch that he's been making California be 
quickly put into a few power point slides for use in meetings he's having 
this week at the gathering of the Business Council (back East) with a group 
of California CEOs (e.g., Sun, Chevron, Amgen, Bechtel and others).  This is 
the version that we gave to Lay's office; he may have modified it.  Will 
check with Rosalee to get the final and distribute that version if changes 
were made.

Best,
Jeff
