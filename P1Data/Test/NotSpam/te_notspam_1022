Hope this finds you well this Holiday Season - and here are some  things to remember and keep us sane for 2002!    Darnell
1.  Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age,  weight and height. 
2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you  down. If you really need a grouch, there are probably family members that fill  that need. 
3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts,  gardening, whatever. Just never let the brain idle. 
4. Enjoy the simple  things. When the children are young, if that is all that you can afford. When  they are in college, if that is all that you can afford.  When they are  grown, and you are on retirement, if that is all that you can afford! And if you  can afford grander things...still enjoy the simple things. 
5. Laugh  often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you  can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter. 
6. The tears  happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire  life, is ourselves. 
7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it  is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your  refuge. 
8. Cherish your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is  unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get  help.  
9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the  mall, the next county, a foreign country, but not guilt. 
10. Tell the  people you love, that you love them, at every opportunity. 
Remember,  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that  take our breath away.  May God richly bless you in the coming year.
