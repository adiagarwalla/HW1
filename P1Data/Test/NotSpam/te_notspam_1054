It's official!  We are moving next week on Thursday, March, 14!  Actually, we have to be packed up by close of business on Wednesday, March 13.  Ruthann will be calling each of you to discuss your move needs, such as your type of computer equipment, whether or not you are moving your chair, etc...Boxes will be coming soon.

Please let Audrey or me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kim.
