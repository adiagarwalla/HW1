Per our phone conversation Saturday, November 17, 2001, this is to advise
that one of the North Team's customer. Reliant Energy Retail, Inc. (Nancy Callans
the Rep) was very, very,dissatisfied as well as questioning the integrity of TMS' 
Allocations for Gas Day 11/16/01.

Since John had discussed the details with me on Friday, November 16, 2001
(7:00 PM)  I will not reiterate them at this time unless we deem it necessary
to review the data at a later date.

Best regards,
Jean L. Blair
North Team
