To the extent that any of you all are holding original documents for either 
the 1999s or 2000s, please forward them to either Stuart Zisman or me 
(2962D).  We are trying to pull together the files which will be delivered to 
Allegheny, and need to track down the originals.  On the 1999s, we are trying 
to tidy up the files in anticipation of the sale.

Thanks again for all the help.

Regards,

Don
