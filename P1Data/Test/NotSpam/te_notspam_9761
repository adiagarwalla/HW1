	I want to thank all of you for your efforts yesterday to help our customers get their
	business taken care of on the Enron pipes.  It looks like we will be in the same
	mode of operation at least through this morning.  

	Please make every effort to contact your customers and let them know they
	can get into Hottap through URL:
		
			www.hottap.corp.com
	 	
	If they are having problems accessing Hottap, give them the pertinent information they
	need to do their "next cycle" business (ie. schedule quantity info).  Let's be proactive and 
	help the customers through this frustrating time.

	I also appreicate everyone staying around until 6:00 last night.  It is good to work with 
	a group that is willing to help out where possible.

	Also, Toby thanks for your "hours" of work on sending out the emails to our customers
	to let them know what our plans were. 

	Thanks. Lynn
