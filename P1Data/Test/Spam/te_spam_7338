times.  5845756 creativity of flavors, 5845756 excellent execution, and 5845756 service was great.  Mesa is located just off 5845756 casino floor of Caesar's and provides a good, but not great ambiance. 5845756 flip side however is 5845756 feel is business casual versus formal, which is great for a Vegas trip where you don't want something too high brow.  Expect a full house, with plenty of . 5845756 food is delicious.  We had 5845756 queso fundido, 5845756 chile relleno, a couple of sides, and a dessert I cannot recall 5845756 last time we went.  Everything was cleaned off 5845756 plate. We felt 5845756 price was also very reasonable, relative to Vegas pricing.  Overall - for a great Mexican restaurant that will impress - we highly recommend. PS - don't expect to see Bobby.  I hear he doesn't make it here too often.  We had an amazing time at Mesa Grill!! From 5845756 service, to 5845756 ambiance, to 5845756 food,
