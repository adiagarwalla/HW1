Forum proposes 800 common Chinese characters

Jul 18, 2013

Renowned scholars and former high-profile politicians from Korea, China, and=
 Japan announced a list of 800 Chinese characters for common use.

=FF=FF=FF A list was compiled of 800 Chinese characters in common use, propo=
sed by scholars and politicians from Korea, China, and Japan.

A list was compiled of 800 Chinese characters in common use, proposed by sch=
olars and politicians from Korea, China, and Japan.
The selection of 800 characters, announced on July 8, was led by former Kore=
an Culture Minister Lee Eo-ryeong, the Renmin University of China, and Japan=
=FF=FF=FFs Kyoto University. To
 finalize the list, they narrowed down 800 characters by comparing 2,500 ch
aracters commonly used by Chinese with 1,006 characters used in Japanese=
cation and 900 basic characters Koreans learn at school.

Korea, China, Taiwan, and Japan have been regarded as the domain of Chinese =
character culture, since they have historically used Chinese characters. Com=
munication difficulties
 remain, however, as each of them uses different variations such as simplif
ied or traditional Chinese characters, demanding the need to unify commonly =
used Chinese characters.

For this reason, a group of experts and former high-ranking officials from K=
orea, China and Japan felt the need for better communication and gathered to=
 discuss the idea of li
sting the Chinese characters for common use for the three countries.

 Chinese characters at a symposium jointly held by Korea=FF=FF=FFs Joongang =

Resort & Spa, Hokkaido. The forum participants also had a heated discussion =
on the theme of future-forward cooperation among Korea, China, and Japan. Tr=
ipartite cooperative of
fices of each of the three governments will review the proposed adoption of
 the Chinese characters.

The forum was attended by an eight-member Korean delegation led by former Ko=
rean Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo. A ten-strong Japanese delegation led by fo=
