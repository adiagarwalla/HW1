 well be a million dollars for some people," Graff said.Graff's store alone 
has seen about a dozen layaway accounts paid off in the last 
10 days, with the donors paying $50 to $250 on each account."To 
be honest, in retail, it's easy to get cynical about the holidays, 
because you're kind of grinding it out when everybody else is having 
family time," Graff said. "It's really encouraging to see this side of 
Christmas again."Lori Stearnes of Omaha also benefited from the generosity of a 
stranger who paid all but $58 of her $250 layaway bill for 
toys for her four youngest grandchildren.Stearnes said she and her husband live 
paycheck to paycheck, but she plans to use the money she was 
saving for the toys to help pay for someone else's layaway.In Missoula, 
Mont., a man spent more than $1,200 to pay down the balances 
of six customers whose layaway orders were about to be returned to 
a Kmart store's inventory because of late payments.Store employees reached one benefici
 y from being the next victim of Europe's debt crisis.The Senate is 
expected to vote on the measures in the next few days to 
complete the legislative approval.As lawmakers voted, a one-day nationwide transportation strike caused 
chaos for commuters.Many rushed to work or school to anticipate the start 
of the strike, while some railway travelers were left.Unions are incensed over 
pension reforms making Italians work more years and until an older age 
before being eligible for generous pension checks. Monti's government softened the reforms 
slightly.The wide majority of votes in favor of the package was expected, 
but that doesn't mean the main political parties are happy with all 
of it.Lawmakers on both left and right of center have criticized as 
too harsh the reforms to Italy's pension system. Many of former premier 
Silvio Berlusconi's loyalists, who make up Parliament's largest party, denounced Monti's decision 
to revive a home property tax that Berlusconi had eli
in Hong Kong. "It's kind of cynical."Formalizing Gao's detention as a prison 
term, Rosenzweig said, gives Chinese leaders a ready response to queries from 
foreign governments and officials. Gao's case has repeatedly been raised by the 
U.S. and European governments, drawing cryptic responses if any from Chinese officials. 
U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke mentioned him in a public statement last weekend.Gao's 
wife fled China with their two children, escorted by human traffickers overland 
to Southeast Asia, around the time he first disappeared. They now live 
in the United States.Now living in California, Geng said she learned about 
the Xinhua report when a friend called her as she was taking 
her daughter to school. "We've asked them (the Chinese authorities) so many 
times, and they would never tell us anything," Geng said.She said the 
family has yet to receive any notice from the police or courts 
about Gao's case and they still have no idea where he is.Adding
