oth campaigns, and the groups that support them, were on air with 
scorching attack ads in the Sunshine State.Santorum decried the tone of the 
campaign Tuesday night, urging the party to focus on the "real issue, 
which is defeating Barack Obama.""Republicans can do better," Santorum said. "Really, this 
campaign went downhill. ... the American public does not want to see 
two or three candidates get into a mud-wrestling match where everybody walks 
away dirty."Santorum said that will not help the GOP in November.Romney, though, 
said a "competitive primary" will prepare, not divide, the Republican Party. He 
went on to slam the Obama administration for its record on job 
creation, foreign policy and other issues. "Mr. President -- you were elected 
to lead, you chose to follow, and now it's time for you 
to get out of the way," Romney said.Gingrich, too, focused part of 
his remarks on Obama and his own plans for reversing steps the 
Obama administration has taken. Ging
e attacking each other on personal stuff, that's gonna get this nomination 
won," the former Pennsylvania senator told Fox News, speaking from Sioux Falls, 
S.D., where he held a quick event after being in Laverne, Minn., 
the night before.Minnesota holds its primary next week and will award 40 
delegates. Missouri has a primary next week but its 52 delegates aren't 
selected until caucuses in a month. Nevada has its caucuses this weekend 
and 28 delegates to allocate. Colorado's caucuses, which award 36 delegates, are 
next week.By all accounts, even if Romney were to seal the deal 
optically with a victory in Florida, he won't win 1,144 delegates -- 
50 percent plus one -- to secure the nomination until at least 
April.Santorum noted that Tuesday's vote in Florida is only the fourth of 
more than 50 to be had, if one's counting the four U.S. 
territories, which have nine delegates each. He said all of them will 
have delegates to designate to the national convention in 
U.S. stocks are opening higher after solid manufacturing data from around the 
world.Just after the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average is up 
78 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,713. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 
500 index is up 9 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,322. The 
Nasdaq composite is up 19 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,833.Investors hope 
positive manufacturing data for China and Europe mean similar growth is happening 
in the U.S.The Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index is due to 
be released at 10 a.m. Eastern. Economists forecast that U.S. factory output 
grew faster in January after businesses spent more on machinery, airplanes and 
other equipment.Investors will also focus on monthly hiring figures from private payroll 
agency ADP.

return home and reunite with his family," the letter said. Walid said 
members of his group will travel to Iran if that would help 
obtain freedom for Hekmati."We're hopeful that Mr. Hekmati will be granted some 
clemency," Walid said. "If the Iranians are willing to talk regarding releasing 
Mr. Hekmati, then we're willing to fly to Tehran if need be."Iranian 
authorities said that Hekmati received special training and served at U.S. military 
bases in Iraq and Afghanistan before traveling to Iran on an intelligence 
mission. A court convicted him of belonging to the CIA and trying 
to incriminate Iran for involvement in terrorism.The U.S. denied the accusations. The 
State Department called them a "complete fabrication," and White House spokesman Tommy 
Vietor added that "allegations that Mr. Hekmati either worked for or was 
sent to Iran by the CIA are false."The Marine Corps said Hekmati 

 in South Florida, but it does lend some credence to his campaign 
strategy that with a lot of delegate-rich southern states to vote next 
month, Gingrich has time to wait for the next gust of wind 
to fill his sails.Florida certainly narrowed Gingrichs chances, but it certainly didnt 
end them. Weve got at least five more crazy weeks to go.Chris 
Stirewalt is digital politics editor for Fox News, and his POWER PLAY 
column appears Monday-Friday on FoxNews.com.-- Power Play, the political note, will be

asty into a third generation.North Korea proudly trumpets its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and has a history of aggression against its southern neighbor, 
and there has been uncertainty about whether Pyongyang will now lean toward 
provocation or reconciliation -- and how tightly Pyongyang will cling to its 
nuclear program.Pyongyang conducted nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 and has developed 
missiles with the potential to attack its neighbors and possibly reach the 
United States.South Korean Prime Minister Kim Hwang-sik said Tuesday that Seoul is 
ready for cooperation "if North Korea shows sincerity."Shortly before Kim Jong Il's 
death, Washington and Pyongyang appeared close to a deal on food aid. 
The North, in turn, was expected to suspend uranium enrichment, which could 
give Pyongyang another possible route to making nuclear bombs and is a 
crucial hurdle to restarting six-nation aid-for-nuclear disarmament talks that have been stalled 
since early 2009.North
