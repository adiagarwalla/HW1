		 friendly but I did have a very slow experience this time..However this is quickly forgotten once 2087940 food comes out..If you like your spicy and need a wake me up with flavors come check out MESA you won't be disappointed.. My visit was without reservation but I think we got lucky for it quickly filled up and there was  line when leaving...I'm very surprised I'm only giving this 3 stars.  As I love Bobby Flay's taste in sauces and food in general.  I think we share a similar palette.  2087940 man knows how to use a blender to create some bold and wonderful flavors.  Like myself - he likes a little heat but not so much that it just overpowers everything. But something is missing from Mesa Grill.  I think I know what it is.  VALUE.  Look - I know it's not Little Caesar's pizza.  We're not getting 2 large pizzas for $9 or whatever.  But when you order a $12 appetizer and you get like 2 duck tacos to share amongst your table of white collar professionals who are aghast at 2087940 appetizer pricing you know something is wrong.  Love 2087940 flavor of said duck tacos.  Love 2087940 flavor of his tamales.  2087940 masa is just so flavorful!  Unlike any tamale I've had. But still....even with a nice steak.  2087940 meal just is too expensive for what you get.  This is coming from someone  who has spent $400 for a meal and been happy to do so. Something is missing but can't express it as well as I'd like.  I may take one for 2087940 Yelp team and go there again so I can update this review.  Now it's bugging me.... We showed up an hour before our dinner reservation because we were huuungrrry, and they accommodated us. 2087940 interior of 2087940 restaurant is quite nice, but 2087940 atmosphere is a bit too casual for 2087940 prices it carries. We ordered 2087940 Tiger Shrimp with garlic corn tamale and Pan Seared Squid for appetizers. Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. 2087940 sauces are a tad too sweet. 2087940 tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm 2087940 maiz. 2087940 squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy. I had 2087940 veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved 2087940 sauce - a little sweet like 2087940 other dishes, but 2087940 subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. 2087940 wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet. Others in my party had 2087940 rib eye and 2087940 filet, both of which I sampled and found 2087940 sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste 2087940 meat. But my friends loved their dishes. Double baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like 2087940 sweet taste more than spicy. Our waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty. Between 2087940 4 of us, 2087940 bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. It was a tasty meal and we enjoyed
