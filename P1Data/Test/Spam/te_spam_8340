Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage 
North Korea in nuclear

of this years biggest breakout stars were long-overlooked veterans.Melissa McCarthys performances in 
"Bridesmaids" and "Mike and Molly" earned her a long overdue moment in 
the spotlight, Ryan Gosling made his way into mainstream movies and the 
hearts of women everywhere, and Octavia Spencer left us both laughing and 
crying through her performance in "The Help."SODAHEAD SLIDESHOW: See the biggest breakout 
stars of 2011.Jessica Chastain, who appeared in six movies, and Michael Fassbender, 
who appeared in four, were two actors who couldnt be missed this 
year. And let's not forget their respective Golden Globe nominations for "The 
Help" and "Shame."On "Glee" Naya Rivera proved that she is much more 
than a comedic foil, and in "Martha Marcy May Marlene," Elizabeth Olsen 
demonstrated that she has absolutely no need to capitalize on her older 
sisters' fame.In the music industry, Scott

dynasty enters its third generation, North Korea is struggling to feed its 
own people and has recoiled from reform of its struggling command economy. 
Despite rising trade and cooperation with chief foreign backer China, the nation's 
very future is in doubt."The most likely scenario for regime collapse has 
been the sudden death of Kim (Jong Il). We are now in 
that scenario," said Victor Cha, a former U.S. National Security Council director 
for Asian affairs.The White House's initial, brief reaction to the North Korean 
state media report of Kim Jong Il's death Saturday from a heart 
ailment emphasized regional security, saying that the U.S. was in close touch 
with its allies, South Korean and Japan."We remain committed to stability on 
the Korean peninsula, and to the freedom and security of our allies," 
a statement said.The Obama administration has taken a cautious path in dea

Cruise, whose audience became disenchanted with odd antics in the star's personal 
life five or six years ago."I would think any of that is 
way in the past," said Don Harris, head of distribution at Paramount, 
which took the unusual step of going early in huge-screen cinemas to 
build buzz for the general release."The plan was always to put the 
movie out into the best presentation theaters in North America," Harris said. 
"We hoped that people would recognize how good the movie was and 
how special it was being treated."Paramount's comic drama "Young Adult," starring Charlize 
Theron, had a weak expansion into wider release, finishing at No. 7 
with $3.7 million. The film had opened with big numbers a week 
earlier in a handful of theaters.At the beginning of 2011, Hollywood's summer

arrangement, one that bolsters the brand value of both parties.That all goes

television star and the polarizing rapper after the pair were all over 
each other at an after-party following a Jay-Z concert on Tuesday night.

the most toxic celebrity couple of all time.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.We are 
starting out with two individuals with the deck stacked against them, and 
when you put the two of them together, they will be a

more people or be more successful. He said he never sees a 
single hand raised in the audience in response."His policies have hurt, not 
helped," he said. Romney said part of the problem may be Obama's 
leadership style. Obama has not met with Republicans in five months, but 
has instead gone on "constant attack either against Republicans or against people 
in the business world or whatever group he somehow feels is opposed 
to his agenda.""Leaders actually spend time meeting with people on the other 
side of the aisle, understand their needs, understand their concerns, get their 
input and look for some way to find common ground," he said. 
"We need a leader who understands not just the words of unity
