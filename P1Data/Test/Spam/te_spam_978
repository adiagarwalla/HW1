h the budgets approved in 2007.Economic pressures combined with Republicans gaining control 
of more statehouses around the country have created ripe conditions for shrinking 
state governments, said Robert O'Connell, executive director of the Tennessee State Employees 
Association."You end up with this chopping up of state services and getting 
rid of state employees," he said.Even as the total number of state 
employees has plummeted, the ratio of public employees per 1,000 residents varies 
widely by state, the AP reporting found.Alaska had the most with 34.9, 
while Illinois had the fewest with 4.1 after cutting more than 4,000 
workers from the state payroll since 2007. The AP figures exclude K-12 
teachers and employees in highercation systems.Indiana, Ohio and Michigan were the 
only other states with five or fewer state employees per 1,000 residents.

2007 because of budget pressures.States wit

a legacy of 19th century Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. 
Mormons abandoned the practice of plural marriage in the 1890s as a 
condition of Utah's statehood. The church now excommunicates members found engaging in 
polygamy.An estimated 38,000 self-described Mormon fundamentalists continue the practice, believing it brings 
exaltation in heaven. Most keep their way of life a secret. In 
most cases, polygamous men are legally married to their first wives and 
marry subsequent brides only religious ceremonies.Sister Wives (TLC)

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
 trengthen EPA as an organization and a leader in the nations progress 
toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing

WASHINGTON  The Obama administration is warily watching developments on the Korean 
peninsula after the death of North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il and 
may postpone decisions on re-engaging the reclusive country in nuclear talks and 
providing it with food aid, U.S. officials said Sunday.The administration had been 
expected to decide on both issues this week, possibly as early as 
Monday, but the officials said Kim's death would likely delay the process. 
The officials spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of 
the situation. They said the U.S. was particularly concerned about any changes 
that Kim's death might spark in the military postures of North and 
South Korea but were hopeful that calm would prevail.The White House said 
it was monitoring the situation closely and remained in constant contact with 
allies South Korea and Japan, but it offered no substantive comment on 
the implications of Kim's death. President Barack Obama spoke with South Korean P
