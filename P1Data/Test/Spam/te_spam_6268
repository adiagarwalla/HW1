saying North Korea should first take steps toward nuclear disarmament.North Korea has 
also condemned South Korea's refusal to allow its citizens, except for two 
private delegations, to visit Pyongyang and pay respects to Kim Jong Il 
during a mourning period in December.The poor ties between the rivals also 
extend to sports. South Korea said Wednesday that a North Korean youth 
football team boycotted a game in China against a South Korean squad 
because of the high political tensions.Still, Pyongyang has also suggested it is 
open to suspending its uranium enrichment program if it can get the 
food it wants from the United States.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersMarch 20: A British Typhoon jet lands at a NATO airbase in 
southern Italy.BRUSSELS  European Union nations must increasingly pool their military resources,

focus of an inquiry launched by Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., seeking to 
determine whether public money was improperly spent on abortions.According to a statement 
from Planned Parenthood, the Komen Foundation began informing local Planned Parenthoods in 
the past few weeks that their breast cancer initiatives would no longer 
be eligible for new grants
