Coffee drinking habits in the United States are different from the way they =
are in the rest of the world. Pop U.S.A. culture, including food habits, oft=
en become worldwide hab
its, but I think our coffee drinking habits remain unique. The internationa
l phenomenon of Strabucks may be changing this however. Here are a few Ameri=
can coffee-drinking customs that others may find strange:

It is customary to drink coffee with dessert. In many European countries cof=
fee is had after dessert. You can generally ask for a second or third
cup for no additional fee. In some lower-priced restaurants, people often dr=
ink coffee with their meal--in fact the coffee cup (and in some places coffe=
e pot) may be on the ta
ble before the customer sits down. Iced coffee (coffee poured over ice) is=20=

a popular and refreshing drink when the weather is hot. Some restaurants who=
se specialty is not coffee are called cafes. Coffee is a fairly watery drink=
 served with cold milk.
 If a Frenchman or Spaniard wants coffee the way they they are accostomed t
o it, they must ask for expresso. Not all places make it, and fewer make it =
well.

It's because you're asking "cu=FF=FFles". You're asking, among the many poss=
ibilities people know, which one is valid, so you need a definite article: "=
=FF=FFCu=FF=FFles son las cosas poco c
onocidas (que usted s=FF=FF conoce)?"

If it had been a statement, you would not have been talking about something =
people is supposed to know, so "algunas" would be fine: "Algunas cosas poco =
conocidas de la cultura
 japonesa son..."

@Marmoset: There you have it, some people will find the question alright, wh=
ile for some it needs another way to be expressed.

This is way off-topic, but I think the topic was finished anyway. I see that=
 expression cultura poco conocida and think that should be poca conocida. Af=
ter all, you say tengo=20
poca ropa.

I really do know that adverbs are not declined, but adjectives are, so I'm n=
ot looking for an explanation. What I was wondering was whether your Joe Ave=
rage Spanish guy (Pepe=20
Promedio ) would actually say it correctly, and whether he could explain wh
y poco and not poca. Does it sound 'normal' to everybody?

It's because you're asking "cu=FF=FFles". You're asking, among the many poss=
ibilities people know, which one is valid, so you need a definite article: "=
=FF=FFCu=FF=FFles son las cosas poco c
onocidas (que usted s=FF=FF conoce)?"

If it had been a statement, you would not have been talking about something =
people is supposed to know, so "algunas" would be fine: "Algunas cosas poco =
conocidas de la cultura
 japonesa son..."

I don't see anything wrong with the sentence "=FF=FFcu=FF=FFles son algunas =
cosas.....?"

@Marmoset: There you have it, some people will find the question alright, wh=
ile for some it needs another way to be expressed.

This is way off-topic, but I think the topic was finished anyway. I see that=
 expression cultura poco conocida and think that should be poca conocida. Af=
ter all, you say tengo=20
poca ropa.

I really do know that adverbs are not declined, but adjectives are, so I'm n=
ot looking for an explanation. What I was wondering was whether your Joe Ave=
rage Spanish guy (Pepe=20
Promedio ) would actually say it correctly, and whether he could explain wh
y poco and not poca. Does it sound 'normal' to everybody?
