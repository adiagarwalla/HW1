d not nailed down the timing of that announcement. The officials acknowledged 
that Biden's comments sped up the timetable dramatically, and that the vice 
president's remarks were not part of an orchestrated roll-out of the president's 
position -- in other words, the president was not planning to address 
the issue this week.Obama's decision was met with immediate praise by gay 
advocacy groups."President Obama's 'evolution' is now complete. Congratulations, Mr. President, for making 
history today by becoming the first sitting president to explicitly support marriage 
for same-sex couples," said Rea Carey, director of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force.Yet the endorsement entails political risk, particularly among independents who 
were vital to Obama's 2008 victory and even socially conservative black Democrats. 
While the list of states that allow gay marriage is growing, a 
total of 30 states have constitutional amendments or laws barring those partnerships

when a zip lining accident went from bad to much, much worse. 
Just one week ago, Aimee was enjoying a trip kayaking down a 
creek with some of her friends in Carrollton, Ga. But when she 
stopped to ride on a homemade zip line along the water, the 
line snapped and cut a large gash in her left calf.Initially, Aimee 
had gone to the emergency room at the Tanner Medical Center in 
Carrollton on Tuesday after she had received the gash. She thought the 
ordeal was over after the doctors stapled her leg up with 22 
staples and told her to take pain medication, according to her father.But 
Aimee returned to the hospital Wednesday after she continued to complain of 
severe pain in her leg. She was prescribed pain killers and sent 
home yet again.The pain still did not subside, so a friend drove 
a pale and weak Aimee to Tanner Medical again Friday morning. When 
she arrived, an ER doctor diagnosed her with necrotizing fasciitis  a 
flesh-eating bacteria disorder of the deep la
ack in Damascus occurred on Dec. 23, when two car bombers blew 
themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops 
shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the 
cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N. 
military observers now in Syria should grow to m

 TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of 
Albania's commitment to accountability and the rule of law."A Council of Europe 
report by Swiss politician Dick Marty alleged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army ran detention centers on Albania's border during neighboring Kosovo's war for 
independence from Serbia. It says civilian captives, including Serbs, were killed there 
and their organs sold on the black market.Both Kosovo and Albania have 
denied those allegations.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and
