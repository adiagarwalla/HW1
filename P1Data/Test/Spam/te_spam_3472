WELLINGTON, Fla.  A Florida businessman has adopted his 42-year-old girlfriend, it 
emerged Tuesday, in a civil case which one judge said was taking 
the court "into a legal twilight zone."John Goodman, founder of the International 
Polo Club Palm Beach, legally adopted Heather Laruso Hutchins as his daughter 
on Oct. 13 in Miami-Dade County, according to court documents cited by 
The Palm Beach Post.The unprecedented legal move was exposed in connection with 
a civil case in which Goodman, from Wellington in Palm Beach County, 
is being sued for wrongful death over a Feb. 12, 2010 crash 
that killed 23-year-old Scott Patrick Wilson.Attorneys for Wilson's parents, who launched the 
action, allege the adoption is simply an attempt to shield assets."The events 
which serve as the grounds for the relief sought by the Plaintiffs 
border on the surreal and take the Court into a legal twilight 
zone," wrote Circuit Judge Glenn Kelley, in an order granting attorneys for 
Lili an
rea and sought assistance from Western countries to help stanch the smuggling.Tension 
has been building over Iran's nuclear program. The West is imposing new 
sanctions, charging that Iran is building nuclear weapons. Iran denies that and 
threatens to retaliate for the sanctions by closing the Strait of Hormuz, 
a vital oil passage.Click here for more from The Jerusalem Post.The Associated 
Press contributed to this report.
 satisfied with North Korea's stance. North Korea has vowed since Kim's 
death not to deal with South Korea's current conservative government, but it 
has also suggested a willingness to negotiate with the United States."We are 
open to diplomacy with North Korea, but there is a very clear 
set of steps that we think are necessary," Campbell told reporters after 
meetings with South Korean Deputy Foreign Minister Kim Jae-shin and South Korean 
nuclear envoy Lim Sung-nam."We agreed that the path is open to North 
Korea toward the resumption of talks and improved relations" with Washington and 
Seoul, Campbell said, but "the road to improve these relations runs through 
Seoul for North Korea.""We are still waiting to see whether the new 
government in North Korea is prepared to take the necessary steps," Campbell 
said.Many are closely watching to see what direction North Korea will take 
as Kim's young son, Kim Jong Un, works to consolidate power and 
extend his family dyn

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersJanuary 30, 2012: Taliban militants hand over their weapons after joining the 
Afghan government's reconciliation and reintegration program, in Heart.LONDON  A highly-classified U.S. 
report that said the Taliban, backed by Pakistan, is ready to take 
control in Afghanistan was not an analysis of the military campaign's progress, 
a NATO spokesman said Wednesday.The document, leaked to The London Times, "may 
provide some level of representative sampling of Taliban opinions and ideals but 
clearly should not be used as any interpretation of campaign progress," Lieutenant 
Colonel Jimmie Cummings told AFP.The "State of the Taliban" report, compiled by 
U.S. forces operating out of Afghanistan's Bagram Air Field, suggested that the 
10-year Western-led intervention in the country will not stop the Taliban from 
returning to power."Though the Taliban suffered severely in 2011, its strength, motivation, 
funding and tactical proficiency remains intact," the report said. 
 d, especially the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The company's global sales climbed 
22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The Florida Highway Patrol says the body of an 
eleventh person has been found in a pickup truck days after a 
deadly pileup on Interstate 75.The Highway Patrol says the Alachua County Medical 
Examiner's Office determined Tuesday that a third victim was inside a Dodge 
pickup truck that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south 
early Sunday. The driver and another passenger in that vehicle have still 
not been identified.Fog and smoke ced visibility along the stretch of highway 
south of Gainesville, causing authorities to close I-75 for more than three 
hours early Sunday. Authorities reopened the road shortly before the pileups occurred 
on both the northbound and southbound lanes. At least 18 people were 
sent to the hospital.
