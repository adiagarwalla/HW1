MONTREAL  Police say smoke bombs were set off at multiple points 
in Montreal's subway system, briefly cutting off service and creating a nightmarish 
morning commute.Quebec Premier Jean Charest condemned the attack, saying he hopes the 
guilty parties are found.The incident occurred near the peak of Thursday morning 
rush hour. Most service was restored just after 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).Subway 
service has been interrupted in recent weeks as the city deals with 
student protests over tuition increases.Thursday's subway shutdown caused long lineups at bus 
stops and increased traffic under a heavy drizzle.Sign up for free e-mail

e in the state constitution. And it hosts the Democratic National Convention 
in September.Obama said he rushed into announcing his new position after Vice 
President Joe Biden got "a little bit over his skis" in publicly 
endorsing gay marriage days earlier, opening an apparent disconnect in the White 
House over the issue.But his do-over came just in time to make 
a big splash at a pair of fund-raisers: a Hollywood gala at 
actor George Clooney's home Thursday night and a New York event on 
Monday drawing some of Obama's biggest gay and lesbian donors from the 
area. The Clooney dinner alone is expected to raise almost $15 million, 
a record.As told by aides, Obama concluded earlier this year that gay 
couples should have the legal right to marry and planned to say 
so before the convention. Speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss internal 
White House conversations, they said the White House felt compelled to accelerate 
its plans after Biden declared his support
A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not 
mentio
  to everybody? Sure, but all's well that ends well."Obama's campaign was 
not shy about drawing attention to the announcement.By Wednesday evening, he had 
sent out a campaign email saying: "Today, I was asked a direct 
question and gave a direct answer: I believe that same-sex couples should 
be allowed to marry."The email included a link for supporters to donate 
to the campaign.His campaign on Thursday morning released a web video titled: 
"Mitt Romney: Backwards on Equality."The video launched with a clip of Obama's 
ABC News interview, followed by a clip of Romney saying he opposes 
gay marriage and civil unions if they are "identical" to gay marriage 
in all but name.The video went on to list the rights that 
Romney would allegedly "deny," claiming at the end that Obama is "moving 
us forward" while Romney "would take us back."Republicans, meanwhile, have accused the 
president of playing politics with his announcement.Romney, asked about the issue Wednesday, 
said 
alia decided to open shop in their community.Jessenia Mendez-Velazquez, a member of 
a local civic group, called the Health Department to shut down the 
mobile hot dog stand and then engaged in a brief shouting match 
with Scalia.Scalia said she will apply for the specific permits and in 
the meantime promises to open again, this time in Long Beach.Click for
