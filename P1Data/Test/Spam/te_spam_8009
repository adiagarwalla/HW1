ssociated Press first reported on the failed bomb plot, which involved a 
sophisticated new type of explosive device, on Monday. Rogers said the information 
was leaked as far back as two weeks ago, though the story 
was held until this week.Information continues to stream out about the plot, 
with sources now saying the supposed bomber was actually a U.S. intelligence 
informant who infiltrated Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.But Rogers, aside from 
expressing concern that the Monday reporting halted an ongoing operation, questioned the 
veracity of some of the details still being reported about the operation 
-- without offering specifics. He said the leaks could challenge the U.S. 
relationship with its intelligence partners overseas."These leaks are dangerous and could lead 
to someone's death," he said.Rogers said he's conducting a "preliminary review," and 
questioned whether someone "may be trying to put this in a political 
narrative to help their politics."Other
aining that you cant publicly express your support for their most cherished 
cause.Dana Milbank, a Washington Post columnist with impeccable Democratic sources, writes today 
that one in six of Obamas top fundraisers is openly gay. Obama 
is running the most expensive campaign in history, already burning through tens 
of millions of dollars each month. He needs his bundlers fired up 
and ready to go.It is telling of Obamas intense financial needs that 
this week he is willing to risk the support of swing-state moderates 
but not his fundraising corps.A Quote to Remember in NovemberTheyve just handed 
us the names of 900,000 people who are known, or are likely 
to be, anti-conservative voters. Its a huge favor theyve done. Without it 
you were stuck with somehow ID'ing these voters.Rick Wiley, political director of 
the Republican National Committee, talking to Slate on how the recall petitions 
in the union-led effort to unseat Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker helps Republicans
open to the Republicans moderate record and economic pitch.But certainly this week 
was not an ideal time to announce his feelings, given North Carolinas 
vote as well as the raspberry West Virginia Democrats blew in his 
direction. Obama is already in bad shape with moderate Democrats and he 
can hardly benefit from reviving the culture war from the left. A 
strong plurality of Americans already think that Obama is too liberal and 
his endorsement of same-sex marriage will certainly not help him undo that 
damaging perception.So why now?Obama says it was because of Bidens blunder. The 
president, who has in the past mocked Sheriff Joe, certainly has a 
case in arguing that his second-in-command is gaffe prone.But tonight, Obama is 
headed to California for a huge fundraiser with movie heartthrob George Clooney. 
The event will include many Hollywood luminaries and will itself raise millions 
for the presidents re-election bid. In addition, Obama has been raising money

fault of air traffic control, it won't be quite so bad because 
they'll be able to say, 'Well, it's not the airplane'."The Superjet made 
its inaugural commercial flight last year."It is their big hope that they 
will somehow get into the jet aircraft passenger market in a bigger 
way than they have," Ballantyne said."We all know that the Russians have 
had a dreadful record in the past with their aircraft, so this 
was vitally important to their industry."With a relatively low price tag of

bill House Republicans passed because, among other things, it includes a provision 
that blocks a gun control law his administration used Operation Fast and 
Furious to pass.The Obama administrations Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives 
wrote, and began implementing, a new rule that would require gun dealers 
in the four U.S. states that border Mexico to report sales of 
multiple semi-automatic rifles to the ATF.In the 2013 fiscal year budget for 
the Department of Justice and related agencies, House Republicans inserted a rider, 
or condition, that would force the ATF to not implement that rule.In
