Dear Sirs! 

If you recieved this email, then you may have received a spam message with 
"advertising" of our website Pohudeu.com. The word "advertisement" is in 
quotes, because 50 letters sent to one box cannot be called an advertisement. 
We assure you that we never sent these messages and have no relationship to 
this mailing. The fact is that at the end of August, we received a 
requirement from a distributor of harmful dietary supplements to remove an 
article about this harmful dietary supplements from our website Pohudeu.com. 
Because they have not provided any facts to refute our article, we have not 
agreed to remove it. Next they started this spam campaign to compromise our 
reputation, so that we would be closed for spamming. Our project Pohudeu.com 
is completely non commercial. We don't sell any kind of stuff, products or 
services, we don't earn on advertising. From early September our website 
Pohudeu.com was under continual DDoS attacks. Nevertheless, we truly hope 
that spam-mailing and DDoS attacks will stop soon. We cannot tell when this 
campaign against our website Pohudeu.com will be end. We are sorry for this 
inconvenience. 

Kind regards,
Pohudeu.com team.
