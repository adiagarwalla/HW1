plea was entered on Crain's behalf during her arraignment Thursday in Pottawatomie 
County. Her attorney, Cregg Webb, did not return a phone message Friday 
left at his office in Shawnee.Smothermon said he's also discussing the possibility 
of federal charges, but that Oklahoma statutes carry lengthier sentences."We want to 
make sure we can get the maximum amount of time that we 
can," he said.The case first came to light in November when the 
parents of a 9-year-old girl contacted police after their daughter attended a 
pizza party at Crain's McLoud home. The girl told police Crain had

the Oakley sunglasses company who lives on Orcas, was repeatedly victimized. Harris-Moore 
hid out for long periods in the second level of his hangar 
at the airport, and when Parnell and his family would go on 
trips in their plane, Harris-Moore would take their car to their house 
and eat their food. At one point, Harris-Moore entered their home while 
Parnell was there with his wife and three children and grabbed his 
wife's car keys off a counter."We were all fearing for our lives," 
Parnell said Thursday. "The kids wouldn't sleep in their own bedrooms. We
