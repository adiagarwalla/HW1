trengthen EPA as an organization and a leader in the nations progress 
toward a sustainable future.Whatever EPA does with its suggestions, the study emphasizes, 
will be discretionary. But the study urges EPA to create a new 
culture among all EPA employees, and hire an array of new experts 
in order to bring the sustainability focus to every corner of the 
agency and its operations. Changes will move faster as EPAs intentions and 
goals in sustainability become clear to employees, the study says.The National Academies 
and the EPA held a meeting last week in Washington to begin 
public discussion of the study.Even as it begins to go public, EPA, 
which has come under renewed fire for its recent rulings on new 
auto emissions standards and limits on coal-fueled power plant emissions, is being 
determinedly low-key about the study.Initially questioned about the document by Fox News 
weeks ago, an EPA spokesman eventually declared that we are currently reviewing 
the recomme
ame as a surprise to me," Hefner told E! "I kind of 
had mixed emotions about it initially, and then it turned into something 
bigger than life. "I wasn't quite sure where she was at in 
her life, obviously. It depends on whether it's Tuesday or Thursday."The Lohan 
pictorial was leaked online last week after a hacker found the pictures 
on a shared computer server. The leak spooked the magazine, which decided 
to move up their publication date and release the pictures on their 
own site to try to maximize sales in the wake of the 
leak."Because of the interest &amp; the Internet leak, we're releasing the Lindsay 
Lohan issue early," Hef himself tweeted. Playboy reportedly printed thousands of extra 
copies of the magazine in anticipation of a rush on it.The entire 
roll-out for the Lohan Playboy spread has been mired in disaster. After 
a travel snafu this week, Lohan was unable to make it back 
from a Hawaiian vacation in order to do her single interview for

Calif.  Stanley Hall has been deemed safe by officials after air

said Janet Gilmore, a school spokeswoman. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S.

university officials in cleaning up the spill, which occurred the previous night.The 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency wants to change how it analyzes problems and

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ReutersMembers of the House of Representatives are being told that no holiday 
greetings, including Merry Christmas, can be sent out in official mail.According to 
the Washington Examiner, members who submit official mailings for review by the 
congressional franking commission that reviews all congressional mail to determine if it 
can be "franked," or paid for with tax dollars, are being told 
that no holiday greetings, including "Merry Christmas," can be sent."I called the 
commission to ask for clarification and was told no 'Merry Christmas.' Also 
told cannot say 'Happy New Year' but can say 'have a happy 
new year'  referencing the time period of a new year, but 
not the holiday," a Hill staffer who requested anonymity told the paper.Another 
Hill staffer said that "we were given that advice after submitting" a 
draft mailing.Members of Congress send millions of dollars worth of mail to 
constituents every year, but there are official rules that govern what can 
and 
 women and children and many of whom lived along river banks. Flood 
waters came gushing after 12 hours of pounding rain, catching most of 
them in their sleep.Residents told local officials that plans for a mass 
burial was "un-Christian," said Cagayan de Oro city administrator Griscelda Joson.Mayor Vicente 
Emano called a meeting later Monday to discuss the problem. Funeral parlors 
have asked authorities to do something about the unclaimed bodies because of 
the stench and complaints from neighbors, she said.More bodies continue to be 
found. While city officials were meeting Sunday, more than 40 bodies were 
seen floating off an island but the coast guard could not recover 
them, Joson said.In a grim sign of desperation, a funeral parlor dumped 
about 30 badly decomposed bodies in a city garbage dump over the 
weekend, sparking protests from distraught villagers who were looking for the missing 
loved ones.Ramos, the head of the agency that is spearheading the recovery a
 Libya later next year, the U.S. could consider granting asylum."The perception 
is just because these folks received the scholarship from the Qaddafi family 
they are somehow aligned ... with the Qaddafi family," said Eugenia Zacks-Carney, 
an immigration attorney who has been working with the Libyans at Michigan 
State. "Nothing could be further from the truth."Michigan State launched the program 
in 2010 under a contract with Libya's National Economic Development Board to 
provide training in English, political science and international relations for future foreign 
service officials. Elbergwa, who describes her family as middle-class, was working toward 
a master's degree in international relations in Benghazi when she entered the 
program.She said that for those interested in public service in Libya, there 
was no alternative to dealing with the Qaddafi regime."Everything in the country 
was controlled by their family. ... We liked to call Libya `Qaddafi's 
farm,"' sai
