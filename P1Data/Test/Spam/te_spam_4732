has been building over Iran's nuclear program. The West is imposing new

 ReutersFILE 2009: Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki gestures during talks with his 
Egyptian counterpart Ahmed Nazif in Cairo.BAGHDAD  Iraq's parliament reconvened Tuesday after 
Sunni-backed lawmakers ended their boycott to protest alleged persecution of Sunni officials, 
a development that could restore some stability in the war-ravaged country.Last month 
the Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc banned lawmakers and government ministers from parliament and 
Cabinet sessions after the Shiite-led government issued an arrest warrant against the 
Sunni Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi on terrorism charges.The boycott brought government work 
to a standstill and plunged the country into a political crisis just 
days after the U.S. completed its military withdrawal in mid-December. The sectarian 
political fight has been accompanied by a surge in violence, killing more 
than 200 people this month and raising fears of a civil war.Iraqiya 
leaders lifted the parliament ban on Sunday, and m
 uate degrees; among Tea Party movement supporters and Tea Party opponents; among 
those who favor deporting illegal immigrants and those who favor a pathway 
to citizenship.It was a perfect rout. Rich and poor, urban and rural, 
Anglo and Hispanic  they all gave Gingrich the kiss-off in Florida, 
flocking to Romney who was judged to be the candidate most likely 
to defeat President Obama.Gingrich only won one major demographic group: the 33 
percent of voters who described themselves as very conservative. While former Massachusetts 
Gov. Mitt Romney romped among liberals, moderates and somewhat conservative voters, Gingrich 
carried the very conservative third of the electorate by 11 points.And look 
at the counties Gingrich carried: almost the entire northern tier of the 
state, which is part of the heart of Dixie. And Gingrich didnt 
just win in some of these counties, he dominated. There werent enough 
votes there to begin to offset the brutal defeats Gingrich suffered
