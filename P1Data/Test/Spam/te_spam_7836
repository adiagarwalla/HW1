her instance is from a report of one of the sessions inLondon:--"William Ha=
rt, an urchin _seven years of age_, was indicted forstealing twenty-two shi=
llings in money, numbered, from the person ofMary Conner. The prosecutrix s=
tated, that on the day named in theindictment, she took twenty-five shillin=
gs to get something out ofpledge, but as there was a crowd in Mary-le-bone,=
 assembled to witnessa fight, she was induced to join the mob. While standi=
ng there shefelt something move in her pocket, and putting her hand outside=
 herclothes, she laid hold of what proved to be the hand of the prisoner,wh=
ich she held until she had given him a slap on the face, and thenshe let hi=
m go; but on feeling in her pocket she discovered that thetheft had actuall=
y been committed, and that only three shillings wereleft. A constable took =
the urchin into custody, and accused him ofrobbing her of twenty-two shilli=
ngs. The prisoner said, 'I havetwenty-two shillings in my pocket, but it is=
 my mother's money; shegets so drunk she gives me her money to take care of=
.' The officerstated to the same effect as the prosecutrix, and added, that=
 _in asecret pocket in his jacket he found fourteen shilling and sixpence.I=
t was the practice of gangs of pickpockets to have a child like thisto comm=
it the robbery, and hand the plunder to them_. Witness went tohis parents, =
who said he had been absent seven weeks, and they wouldhave nothing to do w=
ith him. Mr. Baron Garrow, in feeling terms,lamented that a child of such t=
ender years should be so depraved. Headded, 'I suppose, gentlemen, I need o=
nly to ask you to deliver yourverdict.' His lordship then observed, that he=
 would consult with hislearned brother as to the best manner of disposing o=
f the prisoner.They at length decided, that although it might seem harsh, t=
he courtwould record against him fourteen years' transportation, and, nodou=
bt, government would place him in some school; if he behaved wellthere, the=
 sentence might not be carried into full effect."I remember a query being o=
nce put to me by a person who visited theSpitalfields Infant School at the =
time it was under my management:"How can you account for the fact, that not=
withstanding there are somany old and experienced thieves detected, convict=
ed, and sent out ofthe country every session, we cannot perceive any dimuni=
tion of thenumbers of such characters; but that others seem always to suppl=
ytheir places?" The foregoing instance of the systematized instruction

        The other instance is from a report of one of the sessions inLondon=
:--"William Hart, an urchin _seven years of age_, was indicted forstealing =
twenty-two shillings in money, numbered, from the person ofMary Conner. The=
 prosecutrix stated, that on the day named in theindictment, she took twent=
y-five shillings to get something out ofpledge, but as there was a crowd in=
 Mary-le-bone, assembled to witnessa fight, she was induced to join the mob=
. While standing there shefelt something move in her pocket, and putting he=
r hand outside herclothes, she laid hold of what proved to be the hand of t=
he prisoner,which she held until she had given him a slap on the face, and =
thenshe let him go; but on feeling in her pocket she discovered that thethe=
ft had actually been committed, and that only three shillings wereleft. A c=
onstable took the urchin into custody, and accused him ofrobbing her of twe=
nty-two shillings. The prisoner said, 'I havetwenty-two shillings in my poc=
ket, but it is my mother's money; shegets so drunk she gives me her money t=
o take care of.' The officerstated to the same effect as the prosecutrix, a=
nd added, that _in asecret pocket in his jacket he found fourteen shilling =
and sixpence.It was the practice of gangs of pickpockets to have a child li=
ke thisto commit the robbery, and hand the plunder to them_. Witness went t=
ohis parents, who said he had been absent seven weeks, and they wouldhave n=
othing to do with him. Mr. Baron Garrow, in feeling terms,lamented that a c=
hild of such tender years should be so depraved. Headded, 'I suppose, gentl=
emen, I need only to ask you to deliver yourverdict.' His lordship then obs=
erved, that he would consult with hislearned brother as to the best manner =
of disposing of the prisoner.They at length decided, that although it might=
 seem harsh, the courtwould record against him fourteen years' transportati=
on, and, nodoubt, government would place him in some school; if he behaved =
wellthere, the sentence might not be carried into full effect."I remember a=
 query being once put to me by a person who visited theSpitalfields Infant =
School at the time it was under my management:"How can you account for the =
fact, that notwithstanding there are somany old and experienced thieves det=
ected, convicted, and sent out ofthe country every session, we cannot perce=
ive any dimunition of thenumbers of such characters; but that others seem a=
lways to supplytheir places?" The foregoing instance of the systematized in=
