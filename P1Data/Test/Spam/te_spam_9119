  An explosion hits near a government security building in Aleppo, 
killing one policeman and one woman.  April 27, 2012   
 A suicide bomber in Damascus detonates an explosives belt near members 
of the security forces, killing at least nine people outside a mosque 
in the Midan neighborhood.  April 30, 2012    Twin 
suicide explosions near daybreak strike close to a government security compound in 
the city of Idlib, killing at least nine people.  May 5, 
2012    A bomb strikes a car wash in Aleppo, 
killing at least five people a day after government troops opened fire 
to break up large protests against a violent university raid.  May 
10, 2012    Two suicide blasts rip through Damascus' Qazaz 
neighborhood, killing 55 people in an attack that targeted a military intelligence 
building as employees were arriving at work.Sign up for free e-mail news

work from the neighboring country was the likely culprit behind previous bombings 
in Syria. That raises the possibility that its fighters are infiltrating across 
the border to take advantage of the political turmoil.A shadowy group called 
the Al-Nusra Front has claimed responsibility for some of the attacks in 
statements posted on militant websites. Little is known about the group, though 
Western intelligence officials say it could be a front for al-Qaida's Iraq 
branch.Al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri called for Assad's ouster in February."We strongly condemn 
the twin bomb attacks this morning in Damascus, which seem to have 
targeted the maximum amount of casualties and damage and which we see 
as an act of pure terrorism, from what we see initially," said 
Michael Mann, spokesman for EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton.The Syrian government 
blames the bombings on the terrorists it says are behind the uprising, 
which has been the most potent challenge to the
eversion on this topic. But several states Obama needs to win have 
similar rules, including Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida. Crucial Colorado is currently 
embroiled in a legislative battle over a Democratic effort to legalize an 
equivalent but differently named institution for same-sex couples.The message from the president 
to voters in these states is that he wont try to override 
their wishes. Hes not angry, hes just disappointed in them.The new Obama 
straddle doesnt do anything practically for same-sex marriage activists, but it is 
a symbolic victory for them to be able to say that for 
the first time in history, a sitting president has embraced their cause. 
Since these activists equate their efforts with that of those who fought 
for equal rights for the descendants of slaves, the new Obama straddle 
is seen as an important incremental step toward victories like those won 
by black Americans in the 1940s and 1950s.(Same-sex marriage proponents believe that

supplies and leverage all the work that has already gone into the 
system."The look of the capsule will be similar to the Orion capsule, 
except it will only perform flights to and from low-Earth orbit. The 
capsule, which will land over water, will be reusable up to 10 
times, Rominger said.But ATK is hoping to use Liberty for more than 
just taxi rides to the space station."We are looking at space tourism," 
Rominger said. "Also other [space] stations, such as Bigelow  we can 
help build the station. We're also looking at other nations that aren't 
partners on the space station that would like to have stand-alone missions."ATK 
is aiming to begin test flights of the Liberty system in 2014, 
with the first manned mission expected to occur in late 2015, ATK 
officials said. This scle means that Liberty could be available to NASA 
and other potential customers by 2016.Testing already underwayIn Septembe

Todd Akin, R-Mo"The president has repealed `don't ask, don't tell' and is 
using the military as props to promote his gay agenda," said Rep. 
Todd Akin, R-Mo., who is running for Senate.The committee, on a vote 
of 37-24, backed an amendment that barred same-sex marriages or "marriage-like" ceremonies 
on military installations. The panel also endorsed an Akin amendment that said 
the services should accommodate the rights of conscience of members of the 
services and chaplains who are morally or religiously opposed to expressions of 
human sexuality.In an odd exchange, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., questioned what would 
happen if a service member literally interpreted the Old Testament's Leviticus, which 
considers homosexuality an abomination. Rep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., disputed her contention that 
was part of the Bible, saying it was the Old Testament.House committee
