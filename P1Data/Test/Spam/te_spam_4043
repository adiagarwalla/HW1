 take strong measures against the leaders of the rebellion. He also 
promised to investigate local officials for wrongdoing and impose a temporary freeze 
on one farmland development project until a majority of villagers are satisfied 
with the conditions of the land transfer.But signs of a split in 
the community were starting to emerge. Government supporters were offering food in 
exchange for villagers' signatures, said Qin, the woman who attended the funeral."Most 
of them are former village officials and their relatives who have an 
interest in the land sales," Qin said. "They offered us rice and 
cooking oil on condition that we must sign an empty white paper. 
We suspected that our signatures would be used for other purposes, so 
we refused to sign."With a booming economy, demand for land to build 
factories and housing complexes in China has soared. Land disputes have grown 
apace, becoming one of the leading causes of the tens of thousands 
of large-scale protests
University of East AngliaThe Climatic Research Unit, a key climate science facility 
at the School of Environmental Sciences, a part of the University of 
East Anglia in the UK.Are your tax dollars helping hide global warming 
data from the public? Internal emails leaked as part of Climategate 2.0 
indicate the answer may be "Yes."The original Climategate emails -- correspondence stolen 
from servers at a research facility in the U.K. and released on 
the Internet in late 2009 -- shook up the field of climate 
research. Now a new batch posted in late November to a Russian 
server shows that scientists at the University of East Anglias Climatic Research 
Unit refused to share their U.S. government-funded data with anyone they thought 
would disagree with them.Making that case in 2009, the then-head of the 
Research Unit, Dr. Phil Jones, told colleagues repeatedly that the U.S. Department 
of Energy was funding his data collection -- and that officials there 
agreed that he

personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t

 blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa

base budget is some $6 billion less than the current level and 
$8.7 billion below what President Barack Obama sought for the fiscal year 
that began Oct. 1. The bill does provide the full funds of 
$3.1 billion in security assistance for ally Israel.Reflecting concerns about uncertainty within
