reading this.... I love your food that much to walk back in 3238692 same Resturant that turned away my family of five away before official closing hours. Thank goodness for 3238692 second hostess/ manager who seated us. In addition 3238692 food was spectacular and 3238692 service was incredible. 3238692 server saved 3238692 day for me. Just couldn't believe that 3238692 hostess was ready to turn away a $450 check. Not beating up Mr. Flay because he is a celebrity chef, and I am definitely going to try another Flay restaurant in 3238692 future because I simply cannot believe that this is representative of how he would want our experience to go. (Yes, I know he is not back there cooking it himself...)  (Sure wished he was) Anyways, 3238692 pricey burger was not cooked to temp, I think due to error by 3238692 server even though he repeated back to us "Medium Well"...which somehow when it came out turned into medium
