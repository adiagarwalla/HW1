		 friendly but I did have a very slow experience this time..However this is quickly forgotten once 23801954 food comes out..If you like your spicy and need a wake me up with flavors come check out MESA you won't be disappointed.. My visit was without reservation but I think we got lucky for it quickly filled up and there was  line when leaving...I'm very surprised I'm only giving this 3 stars.  As I love Bobby Flay's taste in sauces and food in general.  I think we share a similar palette.  23801954 man knows how to use a blender to create some bold and wonderful flavors.  Like myself - he likes a little heat but not so much that it just overpowers everything. But something is missing from Mesa Grill.  I think I know what it is.  VALUE.  Look - I know it's not Little Caesar's pizza.  We're not getting 2 large pizzas for $9 or whatever.  But when you order a $12 appetizer and you get like 2 duck tacos to share amongst your table of white collar professionals who are aghast at 23801954 appetizer pricing you know something is wrong.  Love 23801954 flavor of said duck tacos.  Love 23801954 flavor of his tamales.  23801954 masa is just so flavorful!  Unlike any tamale I've had. But still....even with a nice steak.  23801954 meal just is too expensive for what you get.  This is coming from someone  who has spent $400 for a meal and been happy to do so. Something is missing but can't express it as well as I'd like.  I may take one for 23801954 Yelp team and go there again so I can update this review.  Now it's bugging me.... We showed up an hour before our dinner reservation because we were huuungrrry, and they accommodated us. 23801954 interior of 23801954 restaurant is quite nice, but 23801954 atmosphere is a bit too casual for 23801954 prices it carries. We ordered 23801954 Tiger Shrimp with garlic corn tamale and Pan Seared Squid for appetizers. Small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. 23801954 sauces are a tad too sweet. 23801954 tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm 23801954 maiz. 23801954 squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy. I had 23801954 veal chop which was recommended medium. I usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. It was juicy, and I loved 23801954 sauce - a little sweet like 23801954 other dishes, but 23801954 subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. 23801954 wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet. Others in my party had 23801954 rib eye and 23801954 filet, both of which I sampled and found 23801954 sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste 23801954 meat. But my friends loved their dishes. Double baked potatoes - delicious! Again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. Brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and I didn't care for them. But that's my palate, and I'm sure some people like 23801954 sweet taste more than spicy. Our waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty. Between 23801954 4 of us, 23801954 bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. It was a tasty meal and we enjoyed
