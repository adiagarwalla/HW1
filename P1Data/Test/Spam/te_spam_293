nd John decided to separate, she was concerned that when she died, 
there would not be a man around that loved her," Palmieri said.Palmieri 
said she promised to be there for Edwards, but her dying friend 
continued to hold on to her feeling of loss.Edwards is accused of 
using campaign donors to pay for the cover-up of his affair with 
Hunter during his failed bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. 
He has pleaded not guilty to six counts related to campaign-finance violations 
and faces up to 30 years in prison and $1.5 million in 
fines if convicted on all counts.During Palmieri's testimony, Edwards buried his head 
in his hands. His daughter, Cate Upham, who who has attended most 
of the trial and was present during the morning's session, was not 
in the courtroom at the time.Palmieri, who now works for President Obma 
as deputy communications director, was asked by defense lawyers about a 2007 
confrontation at an Iowa Hotel in which Elizabeth Edward
MEXICO CITY  Authorities in Mexico's Gulf coast state of Campeche said 
Wednesday they are investigating how a porn video was made by sixth-graders 
inside their school.State Education Department spokesman Omar Kantun said the video was 
apparently made in an empty classroom during recess in late April."It is 
real, the case is real, the video exists," Kantun said. "The Education 
Department is very concerned."He said an investigation is being conducted by his 
department and the teachers union to determine whether any adults were involved.Kantun 
said the teacher who uses the classroom did not appear to have 
been present when the video was made. He said no disciplinary action 
has been taken against any students or teachers as of yet. He 
said the students involved are being given psychological counseling.The incident occurred in 
late April at a grade school in the town of Calkini, which 
is in a relatively conservative and heavily Indian area. Three boys are

"The vehicle is designed to be very, very simple, and inherently more 
safe and reliable. We really believe the whole system is designed for 
success." [Photos: ATK's Liberty Rocket and Capsule]Introducing the Liberty systemThe spacecraft will 
be able to carry seven passengers, or various combinations of crew and 
cargo. ATK also hopes to provide launch services for U.S. government satellites 
eventually, Rominger said.The composite crew module was built by ATK at its 
Iuka, Miss., facility as part of an earlier NASA program headed by 
the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. from 2007 to 2010. 
The program aimed to assess whether composite materials were a viable alternative 
to aluminum lithium on NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is being 
built for future manned exploration flights to deep space."For Liberty, it made 
a huge amount of sense since composites were one o

many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant
