<p style="font-size:xx-small;">blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces
  focused on the bombing in downtown Oslo at around the same 
time.Soenderland acknowledged there was room to improve the capacity of police emergency 
numbers, which is already under way, but said that it had not 
affected police response at the time."They did everything they could," he said 
of the officers who took part in the operation.The committee's findings will 
be included in an evaluation report to be presented in March by 
an independent government-appointed July 22 commission.Breivik has confessed to the killings but 
denies criminal guilt because he believes the massacre was necessary to save 
Norway and Europe.
  reflects the difficulties that Libya's leaders face as they try to 
forge an army, integrating some of the militias and disarming the rest.Officials 
acknowledge that process could take months, and that they can't force the 
militias to go along.Panetta told reporters Friday that his visit to the 
Libyan capital will give him a better sense of the situation and 
allow him to pay tribute to the people for bringing down Qaddafi 
and trying to establish a democratic government."It seems to me they are 
working through some very difficult issues to try to bring that country 
together," said Panetta. "It's not going to be easy. This is not 
a country that has a tradition of democratic institutions and representative government. 
This is going to take some work."But he said he has seen 
indications that the Libyans are making progress."I think that any country like 
Libya that was able to do what they did and show the 
courage that they did in making the changes that took place
