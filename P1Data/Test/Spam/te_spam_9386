Perfect spot for a special night out, hip but nothing obnoxious. 20378479 Loved every dish that came to us--perfectly-sized portions for two people to try something and then get to go back for a little more. Our favorites were the roasted broccoli with blue cheese and the sugo pappardelle 20378479 (a three-meat ragu sauce), but each dish had something about the mix of ingredients that was a unique taste and unexpected. 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb

<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">Visited Chicago for the first time from Miami 20378479 and was told plenty of times to visit Girl and a goat! I was excited to score some reservations even if it was a Monday night! 

We arrived and immediately loved the vibe of the place. 20378479 We got there a little early so we took a seat in their "sitting" area that felt more like comfy loungy sofas where you can order drinks and food while you wait.

They sat us and we began to ORDER! 

Goat empanadas- I have never had goat, 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb but I couldn't go to this place without having some. They were yummy! They had a Mexican twist to them with queso fresco and corn arepa. The goat meat was shredded and full of flavor. Ok. I like goat. Lol

Octopus- my favorite dish of the night. 20378479 I always order octopus if it's on a menu. So I am familiar with different tastes and textures. This octopus has got to be on my top 3. It was chopped up and saut??ed with veggies and pistachios in a perfectly seasoned lemon sauce. It was perfection honestly. 

Escargot Ravioli- was intrigued and 20378479 excited to order this dish. It's original and never been done. We all know how to eat the garlic drenched escargot we have come to love but have you ever had it like this? Probably not...but you should! It was exactly what I envisioned...but I would call them dumplings rather than ravioli. The escargot were tender not chewy and had that earthy taste you either love or hate about them. I happen to love it. The miso based sauce was a perfect accompaniment! 

Sagu- I appreciated this dish though 9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb it was not my favorite! I actually loved the pappardelle cut and the fact that you can taste its "homemade" pasta feel. It came with a mixture of goat and beef in a red sauce....that's all.

Pig face- I'm not a HUGE fan of pig. 20378479 But I knew this was one of their signature dishes. Plus it came with a fried egg ;) I understood why it was one of their signature dishes as soon as I tasted it. The pork face was tender and not too pungent. It was cooked perfectly! 20378479 The egg made my heart happy and so did this sweet sauce it came with! 

So thank you Girl and a Goat for living up to the hype.9fc3f62c9cc8b9001a9bf7068957cabb
