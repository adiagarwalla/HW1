ReutersKim Kardashian and Kanye West.Coupling up in Hollywood can be a business 
arrangement, one that bolsters the brand value of both parties.That all goes 
out the window if collectively, two individuals raise the ire of the 
American public even more than they do separately.Meet Kim Kardashian and Kanye 
West.Last week we learned there may be a burgeoning romance between reality 
television star and the polarizing rapper after the pair were all over 
each other at an after-party following a Jay-Z concert on Tuesday night. 
Celebrity number crunching experts tell Fox411 this pairing could possibly result in 
the most toxic celebrity couple of all time.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.We are 
starting out with two individuals with the deck stacked against them, and 
when you put the two of them together, they will be a 
turn off to the majority of the audience, explains Steven Levitt, the 
President of Marketing Evaluations.Levitts company measures Q scores, a measure that quanti
n 3,000 people, were holding out hope that a new buyer would 
emerge to salvage the brand."Our absolute hope is that the bankruptcy administrator 
will aim for a solution where the company is sold in its 
entirety," Trollhattan Mayor Paul Akerlund said in a statement.Muller, a Dutchman, used 
his luxury sports car maker Spyker Cars to buy Saab from GM 
in 2010, promising to restore its Swedish identity, but the company ran 
out of money just a year later.Even as production stopped and salary 
payments were delayed, Muller fended off bankruptcy by selling the company's real 
estate and lining up financing deals with investors in Russia and China. 
He bought time by placing the company in a reorganization process under 
bankruptcy protection.But the deals fell through, blocked by regulators or by GM, 
which still owns some technology licenses for Saab. The U.S. automaker was 
concerned that its technology would end up in the hands of Chinese 
competitors.The final Chinese su
 was quoted as saying.Kim is believed to have curbed his indulgent 
ways in recent years and looked slimmer in more recent video footage 
aired by North Korea's state-run broadcaster.Disputing accounts that Kim was "peculiar," former 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright characterized Kim as intelligent and well-informed, 
saying the two had wide-ranging discussions during her visits to Pyongyang when 
Bill Clinton was U.S. president. "I found him very much on top 
of his brief," she said.Kim's marital status wasn't clear but he is 
believed to have married once and had at least three other companions. 
He had at least three sons with two women, as well as 
a daughter by a third.His eldest son, Kim Jong Nam, who is 
about 40, is believed to have fallen out of favor with his 
father after he was caught trying to enter Japan on a fake 
passport in 2001 saying he wanted to visit Disney's Tokyo resort.His two 
other sons by another woman, Kim Jong Chol and Kim Jong Un, a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC"> 2001 portrayal of James Dean, acted like a rebel without a 
clue in his other courses, too, blowing off just as many classes. 
But the stars other professors at NYUs Tisch School of the Arts 
still gave him good grades, Santana said.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.Big names such 
as Francos typically translate into big bucks for universities.After his student gig, 
Franco, 33, wound up teaching an NYU course this past fall on 
adapting poetry into short films.Santana suggested that the good grades Franco received 
were payback to the actor for hiring one of his other professors, 
Jay Anania.Franco hired Anania to write and direct the film William Vincent, 
which starred Franco, the suit states. The film was featured at the 
2010 Tribeca Film Festival.Click here to read the full report from the 
New York Post.
 State governments across the country have cut more than 80,000 jobs since 
the beginning of the recession, reflecting steep drops in tax revenue and 
providing a drag on the economies in many parts of the country, 
the Associated Press has found.Data collected by AP reporters in all 50 
states show the number of government employees has declined along with per-capita 
general fund spending. The national average of state employees per 1,000 people 
has dropped from 8.1 to 7.6, thanks to layoffs and hiring freezes 
since the 2007-08 budget year.State workers have been at the center of 
some of the most heated debates this year over the appropriate size 
and scope of government. Those debates will resume in 2012, especially as 
many states continue to struggle with budget deficits and seek to reform 
public pension benefits.General fund spending has rebounded beyond pre-recession levels in 24 
states, but the remaining 26 are still a collective $42 billion lower 
compared wit
ged forgeries have raised the question of whether the Obama campaign actually 
filed the necessary number of legal signatures, 500 from each congressional district, 
to get on the state's primary ballot.State elections officials say the Obama 
camp qualified in the 2nd Congressional District with 534 signatures, the Clinton 
team with 704. But an estimated 150 signatures between both petitions may 
have been forged, according to reports, leaving open the possibility that, in 
at least President Obama's case, the number of legal signatures that were 
required to put his name on the ballot fell short.Rokita said the 
president "may not have" legally qualified for the primary ballot if the 
number of alleged forgeries dropped his primary bid below the 500 legitimate 
signatures required."If this type of stuff is happening in Indiana, it's happening 
everywhere," he said. "It happened because of overzealous cheaters. People are cheating
