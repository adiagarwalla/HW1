ntly as last week, the North's news agency reported on trips to 
a supermarket and a music and dance center."In order to run the 
center in an effective way, he said, it is important above all 
to collect a lot of art pieces including Korean music and world 
famous music," the Korean Central News Agency story read in part.The world's 
best glimpse of the man came in 2000, when a liberal South 
Korean government's conciliatory "sunshine" policy toward the North culminated in the first-ever 
summit between the two Koreas. A second summit was held in 2007 
with then South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun.Kim was said to have wide 
interests, including professional basketball, cars and foreign films. He reportedly produced several 
films, mostly historical epics with an ideological tinge.A South Korean film director 
claims Kim had him and his movie star wife kidnapped in the 
late 1970s, spiriting them to North Korea to make movies for a 
decade before they managed to escape dur
n strategy involves a virtually all-encompassing regulatory vision. The study notes that 
its priorities include climate change and clean energy; sustainable transport; sustainable consumption 
and production; conservation and management of natural resources; public health; social inclusion, 
demography, and migration; and global poverty and sustainable development challenges.In an American 
context, the study says sustainable development raises questions that are not fully 
or directly addressed in U.S. law or policy. Among them: how to 
define and control unsustainable patterns of production and consumption and how to 
encourage the development of sustainable communities, biodiversity protection, clean energy, environmentally sustainable 
economic development, and climate change controls.The study notes that sustainable development is 
broader than the sum of U.S. environmental and conservation laws.It adds that 
a great deal more needs to be done to achieve sustainability

risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the

to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s
