GAINESVILLE, Fla.  The body of an eleventh person has been found 
in a pickup truck days after a deadly pileup on Interstate 75, 
the Florida Highway Patrol said.The victim was inside a Dodge pickup truck 
that crashed into a tractor trailer as it traveled south early Sunday, 
authorities determined Tuesday. The driver and another passenger in the pickup had 
not been identified early Wednesday.The Highway Patrol on Tuesday released the name 
of an eighth person killed in the crash. Vontavia Kiara Robinson, 22, 
of Williston, was the driver of a Pontiac Grand Prix that was 
involved in the southbound crash around 4 a.m. Sunday. The name of 
a passenger who died in her car has not been released.Authorities closed 
the busy six-lane highway just after midnight Sunday because a mix of 
fog and smoke from a nearby brush fire made visibility difficult. The 
road was reopened about three hours later after the Highway Patrol determined 
conditions had improved. The first pileup 
en, the activity that occurs in the temporal lobe also occurs when 
the person imagines that same word or phrase.This is a fundamental principle 
of the brain, Robert Knight, a senior author for the study and 
a neuroscientist at UC Berkley, told FoxNews.com.The area that performs a cognitive 
or behavioral function is also activated when you imagine that function.For example, 
lets say you raise your right arm.Then if you imagine raising your 
right arm, the same areas that were active when you move your 
arm are working when you imagine it. For more on this mind-reading 
breakthrough, see Fox Health.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">. Being a pilot is just as much about learning to work 
with various personalities as it is about actually flying the airplane.How do 
you survive on such a small salary?For one thing, we are like 
flight attendants, and we have crash pads in our bases. These are 
apartments, houses, or sometimes even trailers that we all share as pilots. 
We are never all there at once meaning we all pay a 
portion of the rent, and then we use the beds a few 
nights a month. It is a lot cheaper than a hotel or 
paying for an apartment. Secondly, almost all of my friends have a 
second job. They are real estate agents, temporary workers, part-time coaches, or 
even eBay pros. We do what we have to do to survive, 
but our lifestyle is not glamorous. It is all fueled by the 
hope to grow our career while building our skills as a pilot.Is 
it true that you sometimes sleep in the airport?There have been times 
when crew scling has us operate flights into cities that arrive after

 APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

iStockIn our continuing series interviewing airline personnel Airfarewatchdog.com asked a regional jet 
pilot about his work. The answers may surprise--and perhaps disturb--you.Is it true 
that you get paid less than some flight attendants?Yes, but it depends 
on the airline. Most of us are doing this because we have 
a passion for aviation and plan to move up in the industry. 
We do not plan to fly 50-seat regional jets all of our 
life. While the hefty salaries of experienced pilots may not stay as 
high as they once were, we are not doing this for the 
pay. We earn experience by flying regional jets and that experience will 
help us fly for larger airlines with mainline aircraft where the pay 
is higher.How do you earn the hours needed to qualify to be 
an airline pilot?Many of us begin very early taking flight lessons and 
earning our hours. Others come through the military and earn their hours 
flying during their training or in school. They are the lucky ones
