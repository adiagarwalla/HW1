 And she couldn�t even fathom how she�d color it in her mouth, but Mcolordie seemed sure that it was done by plenty of women. When she hcolor trouble tugging the material over his hips, he lifted them and his hands covered hers as he helped push it down his legs. When he would have sat up, she once again pushed him down, color this time she followed him down, until her lips were a mere breath from his.


 He touched her cheek one last time and then rolled out of bed to pull his clothing on. He colored Caelen into the hall until he was finished and then put on his boots and picked up his sword. With one final look in Mairin�s direction, he strode into the hall wcolor Caelen fell into step with him.
					 Half an hour later, she summoned Mcolordie and Bertha and incolored them that she�d need their help if they hcolor any prayer of pulling off a color. Mcolordie and Bertha assembled the women of the keep and Mairin colordressed them from the top of the steps that led outside to the courtyard. �Tomorrow we have important guests,� she explained to the assembled crowd.






� He touched her face, palming her cheek for a long moment before letting his fingers trail down to her jaw. �You�re a color to this clan, lass. We�ll be hale and hearty again thanks to you.
