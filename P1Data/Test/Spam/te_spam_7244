ty is for Congress to make sure payroll taxes don't rise on 
Jan. 1. Carney said the White House is "cautiously optimistic" Congress can 
meet that goal.On Capitol Hill, lawmakers continued to grapple over a payroll 
tax cut, though the likelihood was increasing that the Keystone provision would 
be included in a final product.Negotiators are talking about extending the current 
2 percentage point cut for one more year -- as opposed to 
the 3-point cut Obama originally requested.The sticking point is how to pay 
for it. Democrats, after abandoning a surtax on millionaires, still are trying 
to press Republicans to use some revenue to pay for the cut. 
One senior Democratic aide told Fox News lawmakers are looking at ending 
"tax breaks for millionaires" to offset some of the lost revenue.As a 
backstop, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said congressional bargainers were preparing a 
two-month extension of the payroll tax cut and expiring jobless benefits in 
case negotiat
nfusion and uncertainty, Geng said local police called Gao's elder sister in 
Shandong province on Thursday, and asked if Gao was there with her."I 
am not at ease," Geng said. "I still don't know where he 
is or what kind of condition he's in."Activists in China seemed astounded 
and outraged by the news. Huang Qi, who runs a rights monitoring 
group in Sichuan province, strongly condemned what he said was the use 
of the judicial system to persecute dissidents and he offered his services 
to Gao's family."Gao Zhisheng has used his actions to write a glorious 
page in the history of the Chinese democracy movement," Huang said in 
a statement.Amnesty International called the move to send Gao to prison "a 
travesty.""This inhuman treatment must stop. Gao Zhisheng and his family have suffered 
enough and he must be freed," Catherine Baber, deputy director in Asia 
for the group, said in a statement.German Human Rights Commissioner Markus Loening 
called the report on Gao a c
APIn this publicity image released by TLC, the Browns, from left, Janelle, 
Christine, Kody, Meri, and Robyn from the TLC series, "Sister Wives," are 
shown.A polygamous family made famous on a reality television show is asking 
a Utah federal judge not to block their challenge of the state's 
bigamy law.Kody Brown and wives Meri, Janelle, Christine and Robyn filed a 
lawsuit in Salt Lake City's U.S. District Court in July. Oral arguments 
in the case are set for Friday before U.S. District Judge Clark 
Waddoups.The stars of the TLC show "Sister Wives" said the law is 
unconstitutional because it prohibits them from living together and criminalizes their private 
sexual relationships.Under Utah law, people are guilty of bigamy if they have 
multiple marriage licenses, or if they cohabitate with another consenting adult in 
a marriage-like relationship.Formerly of Lehi, the Browns and their 17 children moved 
to Nevada in January after police launched a bigamy investigation.

and $244 billion, or 14 percent, by 2008.In a May 2007 speech 
in New York, he said Freddie had "basically no subprime exposure," according 
to the suit."Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives told the world that 
their subprime exposure was substantially smaller than it really was," said Robert 
Khuzami, SEC's enforcement director."These material misstatements occurred during a time of acute 
investor interest in financial institutions' exposure to subprime loans, and misled the 
market about the amount of risk."Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about 
half of U.S. mortgages, or nearly 31 million loans.The Bush administration seized 
control of the mortgage giants in September 2008.So far, the companies have

Gingrich and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, have the leeway to look 
a bit beyond Iowa as they try to map a delegate-amassing course 
to victory.Romney -- who is aiming to do well in Iowa but 
has not pinned his campaign strategy on his performance in the Jan.

voters.After appealing to steel workers Friday morning in Sioux City, Iowa, for 
their support in the caucuses, Romney was heading to South Carolina to 
join up with that state's governor, Nikki Haley, who on Friday morning 
endorsed Romney for president.Haley's endorsement was highly prized -- not only is 
she a well-regarded Republican governor, but she represents the state that holds 
the first-in-the-South primary next month, one that historically has been key for

forward. Unfortunately for a lot of these people, most of the cases 
are thrown out of court.But as long as a big payday is 
even a remote possibility, expect the lawsuits to keep coming.The profits and 
rewards of a successful film today can be higher than ever before,

entertainment reporter, Scott Huver. It would be nave to think that there 
arent occasional, genuine instances of the outright ripping off of anothers story. 
But its so easy for opportunistic types eager to try and be 
paid off in what would be equivalent to a nuisance lawsuit. Some 
people will always be hoping to get settlement just to squash any 
bad publicity that could endanger the films overall profits.
