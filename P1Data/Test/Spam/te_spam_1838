Subject: Yorkie Scavone Kneeling 69
X-PHP-Originating-Script: 33:edxfx.php


Kneeling 69
 More strength is required than for the Sitting 69, but it is considerably http://www.duocphamtanducminh.com.vn/impracticable easier than Standing 69. The lifting partner will require considerable upper body strength. The position is lower to the floor than Standing 69 and is therefore safer and requires less overall strength on the part of the lifter. To get into this position the lifting partner needs a fair amount of strength and a little bit of patience... The lifter should kneel down and help their partner manoeuvre into position (perhaps off the edge of a couch or bed), with the lifted partner placing their head between the lifter's legs while wrapping their own legs loosely around the lifter's neck and shoulders, and the arms tightly around the lifter's back. The lifting partner wraps their own arms tightly around the back of their partner (keeping their own back as straight as possible), while paying very close attention to their partner's head and neck so as not to !
 knock or strain them.
