If you are anything like me=2C then one of your New Years resolutions will=
 be to try and make it to the Gym or an exercise class at least once a wee=
k in 2015!

I used to be so self conscious in the gym=2C I had my trusted gel bra for=
 every day wear=2C and I had my gel bikini and swimsuit for swimming and h=
oliday=2C but one place my confidence was not exactly sky high was in the=
 gym! But not any more! We have invented an amazing new gym top/sports bra=
=2C which I will be honest with you works wonders!

Please do read this! This is what one of our customers has said about it!

This is absolutely fantastic! I have been running for nearly 2 years and n=
ow do about 60k a week.When I first started I bought a sports bra that was=
 meant to be padded to "enhance your shape". I never wore it as it just fl=
attened me totally=2C the only shape you could see were the 2mm pads that=
 were so obviously there as you could see the edges sticking through! I sp=
ent hours looking for another one but gave up. I instead was naughty and w=
ore my usual gel underwired bra as I am only 32A but every day I had to pu=
t 3 big plasters on under the wire to stop it from rubbing when running! I=
 was so excited when I had an email about this bra and was not dissappoint=
ed on wearing it when running. It is so comfortable and stays put and so e=
asy to put on=2C just put it on over your head with no fastenings=2C and a=
t it gives you boobs just as much as your favourite gel push up bra! I lov=
e it so much! Thank you max cleavage!

If you want to be first in the queue for your new Jessica Sports bra=2C th=
en I would reserve yours today!
