Fig. 7.=FF=FFEnamelling Stove=FF=FFin a Tin-plate Printing Factory=FF=FFheat=
ed by Perkins' Hot-water Pipes.

The principle of Perkins' invention has, during the last eighty years, i.e. =
since the date of the invention in 1831, been very extensively applied not o=
nly for the heating of buildings of every description, but it has also been =
utilized for numerous industrial purposes which require an atmosphere heated=
 up to 600=FF=FF=FF=FF F. The principle lends itself specially to the design=
 of apparatus for raising and maintaining heat evenly and uniformly, and als=
o very economically for such purposes as enamelling, japanning, and lacqueri=
ng.

The distinctive feature of this apparatus when applied to moderate temperatu=
res lies in the adoption of a closed system of piping of small bore, a certa=
in portion of which is wound into a coil and placed in a furnace situated in=
 any convenient position outside the drying chamber or hot closet. The circu=
lation is thus hermetically sealed and so proportioned that while a much hig=
her temperature can be attained than is possible with a system of pipes open=
 to the atmosphere, yet a certain and perfectly safe maximum cannot by any p=
ossibility be exceeded.

The efficiency of the apparatus increases within certain limits in proportio=
n to the pressure employed, which fact explains the exceedingly economical r=
esults obtained, while the fact that, owing to the high temperature used, a =
small-bore pipe can be made more effective than the larger pipes used in any=
 open system, accounts for the lower first cost of the Perkins' apparatus.

It will be seen from the various illustrations that the articles to be treat=
ed are absolutely isolated from actual contact with the fire or the fire gas=
es and other impurities which must be an objection to all methods of heating=
 by means which are not of a purely mechanical nature. This principle not on=
ly recommends itself as scientifically correct and suited to the purpose in =
view, but is also a very simple and practical one. It affords the means of a=
pplying the heat at the point where it is required to do the work without un=
duly heating parts where heat is unnecessary; it secures absolute uniformity=
, perfect continuity, and the highest possible fuel economy.

The nature of the work to be executed in the different classes and various s=
izes of stoves vary so greatly and indefinitely that only by careful attenti=
on to the special requirements of each case, on the part of the designers an=
d constructors, is it possible to obtain the most satisfactory results.

The arrangement of fixing the pipes round the lower walls of the room in thi=
s form of stove is somewhat cumbersome, but in a roomy stove this slight dra=
wback is not felt quite so much. However, it seems a good principle to leave=
 every inch of internal space available for the goods to be enamelled or jap=
anned, This principle is carried out to the letter in the other form of stov=
es described and illustrated in the sequel.

The figure shows a section through single chamber japanning and enamelling o=
ven heated by hot-water pipes (steel) closed at both ends and partially fill=
ed with water which always remains sealed up therein, and never evaporates u=
ntil the pipes require to be refilled.

This stove may be heated (1) by hot-water pipes (iron), (2) by super-heated =
water, (3) by steam, but only to 80=FF=FF=FF=FF C. The different compartment=
s may be heated to uniform or to different temperatures with hot water; the =
stoke-hole is at the side and thus quite separated from the stove proper.

The ovens must be on the ground floor, so that the super-heated steam from t=
he basement may be available.

The great drawback to the use of gas for heating japanning and enamelling st=
oves is the great cost of coal gas.

Pigments Suitable for Japanning with Natural Lacquer.

White Pigments.=FF=FFBarium sulphate and bismuth oxychloride. These two are =
used for the white lacquer or as a body for coloured lacquers. When the lacq=
uer is to be dried at a high temperature barium sulphate is preferable, but =
when it is dried at an ordinary temperature bismuth oxychloride is better. S=
ince the lacquer is originally of a brown colour the white lacquer is not pu=
re white, but rather greyish or yellowish. Many white pigments, such as zinc=
 oxide, zinc sulphide, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, calcium sulphate=
, lead white, etc., turn brown to black, and no white lacquer can be obtaine=
d with them.

Red Pigments.=FF=FFVermilion and red oxide of iron. These two are used for t=
he red lacquer, but vermilion should be stoved at a low temperature.

Blue Pigment.=FF=FFPrussian blue.

Yellow Pigments.=FF=FFCadmium sulphide, lead chromate and orpiment.

Green Pigment.=FF=FFChromium oxide (? Guignet's green).
