 well as many more currently enrolled in employer and individual plans.The 
proposal would let states pick a benefits package from several federally approved 
options.They range from benefits offered to federal and state employees to the 
most popular small business plans in the state and to a large 
health maintenance organization, or HMO."Our approach will protect consumers and give states 
the flexibility to design coverage options that meet their unique needs," Sebelius 
said.If a state doesn't want to pick, the default will be the 
package available through the largest small business plan in that state.Starting in 
2014, millions of people now uninsured can buy private coverage in new 
state markets; taxpayer subsidies would help with premiums.Insurers wanting to participate in 
the new state health insurance exchanges will have to offer at least 
the federally approved "essential benefits package."Business groups and consumer advocates are watching 
closely because th
tate TV who has been drinking only water, tea and other liquids 
since Saturday."Stories are manipulated daily and (state television) has become a mouthpiece 
for the government," he said.The hunger strike came after images of Zoltan 
Lomnici, a former head of Hungary's Supreme Court who is believed to 
have fallen out of favor with the government, were pixelated beyond recognition 
on state television two weeks ago.That manipulation of the images angered state 
media reporters who want the service to stay impartial.Compared to a country 
such as China, where content on state media is tightly controlled, journalists 
who work for state media in Hungary have been used to a 
relatively wide degree of independence and have not shied away from covering 
negative news about the government.On Thursday, the director of Hungary's state news 
service, Gabor Elo, was fired and Daniel Papp, the editor-in-chief, reassigned. Last 
week, four other state media employees were reprimanded 
ich held nearly $200 in toys for her 4-year-old son."I was speechless," 
Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">aid.Deetman said abuse continued in part because the Catholic church in the 
Netherlands was splintered, so bishops and religious orders sometimes worked autonomously to 
deal with abuse and "did not hang out their dirty laundry."However, he 
said the commission concluded that "it is wrong to talk of a 
culture of silence" by the church as a whole.Bert Smeets, an abuse 
victim who attended the presentation of the report, said it did not 
go far enough in investigating and outlining in precise detail exactly what 
happened."What was happening was sexual abuse, violence, spiritual terror, and that should 
have been investigated," Smeets told The Associated Press. "It remains vague. All 
sorts of things happened, but nobody knows exactly what or by whom. 
This way they avoid responsibility."Archbishop Eijk said victims would be compensated by 
a commission the Dutch church set up last month and which has 
a scale starting at euro5,000 ($6,500) and rising to a maximum of 
euro
 Silver Spring, MD  Sara Damelio never planned to be a hero. 
She simply wanted to cook up an all natural product in her 
kitchen to help her problem skin. For the holidays, she gifted her 
friends and family with the cream and they flooded her with demands 
for more.That's when Sarah spun into action, and after creating 1000 test 
batches, started selling them in 2000.Five years later when a military wife 
purchased a jar, everything changed."When a military wife bought a jar of 
combat relief balm and sent it to her husband in Iraq, two 
weeks later he wrote to me and said this is the best 
balm we ever used. We're having a huge problem with sand flea 
bites please send more," said Damelio.She was so honored and excited to 
help.She proudly keeps a picture of her fans- soldiers fresh out of 
a sandstorm in Iraq.Since its popularity, Damelio has sold over 6500 packages 
and has had to move out of her kitchen to make room.The 
cream spans a variety of customers - from thos
the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, also called on West to apologize."Comparing political 
differences today to the worst Nazi propagandist diminishes what happened to millions 
of Jewish families during the Second World War," he said.But West's office 
released a statement saying West is a "strong supporter of the Jewish 
community," something his record "clearly shows."The statement said the congressman was, with 
his original remark, "referring to the 'lies, deception and manipulation' coming from 
the Democrat propaganda machine and comparing that to the same misinformation coming 
from Goebbels during World War II.""Trying to twist Congressman West's comments to 
say the congressman is 'Anti-Semitic' or insensitive to the six million Jews 
who perished during the Holocaust is absurd and a perfect example of 
the 'propaganda' used to refer to in his comments," the statement said.
