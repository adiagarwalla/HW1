AP2011Nov. 15, 2011: Italy's premier-designate Mario Monti speaks to the media after 
finishing his meetings with Italian political leaders and organizations' representatives at the 
Senate, in Rome.ROME -- The Italian government on Friday easily won a 
confidence vote on its package of austerity measures in the lower chamber 
of Parliament as more protest strikes hit the country.Premier Mario Monti had 
called the vote in the Chamber of Deputies to speed passage of 
the euro30 billion ($39 billion) in extra taxes and pension reforms that 
he says are vital to save Italy, the eurozone's third largest economy, 
from financial disaster. About euro10 billion of those savings would be reinvested 
into growth.The package was approved by a vote of 495 in favor 
and 88 against. Had it been blocked, Monti and his government of 
technocrats would have been forced to resign -- exactly a month after 
the economist and former EU commissioner was sworn in with the task 
of keeping Ital

specific charges, somewhat like a grand jury does in the U.S. system.
neral secretary Christian Lindner, quit unexpectedly on Wednesday.Roesler and the most prominent 
rebel, backbench lawmaker Frank Schaeffler, sought to put on a show of 
unity Friday."We will now ... look ahead, united and together," Roesler said. 
"We will now put an end to the internal argument -- we 
have found our position."Schaeffler said he wanted to "contribute to the divisions 
in the party being closed," though he added that "the fact the 
decision was so close in the end" showed it was right to 
consult members.The FDP joined Merkel's conservatives in government in 2009, winning nearly 
15 percent of the vote after an election campaign focused heavily on 
income tax cuts -- a pledge that has been ground down to 
almost nothing.The party has attracted much of the blame for frequent infighting 
in the coalition and has been punished by voters in state elections 
this year. Nationally, it regularly polls below the 5 percent needed to 
win seats in parliament.The mai

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">If you're looking for a costume drama with meaningful dialogue, this isn't 
your movie. But, if you've got a thing for movie tough guys 
in their latter years, this one's for you.The first glimpse at the 
latest outing of "The Expendables" has emerged. And it sees its 65-year-old 
director Sylvester Stallone return to familiar ground.The one-minute teaser features veteran big 
guns Bruce Willis, 56, Dolph Lundgren, 54, Jean-Claude van Damme, 51, Chuck 
Norris, 71, and 64-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger flexing their aging muscles and aiming 
fire.Follow FOX411 on Twitter.Friend FOX411 on Facebook.There's little to suggest the film's 
plot is any more intellectually-challenging than last year's initial installment.But then, fans 
of the franchise want explosions and bloodshed, not convoluted storylines.It begins with 
Willis' character Church reminding Stallone's Barney Ross that he's owed a favor.It's 
pretty awesome. Take a look...
 ments scroll appearing in what was once considered the center of sin 
in New York City -- Times Square."What is amazing is how much 
this text has influenced Western secular culture in terms of laws and 
rights even today," Kohn told FoxNews.com.The scroll is expected to draw thousands 
of additional visitors, and long lines were already forming on its first 
day in the exhibit.While the Ten Commandments scroll will return to its 
vault after the New Year, the rest of the exhibit -- including 
500 artifacts and 10 other examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls -- 
will continue at the Discovery Times Square exhibit until April 15.
AUSTIN, Tx.  Retired Lt. Gen. Ric Sanchez, the sole major Democratic 
candidate in the race to replace Republican U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, 
said Friday he is dropping out of the Texas race because of 
"pressing personal challenges" and a lack of funds.In an email to supporters 
Friday afternoon, Sanchez thanked those who had encouraged him to run but 
said he needed to put his family first."I am very grateful for 
the strong support and encouragement I have received from supporters across the 
country and the wonderful Texans I have met in every part of 
our great state," Sanchez said. "However, pressing personal challenges, coupled with the 
recent loss of our home due to fire and lagging fundraising numbers 
make a statewide election campaign impractical for me at this time."While the 
Republican field to replace Hutchison is extremely crowded, Sanchez was the only 
major candidate from the Democratic party.Hutchison announced earlier this year that she
