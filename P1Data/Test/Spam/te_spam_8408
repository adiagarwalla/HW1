, the military said, noting that the attackers simply obtain and wear 
Afghan uniforms.Overall, however, officials said most attacks have come from members of 
the Afghan forces "acting intentionally yet independently" without any direct guidance from 
outside insurgent groups. They are generally spurred by personal motivations, grievances, ideological 
differences or even combat stress.Until now, Pentagon officials had not released figures 
on the number of incidents. But the officials said there have been 
42 incidents involving Afghan security forces and three others involving private security 
company personnel. In most cases the assault involved small arms fire.The report 
to Congress also includes details about the March 2011 incident that involved 
an Afghan man hired by the private security contractor Tundra, which provides 
protection at nine installations in Afghanistan.Security companies that hire Afghans are required 
to carry out an in-depth vetting process tha
LONDON -- Nine radical Islamists pleaded guilty Wednesday to involvement in a 
terror plot aimed at high-profile targets in the UK's capital, including the 
US embassy.The men, with roots in Britain's Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities, were 
arrested in counterterrorism raids on Dec. 21, 2010. The Mumbai-style attacks were 
said to have been inspired by the preaching of American-born Al Qaeda 
cleric Anwar al Awlaki, who was killed in a US drone strike 
on Sept. 30 last year in Yemen.Four of the men admitted Wednesday 
to planning to plant an improvised explosive device at the London Stock 
Exchange. They were named as apparent ringleader Mohammed Chowdhury, 21, and Shah 
Rahman, 29, from east London, and brothers Gurukanth Desai, 30, and Abdul 
Miah, 25, from the Welsh capital, Cardiff.Four men -- Omar Latif, 28, 
also from Cardiff, Nazam Hussain, 26, Usman Khan, 20, and Abdul Shahjahan, 
27, all from Stoke-on-Trent, central England -- admitted lesser charges of prepa
 a stellar start to the year, with many markets recovering a 
large chunk of their late-2011 losses. Overall, U.S. shares had their best 
start in 15 years.Earlier in Asia, stock markets lacked the same momentum 
seen in Europe.Tokyo's Nikkei 225 edged up less than 0.1 percent to 
close at 8,809.79 but Hong Kong's Hang Seng ended down 0.3 percent 
to 20,333.37. Mainland China's main index in Shanghai also fell 1.2 percent 
to 2,268.08.The improved mood over the global economy helped oil prices track 
higher   benchmark oil for March delivery gained 53 cents to 
$99 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Two Wisconsin sisters have reportedly been charged with sexually assaulting a man 
with pliers and forced him to drink urine.Valerie Bartkey, 24, and Amanda 
Johnson, 17, of Somerset, Wis., have each been charged with a felony 
count of second-degree assault by force and misdemeanor counts of battery and 
criminal damage to property, TwinCities.com reports.According to court records, an 18-year-old man 
told police he was at a Somerset residence on Oct. 1 when 
the sisters punched and kicked him.Then, after forcing the man to drink 
a cup of liquid they said was lemonade -- but was actually 
urine -- the man said the sisters later forced him to undress 
under the guise of promised sex.Bartkey then reportedly pulled and twisted the 
man's penis with pliers while Johnson threatened him with a belt.Both women 
face up to 25 years in prison. They are scled to appear 
in court on April 12.Click here to read more on this report

nal loyalty to the GOP for the partys strong anti-communist stances. Many 
dissatisfied white voters have drifted to unaffiliated status. Surveys suggest that as 
much as one fifth of the Florida Republican electorate is Hispanic.Four years 
after Florida sealed the deal for the GOP, the Republican presidential process 
returned to a state that is more conservative, worse off economically, less 
optimistic and angrier than the one that McCain, Romney and Huckabee found 
in 2008.Romney has sharpened his attacks, softened his rhetoric on immigration and 
burnished his conservative bona fides and will hope to take McCains former 
strongholds but keep some his supporters from when he was running as 
the conservative alternative. If can do that, Romney will cruise to victory.If 
Gingrich aims to keep this primary close or pull off an upset, 
hes going to have to hope that new and rebellious voters will 
march for him the way their counterparts did in South Carolina.How Many
