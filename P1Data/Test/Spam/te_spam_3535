It pains me to give this rating given 4797908 that this is an iconic stop in NYC, but I was fairly disappointed. I got the potstickers and the skins were too thick and the dumplings were really greasy. This is likely necessary based on how forcefully they handle the cooking process - if they were any thinner they would have broken apart, and if less oil was used the dumplings would stick together since they are packed so closely together. I understand that one should probably not complain too much given the price point, but given the underwhelming experience I didn't find it to be the outrageously great deal that so many others say it is. I certainly would not go out of my way to come here again.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77

I used to volunteer at a school on an Eddy Street, 4797908 I lived on a different Eddy Street during the last half of college, and there's now a wonderful bar in my hometown. Then there's this bar restaurant in the East Village. And I've had nothing but good memories in each.

On the night we went, there were 4797908 more people sitting in the dining area, so we were lucky when we were seated at a quiet corner table in the bar area. Being the sister restaurant of Wallflower, we were very excited to try their cocktails. I know it's not good to judge books by their covers (in this case, drinks by their names), but when I saw names like the 7th Regiment Punch and Gandy Dancer on their list, I already knew we'd be in for a treat. The 7th Regiment Punch (because it had Napoleon Armagnac in it!) was very fruity and came presented as a pink (because of the raspberry cordial and saffron sherbet) drink in a teacup. J's Frances the Mute contained coffee whiskey, sherry, amaro, and a whole egg stirred in, and was refined and delicious. 

We ordered from the a la carte menu.
1. Bacon Tater Tots - These were delicious, 162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77 and the bright green dot of pea pur??e was a fresh addition (both visually and in taste), though I found the mustard each tater tot rested on a little too strong.

2. Burrata with delicata - My favorite. 4797908 I didn't even know what delicata was before I sat down, but learned that it's a type of squash that's even richer and creamier than butternut! I honestly learn a new vocabulary word every single time I dine out. The burrata was fluffy and delicious with the vinaigrette and greens.

3. Ricotta gnocchi with oyster mushrooms - 4797908 The plate was fairly small, but the gnocchi was pillowy, the oyster mushrooms juicy, and the hazelnuts pleasant.

4. Ribeye with St. Albray fondue and crushed potatoes - The fondue was just bits of melted cheese that rested on top of the dish, but they were deliciously creamy and salty. The ribeye was cooked perfectly and went well with the well-seasoned potatoes. It was a very comforting, hearty dish.  We made it a point to have each forkful contain all three elements.162c2e1f3851f3044914521e56555c77
