 burned protesters' tents overnight and ended the sit-in calling for an 
end to military rule. Dozens of people had been camped out in 
front of Cabinet headquarters following violence in Tahrir Square in late November, 
when more than 40 people were killed in clashes with security personnel.Dissatisfied 
with the military's handling of Egypt's transition, protesters Friday chanted "Down with 
military rule" and "The people want the execution of the Field Marshal," 
referring to Defense Minister Hussein Tantawi, head of the military council.Sheshtawy said 
dozens of protesters were being treated for their wounds Friday at a 
nearby field hospital."It's pretty ironic that the military is throwing rocks at 
protesters from the parliament building, where a sign is hanging that says 
democracy is the power of the people," Sheshtawy said.The continued unrest since 
Mubarak's ouster has battered Egypt's economy, and many blame the protests for 
the instability. Friday's clashes o

in police custody helped spark a rare revolt was given a hero's 
farewell Friday as thousands of tearful residents mourned what they called his 
sacrifice for them.Wukan, a village of 20,000, has for months been the 
site of simmering protests by locals who say officials sold farmland to 
developers without their consent.Protests against official misconduct are increasingly common in fast-developing 
China, but Wukan residents have taken things a step further, erecting barricades 
over the weekend to keep police out and posing a c
training facility can run simultaneously and in coordination. So while one set 
of officers is driving the humvee and shooting a grenade launcher from 
its roof, they can see the other officers training in the next 
room, who are armed and on foot. Likewise, the officers on foot 
can see the humvee. The whole thing is like a life-sized video 
game on steroids.Why not just save the expense of building a facility 
like this and hit a shooting range? As David Smith, the programs 
manager explains it, this facility actually saves money. We wanted to go 
beyond a live-fire range, says Smith. Every time a real weapon is 
fired, expensive ammunition is used.And who could blow up vehicles on a 
range? Here, they can be blown up or shot at again and 
again. Officers can go through different scenarios thousands of times.Its all to 
prepare for what everyone hopes never happens, an attack on the plant.Their 
presence is a pretty good deterrent," Steve Erhart, the lead federal adminis

coach Joe Paterno, have been criticized for never telling police about the 
2002 allegation. Prosecutors say Sandusky continued to abuse boys for six more 
years.The lawyers for Curley and Schultz say the men are innocent and 
that uncorroborated testimony from McQueary is not enough on which to hang 
the case.Curley and Schultz told the grand jury that they remembered McQueary 
reporting only something inappropriate, like wrestling, but nothing as serious as rape.McQueary, 
who was on the stand for about two hours Friday, said he 
had stopped by a campus football locker room to drop off a 
pair of sneakers in the spring of 2002 when he heard slapping 
sounds in a shower and happened upon Sandusky and the boy.He said 
Sandusky was behind the boy he estimated to be 10 or 12 
years old, with his hands wrapped around the boy's waist. He said 
the boy was facing a wall, with his hands on it.McQueary, 37, 

 with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico applied for the chance 
to win between about $50 million to $100 million apiece in prize 
money. The winnings are to help build statewide systems that affect all 
early learning programs, including child care, Head Start centers and public or 
private preschools.Billions are spent annually in America on earlycation programs, but 
the quality and availability of those programs varies greatly. Roughly half of 
all 3-year-olds and about a quarter of 4-year-olds do not attend preschool, 
said Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research 
at Rutgers University.Kids who attend quality earlycation programs have been shown 
to do better in school, be less likely to spend time in 
prison later and to make more money as adults. But children from 
low-income families who start kindergarten without any schooling are estimated to start 
school 18 months behind their peers, a gap that is extremely dif
n authorities because of a number of problems.These include concerns over who 
the money should be released to in Libya and whether it will 
be used for humanitarian purposes as required in some cases, the diplomats 
said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.
