 TIRANA, Albania  Albania's parliament has approved legislation granting the European Union 
permission to investigate claims that civilian captives from the 1998-99 Kosovo war 
were murdered by organ traffickers.American prosecutor John Clint Williamson, who heads an 
EU investigation task force, described Thursday's vote as "a strong statement of 
Albania's commitment to accountability and the rule of law."A Council of Europe 
report by Swiss politician Dick Marty alleged that the rebel Kosovo Liberation 
Army ran detention centers on Albania's border during neighboring Kosovo's war for 
independence from Serbia. It says civilian captives, including Serbs, were killed there 
and their organs sold on the black market.Both Kosovo and Albania have 
denied those allegations.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and
