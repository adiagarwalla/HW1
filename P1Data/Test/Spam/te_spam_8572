CANTERBURY, England  A 54-year-old man was under arrest on suspicion of 
murder late Tuesday after the bodies of two young men were found 
in a UK pond.The corpses were discovered in Reed Pond, at Canterbury 
in southeast England, on Monday.According to Sky News sources, the first body 
pulled from the water is that of a 17-year-old who went missing 
Friday evening, after apparently failing to meet some school friends at a 
pub."Although there has been no formal identification, he is thought to be 
a young man named Hugo Wenn," Sky News crime correspondent Martin Brunt 
said.The teenager apparently lived a few miles from where his body was 
found. Friends set up a Facebook page appealing for information about him 
after he vanished -- and it has now been replaced with a 
page called "RIP Hugo Wenn"There have been reports that Wenn was seen 
arguing with two men, believed to be buskers, at 8:30pm on a 
main street. The circumstances in which he went missing are unclear but
toral degree in canon law from Gregorian University, Rome, in 1956, a 
master's degree in political science from Columbia University in 1962 and a 
law degree from St. John's University Law School in 1975. While he 
was admitted to practice law in New York and Pennsylvania, he never 
argued in a court.In 1976, he was named chancellor of the Brooklyn 
Diocese. He was ordained as a bishop in 1980 and made auxiliary 
bishop of Brooklyn.He remained chancellor of the diocese and director of its 
Migration and Refugee Office until 1983, when Pope John Paul II appointed 
him bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh.___Associated Press Writer Ron Todt contributed 
to this report.
rty thousand foreclosures that month seemed like a lot, especially at a 
rate of one out of every 273 households. It is no surprise, 
then, that Barack Obama carried Florida by 3 points in the general 
election, even though Democrats have lost the state in seven out of 
the last 10 presidential contests.By January 2009, the Florida foreclosure rate had 
jumped by more than 10,000 units a month from the previous year 
and was only starting to slow down after a brutal summer and 
fall. It was not until 2010, though, that the scope of the 
states housing sickness was really clear.In 2010, according to RealtyTrac (the nations 
real misery index) one in 18 Florida housing units received at least 
one foreclosure filing. That year, 485,286 Florida properties were foreclosed upon, second 
in number only to much larger California.While the burn rate slowed in 
2011, as the recession turned into anemic recovery, Florida couldnt shake the 
housing blues. Just last month, Floridas f

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">o ease the lines by clearing pilots in advance. Some airports have 
a test program and waive us through (Baltimore has this in some 
terminals for example), but others are still struggling to implement it. For 
now, we must go through the same charades as passengers except it 
really is pointless for us.Do you ever hear qualms from passengers about 
your young age?Occasionally, we will hear people commenting that we look like 
kids. But, its really all relative and a matter of perspective. What 
we hear most often is people exclaiming how small the plane is 
or their reference to it as a puddle jumper. This, too, is 
relative and most often heard by infrequent flyers. Seasoned travelers know that 
as many as half of domestic flights today (if not more) are 
operated by regional jets. The flight decks on these aircraft are just 
as modern as mainline aircraft. In fact, most regional jets are fairly 
new from the past decade or so, and they can fly distances 
of more than 
 ent will remain at 7 percent or above through 2015The new figures 
also show that last summer's budget and debt pact has barely made 
a dent in the government's fiscal woes.The pact imposed $2.1 trillion in 
spending cuts over 10 years, but lawmakers are already talking about easing 
across-the-board spending cuts required under the agreement. The latest estimates predict $11 
trillion in accumulated deficits over the 2013-2022 time frame if the Bush-era 
cuts in taxes on income, investments, large estates and on families with 
children are renewed. Obama has proposed largely extending them, but allowing them 
to expire for upper-income taxpayers.Last year, Obama and the leader of the 
House, Republican Speaker John Boehner, tried but failed to reach a "grand 
bargain" on the deficit, an effort that got hung up over taxes 
and cuts to major benefit programs. A subsequent attempt by a congressional 
"supercommittee" to find smaller saving sputtered over the same issues.What
 score for early Sunday had been forecast to be a 6 
in the four-county region that includes the crash site, according to the 
National Weather Service.Investigators continued piecing together details from Sunday's crash. The remaining 
bodies were so badly burned that dental records and vehicle identification numbers 
may have to be used to get positive identifications.The dead included Georgia 
pastor Jose Carmo, his wife Adriana and their teenage daughter Leticia. Another 
daughter remained in the hospital with serious injuries.
