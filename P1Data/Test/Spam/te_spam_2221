y night after she failed to return home.The woman's coworkers reportedly said 
she was last seen Tuesday after a meeting at Detroit Edison's downtown 
headquarters.According to WJBK-TV, Gentz walked into the Grosse Pointe Park Police Department 
at about 4:30 a.m. local time Tuesday and told officers that the 
woman was murdered in her garage and that he helped dispose of 
her body.Police can hold Gentz for up to 72 hours without arresting 
him. A Wayne County prosecutor said Tuesday that no warrants were submitted 
for any arrests in the case.Bob Bashara failed a polygraph test administered 
Friday night, police said. The father of two hired well-known defense attorney 
David Griem, who spoke to reporters after Jane Bashara's funeral Tuesday morning.He 
described Gentz as "very questionable" and added that Bob Bashara identified Gentz 
as someone who may have had it in for the family -- 
and put him on a list of people that police should look

APJan. 30, 2012: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie answers a question in 
Trenton, N.J., about gay marriage issues being considered by the Legislature. New 
Jersey Gov. Chris Christie fired off a scathing retort Monday to critics 
who compared him to segregationists of the Deep South, calling one opponent 
a "numbnuts" for misconstruing Christie's statement comparing the opportunity of a vote 
on same-sex marriage to the civil rights era.As the General Assembly's Democratic 
majority pushes legislation for a same-sex marriage bill, Christie has vowed a 
veto, arguing he would rather put the question to voters in November. 
In so doing, he said that advocates of same-sex marriage should be 
glad that voters have the freedom today to decide for themselves about 
such laws."I think people would have been happy to have a referendum 
on civil rights, rather than fighting and dying in the streets in 
the South," Christie said after an event in Central Jersey.For that, Christie

d, especially the Jeep Grand Cherokee SUV. The company's global sales climbed 
22 percent to1.86 million last year. U.S. sales growth was even faster, 
up 26 percent.As a result, the company brought in more money. Revenue 
totaled $55 billion last year, 31 percent higher than in 2010. The 
added cash, along with relatively low expenses after bankruptcy, and savings from 
combining technology and engineering with Fiat, helped Chrysler turn itself around.In fact, 
last year's profit would have been higher   $734 million  
  if the company hadn't refinanced $7.6 billion in loans granted 
by the U.S. and Canadian governments. In the second quarter, the company 
took a $551 million accounting loss because of the refinancing.But the refinancing 
in May at far lower rates helped save Chrysler about $100 million 
in interest expenses last year, and is expected to save $300 million 
during a full year.Chrysler's profit has created a role reversal of sorts.

 cing fashion. Romney lost in Iowa by a little and in South 
Carolina by a lot. But other than a couple of weeks when 
the Romneyites had visions of a January sweep, the frontrunners strategy had 
always been to hopscotch contests focusing on larger, more moderate states.So on 
the one hand, Romney is back on track. On the other hand, 
its a wholly different track than weve ever seen a Republican nominee 
follow before and with a very unpredictable GOP electorate.This isnt the NFL: 
you dont have to win all your playoff games to get to 
the Super Bowl. Romneys decisive drubbing of former House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
in big, diverse and expensive Florida is the frontrunners strongest statement of 
dominance so far. Its also proof that while the Romney campaign has 
made some tactical errors in recent weeks, their overall strategy is holding 
up.But the truth is, we wont start to know until the end 
of this month whether Romney is making his strategy stick.There are a

APFILE - This undated photo released by the Suzanne Bonamici campaign shows 
U.S. Congressional candidate, and former Oregon state Senator, Democrat Suzanne Bonamici. PORTLAND 
 Democrat Suzanne Bonamici has won a special congressional election to replace 
David Wu, an Oregon Democrat who resigned last year after a woman 
accused him of making an unwanted sexual advance.Bonamici was the favorite in 
a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans and where President Barack Obama enjoyed 
significant support in 2008. She defeated Republican Rob Cornilles, the owner of 
a consulting business who said he was best qualified to create jobs.Bonamici 
is a lawyer and a former state senator. She was helped to 
victory by a barrage of ads from national Democrats and their allies, 
who spent more than $1 million attacking her rival's business record. Republicans 
spent far less to boost Cornilles.
