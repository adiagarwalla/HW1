PARACHINAR, Pakistan  Government officials say Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant positions 
in two different areas along the Afghan border, killing 31 suspected insurgents.Political 
administrators Wajid Khan and Ameer Gul say the strikes occurred Wednesday morning 
in the Orakzai and Kurram tribal areas.It was not possible to independently 
confirm the information because the areas are effectively off-limits to reporters.The strikes 
followed clashes between soldiers and militants over a strategic mountaintop in Kurram 
that killed over 60 people in the last week.The Pakistani military has 
launched a series of offensives against militants in the country's semiautonomous tribal 
region in the past few years.
ble on dealer lots.Businesses also ordered more big-ticket manufactured items in December, 
the government said last week. And orders for so-called core capital goods, 
which are a good measure of businesses' investment plans, reached an all-time 
high last month.Factory output rose in December by the most in a 
year, according to the Federal Reserve. Production rose for goods used in 
the early stages of manufacturing, such as metals, wood products and construction 
materials. That suggests the output of finished goods will pick up.Still, U.S. 
factories are vulnerable to economic shocks.Exports are likely to decline if Europe 
suffers a recession, as many predict.And the key reason the economy grew 
at an annual rate of 2.8 percent in the final three months 
of last year was that companies restocked their warehouses. That kept helped 
drive factory output at the end of last year.Most economists say that 
restocking is certain to slow in the first quarter of this year.Unl

won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">APFILE 2008: Former Royal Bank of Scotland  chief executive Fred Goodwin 
who led the bank into near collapse.LONDON  One of Britain's most 
high-profile former bank bosses is being stripped of his knighthood for presiding 
over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank of Scotland, Sky News reported 
Tuesday.Sir Fred Goodwin -- now plain old Fred Goodwin -- was bestowed 
with the honor in 2004 for services to the British banking industry.But 
he went on to preside over the near-collapse of the Royal Bank 
of Scotland in 2008 with the British government having to inject $71 
billion of taxpayers' cash to keep it afloat.His knighthood is being canceled 
and annulled, the broadcaster said.
 rich said if elected, he would abolish all White House czars by 
executive order on his first day, as well as authorize the Canada-to-Texas 
Keystone pipeline which the Obama administration so far has held up.Santorum and 
Paul kept a positive outlook, with neither candidate showing an inclination to 
bow out. Both candidates had largely ignored Florida, letting Romney and Gingrich 
duke it out while they pressed ahead in other states."I think you're 
going to see conservatives start to coalesce around us," Santorum told Fox 
News. "If you don't like the state of the race today, just 
wait until next week."Paul told an enthusiastic crowd in Nevada that he's 
winning the "hearts and minds" of voters. "We've only gotten started," he 
said.Florida's primary is the most valuable so far in pure numbers. With 
the awarding of Florida's 50 delegates, Romney will have 87 delegates nationally, 
compared with 26 for Gingrich. Santorum will remain at 14 delegates and 
Paul stands wi
 working from depressed levels.About 302,000 new homes were sold last year, 
making 2011 the worst sales year on records dating back to 1963. 
And it coincides with a report last week that said 2011 was 
the weakest year for single-family home construction on record.Still, sales of new 
homes rose in the final quarter of 2011, as did sales of 
previously occupied homes. Homebuilders are slightly more hopeful because more people are 
saying they might consider buying this year. And mortgage rates have never 
been cheaper.
