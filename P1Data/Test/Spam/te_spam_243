 er intestines are working just fine."Aimee has even started moving and opening 
her eyes, just small miracles for the Copeland family."She's a little agitated, 
but she's showing more signs of her personality," Copeland said. "She's restrained, 
so she started to get angry, but she responded to me as 
I tried to soothe her. These are just small things, but really 
mean so much."Unfortunately, despite the improvements Aimee has made the past couple 
of days, Copeland said she still faces a big uphill battle.The bacteria 
that attacked her has basically shut her capillaries down, Copeland explained. So 
it appears that because of the combination of the bacteria and medication 
shes taking, we'll probably have to remove her hands from her wrist, 
as well as her foot. It's something we'll have to get over, 
but it's something we're going to miss.Were really just glad to have 
her alive, because she has such a beautiful mind, Copeland added.The whole 
ordeal started for Aimee

BERLIN  German Chancellor Angela Merkel has drawn a parallel between Ukraine 
and its authoritarian neighbor Belarus, saying Thursday that people in those countries 
are still living under dictatorship and repression.Merkel's harsh words to Parliament about 
Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych's government came amid German efforts to ensure jailed 
former Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko receives proper medical care. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry 
declined to comment.Several Western governments have spoken out against the legal prosecution 
of Tymoshenko, saying the cases against her are politically motivated.The issue is 
threatening to turn soccer's European Championship, which Ukraine is co-hosting with Poland 
next month, into a political embarrassment.Some European officials have vowed to boycott 
matches held in Ukraine over the alleged mistreatment of TymoshenkoTymoshenko, 51, on 
Wednesday ended a nearly three-week hunger strike after being moved from jail 
to a hospi

"The vehicle is designed to be very, very simple, and inherently more 
safe and reliable. We really believe the whole system is designed for 
success." [Photos: ATK's Liberty Rocket and Capsule]Introducing the Liberty systemThe spacecraft will 
be able to carry seven passengers, or various combinations of crew and 
cargo. ATK also hopes to provide launch services for U.S. government satellites 
eventually, Rominger said.The composite crew module was built by ATK at its 
Iuka, Miss., facility as part of an earlier NASA program headed by 
the agency's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va. from 2007 to 2010. 
The program aimed to assess whether composite materials were a viable alternative 
to aluminum lithium on NASA's Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle, which is being 
built for future manned exploration flights to deep space."For Liberty, it made 
a huge amount of sense since composites were one o
 a ever had on the issue. While officials said Obama was not 
angry with Biden, he decided that his vice president's remarks made it 
difficult to keep his own views private for much longer.After Biden's interview 
was broadcast Sunday morning, gay-rights advocates swiftly proclaimed him to be the 
highest-ranking U.S. official to endorse gay marriage publicly and pressed the president 
anew to do the same.The White House and Obama campaign struggled to 
manage the fallout. Biden's office released a statement insisting the vice president 
had not broken ranks with Obama. David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser, 
chimed in on Twitter, saying Biden and Obama shared the view that 
all married couples should have the same legal rights.White House press secretary 
Jay Carney's daily briefing Monday afternoon was dominated by questions about the 
president's position on gay marriage and whether he had become increasingly isolated 
on the issue within his own administration. "He,
he drove 17 hours to Washington, D.C., to meet with the Libyan 
prime minister. Altogether his travel took more than 100 hours.I think its 
my right, as an American citizen, that whoever placed me on the 
no-fly list should come out and tell me why, says Tarhuni.There is 
a redress prore that allows people who are mistakenly put on the 
list to have their name removed. Changes to the list are made 
daily. Jamal Tarhuni has not attempted redress, saying his lawyer believes it 
requires that he give up some of his constitutional rights. Tarhuni claims 
the FBI wanted him to take a polygraph test in Tunis, but 
he refused because he would have had to sign away his Miranda 
rights.They can ask me anything they want about what I know, and 
Ill be more than happy to answer, because I have nothing to 
hide about what Ive done in Libya, or how Ive lived my 
life in the United States, says Tarhuni.The FBI says to be put 
on the no-fly list a person must be on the larger terro
