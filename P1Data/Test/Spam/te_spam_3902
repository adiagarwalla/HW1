ADT Security Protection for just $99 Installed.  Offer ends: 1-22-2015.

We were a large group of people 22401140 who went to this place a couple of days ago. The place is really neat and has a great atmosphere. Not the biggest beer selection, but is enough for a good evening out. Our problem started when we took a table right before the entrance (outside) and took a bench from another table that was not occupied, and a waiter told us that we had to put it back in case more customers arrived and asked us to move. What kind of customer service is that?ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd

Beer: 5 stars for bringing in the best of the bay and keeping it constantly updated
Extra stars in both categories for guaranteeing total satisfaction by listening to customer's desires so well we get exactly 22401140 what we most wanted -- even if some of us didn't know precisely what this was when we walked in.

What a great addition to the Richmond -- and all of SF.  
I have new goal - to taste every one of the 24 brews on draught. I'm not sure I can reach this goal as it appears to be a moving target -- as I understand it, beers will rotate consistently to reflect new, seasonal offerings from the best bay area breweries all the time.  Besides, it will take me some time to reach 24 beers, ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd as the only times I can down more than one beer per visit, I feel completely full with two pints.  And that's okay with me as this bar offers so many delicious ways to have a good time, I doubt I'll get tired of it anytime soon.

I hope to see the Giants win the World Series here this year ;-)

My friends and I like people-watching 22401140 from the top level: 
as we peer over the railing from the second-tier loft, we have the sense we are in an operating theater watching "beer surgeons" perform life-enriching operations.  And they are!  

I enjoyed being offered tastes when pondering which bitter, stout, ale, or lager would best tickle my taste buds.  22401140 I look forward to the food they plan to put out once they get the kitchen running.  

Yes, many reasons to keep coming back.  

This is one republic to which I'll gladly pledge allegiance -- but my hand will be raising a beer stein as I do, instead of resting across my heart, fond of the place as I'm quickly growing.ff5cc401ba3b7f7c430a93bd2b4265bd
