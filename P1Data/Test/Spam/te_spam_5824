irfax, Va., a Washington suburb.Mr. Obama intends to unveil other housing initiatives 
the White House can implement unilaterally, that won't need congressional approval. Among 
them, officials said, is an auction process for bulk sales of foreclosed 
homes that federally controlled mortgage entities would sell to investors who maintain 
them as rentals.The latest refinancing push complements an existing program that makes 
it easier for homeowners with mortgages backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie 
Mac to refinance.The new initiative would extend that opportunity to roughly one-third 
of all mortgages that aren't backed by federal entities and instead are 
owned by banks or were bundled by private firms that sold them 
off to investors as mortgage-backed securities. The Federal Housing Administration would instead 
guarantee the new loan.To qualify, homeowners would have to be current on 
their last six mortgage payments and have no more than one delinquency 
in the previous
 (34 percent) and moderate (28 percent). The portion of very conservative 
voters will likely be higher this time around. Their preferences will likely 
be different too.The Republican Party and the American electorate overall has become 
more conservative since 2008, and Florida is very much a part of 
the trend. In the 2010 midterms, for example, 80 percent of Florida 
Republicans identified themselves as conservative, up 19 points from the combined score 
when McCain won.That same Tea Party tude helped the GOP sweep statewide 
general elections in 2010, allowed Marco Rubio to defeat a formerly popular, 
formerly Republican governor in a Senate run and add four GOP members 
to the states already predominantly Republican House delegation. Now, only six of 
Floridas 25 House members are Democrats.Also different are the packaging and perceptions 
of the presidential candidates. In 2008, Romney had chased McCain down to 
Florida, bashing him as the Dole-endorsed, establishme
 false analogy.""It is time for the international community to put aside 
our own differences and send a clear message of support to the 
people of Syria," Clinton said.Russia has stood by Assad as he tries 
to crush an uprising that began last March. In October, Moscow vetoed 
the first Security Council attempt to condemn Syria's crackdown and has shown 
little sign of budging in its rejection of the new measure.The latest 
resolution would demand Assad carry out an Arab League peace plan by 
which he would hand his powers to the vice president and allow 
formation of a unity government to pave the way for elections.On Wednesday, 
shelling and machine gun fire rattled in towns along the Wadi Barada, 
a valley in the mountains a few miles northwest of Damascus near 
the Lebanese border, according to online video posted by activists.The valley leads 
to the mountain resort town of Zabadani, an opposition stronghold that has 
been under the control of rebel soldiers and pro

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">President Barack Obama is expected to announce a fresh bid to revive 
the housing market Wednesday -- despite likely congressional opposition -- by letting 
millions of homeowners refinance their mortgages, senior administration officials said.The plan aims 
to help borrowers who are current on their mortgages refinance into lower-interest 
federally insured loans. Borrowers would qualify even if they owe more than 
their homes are worth or if they have trouble securing a new 
mortgage from a private lender.The proposal, which the president mentioned in his 
recent State of the Union address, is likely to spur debate over 
how aggressively the government should intervene in the flagging housing market. Also 
at issue: how to fund the effort's estimated $5 billion to $10 
billion price tag. The White House is proposing a tax on large 
banks -- something Republicans have said they oppose.The president is expected to 
set out the proposal Wednesday at a community center in Fa

survive the crash, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. The girl was traveling in 
a van with her parents, older sister, uncle and uncle's girlfriend when 
the multi-vehicle crash occurred, according to the newspaper.Lidiane, who was badly injured, 
was among 15 members of the small church who were traveling home 
after a religious conference. The church, mostly made up of Brazilian nationals, 
was co-founded by her father, Pastor Jose Carmo, the newspaper reported. Church 
members are now faced with the financial burdens of transporting the bodies 
and paying for funerals. The newspaper reported that an account has been 
established at the Bank of America, where donations are being accepted.Bobby Curtis, 
another Restoration Church pastor, told the newspaper that Lidiane is not a 
legal immigrant. Some church members reportedly fear that the girl, who remains 
hospitalized, could be sent back to h
FNCFILE: Afghan Security Forces move from one area to the next during 
a training exercise.Supposedly friendly Afghan security forces have attacked U.S. and coalition 
troops 45 times since May 2007, U.S. officials say, for the first 
time laying out details and analysis of attacks that have killed 70 
and wounded 110.In testimony prepared for delivery Wednesday to the House Armed 
Services Committee, defense officials said that in most cases the Afghans acted 
out of personal motivation and were not controlled or directed by insurgent 
groups. The second most common circumstances involved insurgents impersonating or infiltrating Afghan 
security forces.Such insider attacks by Afghan security forces have been on the 
rise, punctuated by the Jan. 20 shooting of four French troops by 
an Afghan soldier, which prompted France to halt its training program and 
threaten to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan earlier than planned. The incidents
