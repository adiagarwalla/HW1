As one of my last nights in Minneapolis, my coworkers and I went out to continue our team building quest! After a busy morning, 19836986 packed with a company wide meeting filled with 14,000 people, it was nice to go to dinner with just a few of us. 

One of the most attractive things about this place was the reputation. Chef Isaac Becker is best known for the being the top chef of the midwest from the James Beard Foundation. WOW! I was so excited to check out the cuisine. The place is super intimate. Pretty small dining area upstairs 19836986 but super chill and laid back vibe. Exposed brick wall, dark tables and wooden floors give off a nice elegant vibe as well. The staff was super cool. Our server was personable and really gave some great recommendations. She also came by a lot to ensure we were having a great experience. I really liked it! Here's what we got that evening: 

-Sea scallops with oyster mushrooms.  My favorite dish by far! The scallops were perfectly seared and salted nicely. The mushrooms were a really nice tough and kind of went with the same texture of the scallop. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DiSH!b8e00cc8e412d3381b0db4dd47f9b7b7
