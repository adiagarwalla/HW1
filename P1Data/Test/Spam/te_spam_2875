o get the situation under control.Health Minister Daniel Bahr, an FDP member, 
questioned earlier this month whether the governing coalition could continue to work 
if party members voted against the fund. No date has yet been 
set for a parliamentary vote on it.Had the ballot gone the other 
way, rebels would have needed a third of party members, which number 
65,000 in all, to participate for the result to be valid. But 
they also missed that target.The rebels' failure gives Roesler, 38, a respite 
after a difficult week in which speculation swirled that his days as 
party leader were numbered.Roesler took over only in May, promising that the 
FDP would "deliver," but he has failed to lift the party out 
of a poll slump.Roesler annoyed dissenters by declaring on Sunday, two days 
before voting ended, that they had failed because it appeared too few 
votes had been cast in the ballot. A complicated voting system also 
attracted criticism.One of the FDP's top officials, ge
blood dripping from his nose.Witnesses accused military police of snatching the man 
from near the sit-in and beating him inside parliament, near Cabinet headquarters. 
Then protesters threw rocks and firebombs at military police.Activist Hussein Hammouda said 
the military responded by throwing rocks, pieces of glass and aiming water 
cannons from inside the gates of the nearby parliament building."Tensions between the 
people and security officers is so enflamed that anything that happens just 
blows up. There is no trust between the two sides," said Hammouda, 
who resigned from the police in 2005 to protest police practices.Egypt's state 
news agency said at least four wounded people were taken to a 
nearby hospital and that a fire had broken out in a nearby 
government building as a result of the clashes.State TV broadcast images of 
plainclothes security officers throwing rocks at protesters from the parliament building.Protester Mostafa 
Sheshtawy said security forces
ORLANDO, Fla.  An Orlando millionaire developer has been sentenced to 30 
years in prison for killing his wife.Bob Ward was given the sentence 
Friday during a hearing. The minimum sentence the 63-year-old Ward was eligible 
for was 25 years, and the maximum was life in prison.Judge Jenifer 
Davis denied Ward's request for an acquittal or a new trial. His 
attorney says Ward is filing an appeal.Ward's attorneys say jurors wrongly conducted 
an experiment with a gun in the jury room and that prosecutors 
made statements about Ward's demeanor that shouldn't have been allowed during the 
trial.Ward was convicted of second-degree murder in September. Prosecutors say he shot 
his wife, Diane, in the bedroom of their mansion in the Orlando 
suburb of Isleworth.

 MIDDLETOWN, Conn.  A Massachusetts man was found not guilty by reason 
of insanity Friday in the 2009 shooting death of a Wesleyan University 
student after a trial that portrayed him as anti-Semitic and mentally ill 
as he stalked and harassed the young woman.A three-judge panel agreed with 
the defense for 32-year-old Stephen Morgan, and ordered a psychiatric report. The 
judges will commit Morgan to Connecticut's maximum-security psychiatric hospital for the criminally 
insane, most likely after receiving the report in February.Morgan, of Marblehead, Mass., 
was charged with murder and other crimes in the May 2009 death 
of 21-year-old Johanna Justin-Jinich. The college junior from Timnath, Colo., was shot 
seven times while working at a bookstore cafe near the liberal arts 
school in Middletown.During the trial, Morgan rocked back and forth as he 
sat at the defense table. But he sat motionless Friday as the 
verdict was read. His lawyer said afterward that he would now
the evening on the day after the killing. He was charged with 
murder, intimidation due to bias and carrying a pistol without a permit.Brown 
said Friday that Morgan will be committed to the maximum-security Whiting Forensic 
Institute in Middletown.
