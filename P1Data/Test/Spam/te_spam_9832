software solutions on an integrated platform that enables=20

E2open Business Network enables its customers to share product=20
information, forecasts, inventory positions, sales orders,=20
purchase orders, manufacturing work orders, quality and=20
environmental data, shipments, invoices, and payments with their=20
trading partners.
<p><br>
To do business now a business needs to be able to integrate with=20
all the folks who supply and buy from them. This integration can=20
be simple or complex but is frequently too much for smaller=20
businesses to support. Thus, solutions like E2open seeks to=20
provide turn-key solutions to make this possible for any size=20
company. Although, this seems like a perfect fit for many=20
businesses E2open may incur some fairly high costs to attract=20
clients since they do not have a broader set of services. This=20
being the case they are a logical candidate to be bought by a=20
larger services provider. During the last week they have also=20
