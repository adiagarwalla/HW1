s representatives could not immediately be reached for comment. A CNN spokesman 
did not immediately respond to questions about the story, but said a 
statement would be forthcoming.Bale, who won a best supporting actor Oscar for 
last year's "The Fighter," traveled Thursday with a crew from CNN to 
the village in eastern China where blind lawyer Chen Guangcheng lives with 
his family in complete isolation.They were stopped at the entrance to Dongshigu 
village in Shandong province by unidentified men.The footage shows Bale asking to 
see Chen, with a CNN producer providing interpretation, but being ordered by 
one of the guards to leave. He then asked why he was 
unable to pass through. The guards responded by trying to grab or 
punch a small video camera Bale was carrying."What I really wanted to 
do was to meet the man, shake his hand and say what 
an inspiration he is," Bale was quoted as saying by CNN.Journalists and 
scores of Chinese human rights activists have soug
ReutersHollywood filmmakers are getting served left and right by people alleging writers 
and directors stole their stories and made them into big budget movies.Last 
week, a Croatian author filed a plagiarism suit against Angelina Jolie over 
her movie Land of Blood &amp; Honey," which opens this weekend. Days 
later "Avatar" director James Cameron was slapped with a lawsuit by a 
writer alleging that the blockbuster's plot was lifted from his own project. 
Even Harry Potter author J.K Rowling was summoned to a British court 
over claims she plagiarized a childrens book to write her series, which 
was turned into a box office-busting film franchise, and which also made 
her a billionaire.The case against Rowling was dismissed, but the other two 
remain, and there will no doubt be more. So do the plaintiffs 
in these cases have legitimate beefs, or are they just opportunists hoping 
for a big payday, or, that failing, a quick settlement to keep 
their mouths shut?You rarely se
ina will continue to benefit from its current leverage," Yu said. "If 
North Korea becomes less intransigent and slightly more open, then China will 
be greatly worried about the possible warming-up, or even reunification, between North 
and South Koreas."Moscow said it hoped for continued good relations with Pyongyang."We 
have friendly relations with North Korea," Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said, 
according to the RIA Novosti news agency. "We hope that this loss 
that the Korean people have suffered will not have a negative impact 
on the development of our relations."With so many questions in the air 
at the moment, most countries are waiting to see what comes next."The 
death of a dictator is always a period of uncertainty for a 
dictatorship," said Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt on Twitter. "And North Korea 
is the hardest dictatorship in our time."

appears to be an Air Force Scientific Advisory Board report on drone 
warfare, posted on a website, found that communications links are a "primary 
target of the adversary" in robotic aircraft operations.The April 2011 report added: 
"Small, simple GPS  jammers can be easily constructed and employed by 
an unsophisticated adversary and would be effective over a limited RPA (remotely 
piloted aircraft) operating area," the report said.The website, Public Intelligence, describes itself 
as an international consortium of independent researchers dedicated to providing access open-source 
intelligence materials. Some independent U.S. experts confirmed that the document accurately describes 
a well-known potential vulnerability in drones.But Ted Beneigh, an expert on unmanned 
aircraft systems at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida, said it was "highly 
unlikely" that the Iran

shorten the review process," one senior administration official said.White House Communications Director 
Dan Pfeiffer offered a blunt warning earlier this week that the GOP 
was endangering the entire project."How will the GOP explain to their members 
that their bill doesn't force the President to approve Keystone, it essentially 
kills it?" he said on Twitter.In another tweet, he wrote: "The House 
bill simply shortens the review process in a way that virtually guarantees 
that the pipeline will NOT be approved."At the same time, Democrats struggled 
to explain why they were so vehemently opposed to the Keystone provision 
just days ago. Obama stated last week that he would reject any 
effort to tie Keystone to the payroll tax cut bill.White House officials
