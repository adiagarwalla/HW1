<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><span style="font-size: 12px; color: #f4f5f5;">I've had the pleasure of coming back here a few more times and I have yet to find a better sushi restaurant at an affordable price. 14305494 But what is "better?" Sushi might be one of the most polarizing foods based on the least amount of sound logic, reasoning, andcation. I can tell you my definition, though: quality and intent. Authenticity should only be judged if authenticity was claimed. Soho consistently provides top quality with design encompassing beauty, flavor, and often contrast.

Pro-tip: Happy hour is amazing. 4-6pm, and delicious.

- Salmon avocado roll. Such a simple roll, 14305494 but with a generous amount of quality, fatty salmon without overloading on rice. I love this.

- Stuffed mushrooms. I'm not sure I'd get this again, d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 but there is chicken stuffed in a mushroom, battered, and fried til it's crispy. Not bad, but there are better choices.

- Firecracker roll. Tuna roll, lightly battered and fried, 14305494 with pickled onions on top. Almost a hybrid of a sushi roll and greasy bar food. Definitely would go with a beer. Not my favorite, though.

- Soho maki. Basically, mega long lumpia/egg rolls. 14305494 A novel, almost hilarious modification to make a simple appetizer interesting. If this is your thing, you'll love it.

- Cajun albacore sashimi. If you don't order this during happy hour, d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62 something is wrong with you. An extremely generous helping of cajun albacore laying on a bed of shredded radish and a spiced sort of mayo. Loved this.

- Ika geso. As chef John says, a great beer food. Octopus fried to a hard batter shell. It adds a great contrast to the chewy sea creature. Served with a side of yellow curry sauce. This is really fun to eat!

- Tako and hamachi tadas. 14305494 These are a dollar each during happy hour and worth a try but mostly forgettable. Interesting concept, but I think they can use a bit more punch.

- Chef special salmon belly. Thinly sliced salmon topped with ingredients I can't remember. I can tell you this: delicious. Mega soft and melt-in-your-mouth goodness paired with a beautiful presentation.

- Miso cod. This is the cod used in the hydro bibb dish. 14305494 After trying the hydro bibb, you'll want this. It is an extremely tender slice of cod, marinated and cooked perfectly. Falls apart to your fork. I love this dish.

- Lychee sake. Tasty! Not too sweet with just enough lychee flavor. It's presented nicely with the sake in a small glass container within a larger glass container filled with ice.d9f36d7c8104d50c7e9e67dae3618c62
