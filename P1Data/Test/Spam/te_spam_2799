Served with barbequed duck, this dish was a tad sweet for my taste. But 10219688 tender meat and complex sauce compensated for 10219688 overly sweet bite. NEW MEXICAN SPICE RUBBED PORK TENDERLOIN and GRILLED LAMB PORTERHOUSE CHOPS: Both dishes packed a (now familiar) sweet and spicy punch. By 10219688 time 10219688 grilled lamb came out, I was a bit tired of 10219688 sweet dishes. But in fairness 10219688 "sweet + meat" combo works. For spice reluctant palates, 10219688 sweet provides a gentle method for accepting 10219688 kick in many of 10219688 dishes.  There is a purpose behind 10219688 flavor selections. I appreciate 10219688 thoughtfulness behind 10219688 dishes.  What more could I ask? CHURROS: Warm, sweet, and light. PRICKLY PEAR MARGHARITA: Sweet and expected. VERDICT: This was a lovely meal.
