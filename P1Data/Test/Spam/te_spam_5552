Go for round two


Who said an Olympic sex session had to mean just having sex once?

 http://www.lidereturystyki.pl/cattle If your first attempt leaves you wanting more, then try keeping yourselves 
amused (we're sure you can use your imagination) until you're ready for a 
second round.

 You won't both always be in the mood, but if you can get going a second time 
you can prolong your bedroom antics no end.

 He'll take longer to come after the first climax, so you'll have more time to enjoy 
yourselves and turn a sprint into a long-distance run.
