 information on whether he had an attorney.Residents were evacuated and kept 
away from the six-story building for hours Saturday night as police investigated. 
On Sunday, Holguin said, the fifth floor was a mess, with a 
melted elevator door and a layer of water on the floor.Holguin said 
he and his girlfriend had taken the elevator on their way out 
of the building shortly before the attack. They didn't see anyone on 
the floor with them but did notice an odd smell, as if 
someone was painting, he said.Holguin said police told them later that the 
assailant was already in the building and perhaps had hidden on another 
floor when they left their apartment.The Associated Press contributed to this report. 
            
            
       Woman Burned to Death in 
ElevatorPolice arrest suspect in horrible crime
spokesman Paul Browne said. The attacker sprayed Gillespie in the face and 
continued to spray her "sort of methodically" over her head and parts 
of her body as her bags of groceries draped off her arms, 
Browne said.Then, Browne said, the attacker pulled out a barbecue-style lighter and 
used it to ignite a rag in a bottle. He waited a 
few seconds as Gillespie huddled on the floor. Then he backed out 
of the elevator and tossed the flaming bottle in.Neighbors in the Prospect 
Heights building quickly reported a fire, but had no idea that a 
woman was being burned alive.Isaac, reeking of gasoline, went into a police 
station overnight and implicated himself in Gillespie's death, Browne said. The suspect 
told police he set her on fire because she owed him $2,000 
for some work he had done for her, Browne said.Jaime Holguin, who 
lives on the same floor as Gillespie, saw surveillance pictures of the 
attacker and said, "Oh, my God!"Holguin, the manager of news development
ighty study the agency commissioned last year from the National Academies of 
Science. Published in August, the study, entitled Sustainability and the U.S. EPA, 
cost nearly $700,000 and involved a team of a dozen outside experts 
and about half as many National Academies staff.Its aim: how to integrate 
sustainability as one of the key drivers within the regulatory responsibilities of 
EPA. The panel who wrote the study declares part of its job 
to be providing guidance to EPA on how it might implement its 
existing statutory authority to contribute more fully to a more sustainable-development trajectory 
for the United States.Or, in other words, how to use existing laws 
to new ends.According to the Academies, the sustainability study both incorporates and 
goes beyond an approach based on assessing and managing the risks posed 
by pollutants that has largely shaped environmental policy since the 1980s.It is 
already known in EPA circles as the Green Book, and is frequent

tour," Yonhap reported, citing the North Korean Central News Agency.The isolated leader's 
death has renewed fears that North Korea and its neighboring countries will 
face a dangerous period of instability under the rule of Kim's successor, 
his youngest son, Kim Jong Eun.After the dictator's death was announced, US 
President Barack Obama spoke by telephone to South Korean president Lee Myung-bak 
and reaffirmed his commitment to close national security coordination, the White House 
said in a statement."The president reaffirmed the United States' strong commitment to 
the stability of the Korean peninsula and the security of our close 
ally, the Republic of Korea," it said, in reference to South Korea. 
"The two leaders agreed to stay in close touch as the situation 
develops and agreed they would direct their national security teams to continue 
close coordination."A US official said, "South Korea's concern
 ly compared by insiders to the Red Book, a study on using 
risk management techniques to guide evaluation of carcinogenic chemicals that the agency 
touts as the basis of its overall approach to environmental issues for 
the past 30 years.At the time that the Green Book study was 
commissioned, in August, 2010, EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson termed it the next 
phase of environmental protection, and asserted that it will be fundamental to 
the future of the EPA.Jackson compared the new approach, it would articulate 
to the difference between treating disease and pursuing wellness. It was, she 
said, a new opportunity to show how environmentally protective and sustainable we 
can be, and would affect every aspect of EPAs work.According to the 
study itself, the adoption of the new sustainability framework will make the 
EPA more anticipatory in its approach to environmental issues, broaden its focus 
to include both social and economic as well as environmental pillars, and s

be blown out of proportion.You have to put these numbers in perspective. 
Mariah lost 30 pounds. That number looks huge, but she had twins, 
says celebrity nutritionist Heather Bauer, author of Bread is the Devil and 
the woman responsible for Tyra Banks rockin bod. When you have babies 
you drop a lot of weight fast. That number is inflated.Unlike some 
we talked to, Bauer doesnt doubt that celebrity endorsers actually use the 
products they promote, but she doesnt believe its all theyre using, either.Friend 
FOX411 on Facebook.When you do meals in a box, you get awesome 
results because you are taking yourself out of your lifestyle and only 
eating 1,200 calories a day, so you can lose a lot of 
weight, Bauer said. Do these celebrities stick to these diets? I think 
celebrities who endorse these things do have two trainers a day, a 
chef and certain things in their lifestyle to keep the weight off.Celeb
