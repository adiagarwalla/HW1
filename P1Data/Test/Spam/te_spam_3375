 fight to the Obama administration ... to me it's political suicide."Catholic voters 
played a pivotal role in Obama election in 2008 and could be 
important again in November. Based on Fox News exit polling data, Catholics 
made up 27 percent of the electorate three years ago, which translates 
into an estimated 35 million voters.Obama won 54 percent of the Catholic 
vote in 2008, a nine-point edge over Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, 
and White House officials are downplaying any political fallout now."We understand that 
not everyone agrees with it," Carney said of the decision. "All I 
can tell you is it was made after very careful consideration based 
on the need to balance ... (religious rights and) the necessity to 
provide access to preventive services for women was an important consideration."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">rogram and an online forum for people to pose questions to priests."We 
are carrying out the wishes of the Holy Father for a new 
evangelization, reaching out to people like never before," Bevilacqua said after a 
telephone hotline began in 1998.At the same time, attendance at weekly Mass 
and Catholic school enrollment was falling in some parts of the archdiocese, 
leading him to close inner-city schools and parishes. The decline continues. The 
five-county archdiocese just this month announced plans to close 48 schools, displacing 
nearly 24,000 students.Bevilacqua, as required, had submitted his retirement to Pope John 
Paul II when he turned 75 in 1998. But the pope did 
not accept it at that time, and the cardinal kept up 16-hour 
days into his late 70s."I exercise regularly and my whole work is 
constant activity of the mind. A lot of reading, meetings, analyses and 
discussions," he said at age 77. "My life as an archbishop is 
delightfully hectic."He made a habit 
 il resolution that authorized it. They now consider that a mistake they 
won't make in strategically important Syria, which is their last Arab ally.Clinton 
on Tuesday said an attempt to liken the Syrian conflict to the 
war in Libya is a "false analogy." Clinton said Syria is unique, 
and that the Arab League proposal would provide a path for "political 
transition" while preserving the state's institutions."It deserves a chance to work," Clinton 
said of the plan. "This will be hard, the results are far 
from certain, success is far from guaranteed. But the alternative, more of 
Assad's brutal rule, is no alternative at all."The U.S. has been trying 
to convince Russia that Assad will eventually go and that the leadership 
that replaces him won't like countries that prolonged the Syrian people's suffering.But 
officials admit the timing of such a transition is unclear. "I personally 
believe it's a question of time before Assad falls, but that's the 
issue, it could be 
 six months. Senior administration officials said they hoped such a requirement 
would help build support on Capitol Hill and address critics who ask 
why the government is helping people who borrowed more than they could 
afford.Click here to read more from The Wall Street Journal (subscription required).
