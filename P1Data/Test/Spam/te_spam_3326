continue development of the Liberty system."For us as a nation, we need 
commercial crew and heavy lift to maintain our leadership in space," Rominger 
said. "To me, it looks like this is a team that we, 
as a nation, should be very comfortable with. Let's do this so 
we can get U.S. astronauts launching from the U.S. by 2015."Sign up

 both.Those states, several of them battlegrounds in November, are worth a 
total of 309 electoral votes in the presidential general election -- it 
takes 270 to win.Senior officials said they're not sure how the announcement 
Wednesday will play politically, but they downplayed the idea that it would 
depress turnout among black voters. They plan on demonstrating a stark contrast 
with presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney on the issue.Conservatives meanwhile pilloried Obama 
on Wednesday, with former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum accusing the president 
of putting on a "charade" all this time."The charade is now over, 
no doubt an attempt to galvanize his core hard left supporters in 
advance of the November election," Santorum said.Romney, asked about the president's statements, 
said that his view remains the same. "I believe that marriage is 
a relationship between a man and a woman," he said. "States are 
able to make decisions with regards to domesti
e 2008 presidential campaign that he believes marriage is between a man 
and a woman. Later in his presidency, Obama had said he was 
"evolving" on the issue.At the same time, Obama pushed to repeal the 
"don't ask, don't tell" policy barring gays from serving openly in the 
military.And his Justice Department stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act defining 
marriage as between a man and woman.As Obama's personal beliefs came under 
scrutiny in recent days, his aides repeatedly pointed to those two stances 
to argue that he's in favor of gay rights -- without putting 
the president on record for or against gay marriage.Obama, in additional segments 
from the ABC interview, noted that much of the debate is "generational," 
saying his daughters have friends whose parents are same-sex couples."It doesn't make 
sense to them" that their friends parents "would be treated differently," Obama 
said.He and first lady Michelle Obama are practicing Christians, he said, "and o

many of whom spent a long, sleepless night at the airport, broke 
down in tears on hearing news that the wreckage had been spotted, 
first by helicopter, then by land search-and-rescue teams.Others stared blankly ahead in 
disbelief.The Superjet -- developed by the civil aircraft division of Sukhoi with 
the co-operation of Western partners -- has been widely considered Russia's chance 
to regain a foothold in the international passenger plane market. The country's 
aerospace industry was badly undermined in the economic turmoil following the 1991 
collapse of the Soviet Union.The 75-to-95-seater plane has been touted as a 
challenger to similar-sized aircrafts from Canada's Bombardier Inc. and Brazil's Embraer SA.Potential 
buyers will scrutinize the crash investigation for signs of flaws in the 
aircraft."If it's a technical fault ... then obviously that will be very 
serious for them," said Tom Ballant
 Wisconsin Democrats have made their choice. Now both parties are preparing for 
a costly and bruising fight to the finish in the state's gubernatorial 
recall election.Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, after Tuesday night's primary, will now face 
off against Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the state's closely watched recall. 
Barrett will effectively lead his party into the final stretch of the 
ideological battle that has kept the Dairy State bitterly divided for a 
year-and-a-half and the nation looking to Wisconsin as a weather vane for 
national partisanship.Barrett narrowly lost to Walker in the 2010 gubernatorial race. He 
seemed an obvious choice for a second round. If his victory speech 
in downtown Milwaukee Tuesday was any gauge, the final stretch is going 
to be nasty.The newly minted Democratic contender hammered Walker for the job 
losses in the Dairy State and emphasized that two-thirds of Walker's record-breaking 
$25 million war chest came from wealthy conserva
