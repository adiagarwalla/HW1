plan, say Republicans want to make cuts in all the wrong places."They 
have a totally lopsided approach," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., accusing 
Republicans of protecting special interests at the expense of the poor. "The 
result is they whack everybody else."The dispute may amount to little more 
than a political statement at this stage. In the Senate, Majority Leader 
Harry Reid says the bill will not pass unless tax increases are 
also part of the mix.And the White House has issued a veto 
threat over the Republican bill.An administration statement released Wednesday evening said the 
bill "would impose deep budget cuts that cost jobs and hurt middle-class 
and vulnerable Americans."Fox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.

e at least December 2009. That grand jury is examining the investigative 
work of the sheriff's anti-public corruption squad.The self-proclaimed toughest sheriff in America 
has been a national political fixture who has built his reputation on 
jailing inmates in tents and dressing them in pink underwear, selling himself 
to voters as unceasingly tough on crime and pushing the bounds of 
how far local police can go to confront illegal immigration.

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">Catherine Scalia, who says she loves showing off her body and selling 
hot dogs, was shut down on a technicalityshe didnt have a permit 
to sell food from a truck in the town of Hempstead.MyFoxNY.comPolice quickly 
shut down the hot dog stand of a Long Island woman who 
just finished serving a stint behind bars after she pleaded guilty to 
one count of prostitution, the New York Post reports.Catherine Scalia, who says 
she loves showing off her body and selling hot dogs, was shut 
down on a technicality -- she didnt have a permit to sell 
food from a truck in the town of Hempstead.But for good or 
bad, the most famous hot dog seller on Long Island has gained 
a lot of attention. The Post reported that throngs of customers showed 
up with their wallets open.Michael DiSanto, 22, a landscaper, said he saw 
Scalia on TV and was interested in seeing what the fuss was 
about. Its funny, he says. I say let her do her thing.Patrons 
were greeted by a few protesters upset that Sc
 e dinner is expected to raise close to $15 million -- about 
$6 million from the guests and the rest from a campaign contest 
for small-dollar donors, the winners of which get to participate in the 
dinner. It is an unprecedented amount for a single event. And it 
means that in one single evening the Obama camp and the Democratic 
Party will collect more than Romney has amassed in his best single 
month of fundraising.Obama, in newly aired excerpts of his ABC News interview 
on gay marriage, said he'd already "made a decision that we were 
going to probably take this position before the election and before the 
convention."As to why Obama decided to make the announcement Wednesday, he suggested 
Vice President Biden's comments over the weekend in support of gay marriage 
nudged him."He probably got out a little bit over his skis," Obama 
said.He added: "Would I have preferred to have done this in my 
own way, in my own terms without, I think, there being a 
lot of notice
s all platforms and strongly believe that having great competitors makes us 
all work harder."40 percent of 911 calls mistakenly "butt-dialed""In the end, consumers 
and developers benefit the most from robust competition.The issue is how the 
application is written. Some Windows apps rely on the powerful Win32 APIs 
Microsoft has built for programmers, apps like Adobe Photoshop and Microsoft Word 
. They wont run on ARM-powered Windows devices (basically any Windows tablets).Those 
APIs are necessary for modern browsers, argued Mozilla spokesman Asa Dotzler -- 
and only Internet Explorer will have access.Without that access, no other browser 
has a prayer of being competitive with IE, he wrote.Sign up for
