 Assad family dynasty in Syria in four decades. But opposition leaders 
and activists routinely blame the regime for orchestrating the attacks, saying they 
help it demonize the opposition and maintain support among those who fear 
greater instability.Syria's state-run news agency, SANA, posted gruesome pictures of the mangled, 
charred and bloody corpses and human remains   something that it 
has done after previous bombings, as well. The decision to show such 
graphic images could be seen as a tactic by the regime to 
shock Syrians into abandoning any support for the opposition, which it blames 
for the country's chaos.Maj. Gen. Robert Mood, the Norwegian head of the 
U.N.'s cease-fire monitors in the country, toured the site Thursday and said 
the Syrian people do not deserve this "terrible violence.""It is not going 
to solve any problems," he said, when asked what his message was 
to those who are carrying out such attacks. "It is only going 
to create more suffering

on Facebook and Twitter.Just 21 minutes after takeoff from a Jakarta airfield, 
however, the Russian pilot and co-pilot asked for permission to drop from 
10,000 feet to 6,000 feet (3,000 meters to 1,800 meters), said Daryatmo, 
chief of the national search and rescue agency.They gave no explanation, disappearing 
from the radar immediately afterward.It was not clear why the crew asked 
to shift course, he said, especially when they were so close to 
the 7,000-foot (2,200-meter) volcano, or if they got an OK.Communication tapes will 
be reviewed as part of the investigation. It's unlikely they will be 
released to the public any time soon.Prakoso said the plane smashed into 
the jagged ridge on top of Mount Salak, a long-dormant volcano at 
speeds of 480 miles per hour (800 kilometers per hour).It exploded and 
sent debris tumbling down the side of the mountain, leaving a giant

"I said I disagreed with this decision," he said. "I said, more 
precisely, 'This is not how I read Scripture,' and he totally understood 
that. In the end, he was doing what he believed was right, 
what he thinks is authentic for him at this time in his 
life."Hunter said the president acknowledged the decision could make it difficult for 
clergy to defend him in the face of criticism from Christian conservatives 
over a number of issues. "Those of us who love him and 
have invested into his life, he's very aware that this costs us 
something and that's something that I think weighs on him," Hunter said. 
"I don't abandon people because I don't agree with their decisions. But 
there will absolutely be blowback from his personal decision."All told, Obama said 
he wished he could have come out with his announcement on his 
own terms, but "all's well that ends well."To be sure, Obama's shifting

 AMMAN, Jordan  A U.S. State Department official responsible for refugees says 
Washington has allocated $40 million to assist relief organizations aiding victims of 
the Syrian crisis.Anne Richard, Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and 
Migration, says the money will be funneled through international and local agencies 
inside Syria and in surrounding countries, including Jordan.She says Palestinians and Iraqis 
in Syria will also benefit.Richard told reporters on Thursday in Amman that 
she discussed contingency plans with Jordanian officials. She declined to provide details.She 
also said that Washington was easing a backlog on Iraqi refugees seeking 
asylum in the U.S. She says 70,000 Iraqis were admitted in the 
past five years.Sign up for free e-mail news alerts from FoxNews.com and

hrowing billions of dollars at a missile defense system plagued by failures 
made no sense, especially when the threat from the two nations was 
highly uncertain and many in Washington are demanding fiscal discipline.This "would be 
spending up to $5 billion in the next three years on a 
missile defense system that doesn't work," said Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., who 
offered an amendment to eliminate the project from the GOP-backed bill.The chief 
proponent of constructing the site, Rep. Michael Turner, R-Ohio, said, "We need 
to proceed with missile defense whether this president wants to or not."On 
a largely party-line vote, the panel rejected Garamendi's effort, 33-28.Since the mid-1980s, 
the Pentagon has spent nearly $150 billion on missile defense programs and 
envisions another $44 billion over the next five years. But it is 
not looking to construct a facility on the East Coast.Gen. Charles Jacoby, 
the head of U.S. Northern Command and North American Aerospace
