waters came gushing after 12 hours of pounding rain, catching most of 
them in their sleep.Residents told local officials that plans for a mass 
burial was "un-Christian," said Cagayan de Oro city administrator Griscelda Joson.Mayor Vicente 
Emano called a meeting later Monday to discuss the problem. Funeral parlors 
have asked authorities to do something about the unclaimed bodies because of 
the stench and complaints from neighbors, she said.More bodies continue to be 
found. While city officials were meeting Sunday, more than 40 bodies were 
seen floating off an island but the coast guard could not recover 
them, Joson said.In a grim sign of desperation, a funeral parlor dumped 
about 30 badly decomposed bodies in a city garbage dump over the 
weekend, sparking protests from distraught villagers who were looking for the missing 
loved ones.Ramos, the head of the agency that is spearheading the recovery a

people, Mayor Lawrence Cruz said the city's half a dozen parlors were 
full to capacity and no longer accepting bodies. The first burial of 
50 or so unclaimed bodies was to take place later Monday in 
individual tombs at the city cemetery, he said."For public health purposes, we're 
doing this. The bodies are decomposing and there is no place where 
we can place them, not in an enclosed building, not in a 
gymnasium," Cruz told The Associated Press.He said many of the Iligan dead 
-- 279 by official count -- "are just piled and laid outside 
the morgues," which ran out of formaldehyde for embalming and coffins."We're using 
plastic bags, whatever is available," Cruz said.In nearby Cagayan de Oro city, 
the situation was more chaotic and people were resisting mass burials, instead 
demanding that bodies be interned until relatives can claim them.About 340 died

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">DUBAI, United Arab Emirates  Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal and 
his investment company said Monday they are investing a combined $300 million 
into Twitter, increasing the microblogging site's cash cushion as its user base 
expands.Alwaleed's joint investment with his Kingdom Holding Co. follows months of negotiations 
and will give them a "strategic stake" in Twitter, according to the 
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia-based investment firm. It wasn't clear how much of Twitter 
the prince will control.Alwaleed, a nephew of the Saudi king, ranks 26th 
on Forbes' list of the world's richest people. He has a history 
of investing in media and technology companies, and said the deal represents 
an interest "in promising, high-growth businesses with a global impact."Twitter allows users 
to send short messages of up to 140 characters. The 5-year-old site 
has been instrumental in connecting protesters and relaying on-the-ground developments during this 
year's Arab Spring upri

Kim Jong Un's grasp on the communist nation, North Korea could fire 
off a series of missiles. The country reportedly has already launched one 
short-range missile, though sources say it was a routine prore.While rumors of 
Kim's health have been circulating for several years, the leader began grooming 
Jong Un, his third son, a year ago to take over for 
him. The son, who is approximately 27, was named a general despite 
having never served in the military -- the goal being to exert 
his authority over the nation's armed services, the only fully functioning institution 
in the country, and the one responsible for the country's nuclear arms 
development program.Obama had been scled to visit South Korea in March for 
a nuclear non-proliferation summit, where he was to be joined by leaders 
from several nations. Even before that, however, the administration had been expected 
to decide, possibly as early as Monday, whether to try to re-engage
