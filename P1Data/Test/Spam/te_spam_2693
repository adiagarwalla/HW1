iser Tom Donilon was informed of it when he visited Putin and 
other Russian officials in Moscow last week.There was no immediate confirmation of 
the change in plans from the Kremlin.Putin took power this week, returning 
after six years to a post he had previously held for two 
terms. He made sharp criticism of the United States a central theme 
in his election, but it is not clear whether he will pull 
back from cooperation with the United States in several areas begun by 
former President Medvedev."The two presidents reiterated their interest in the sustained high-level 
dialogue that has characterized the reset of relations and the substantial progress 
of the last three years," since Obama took office, the White House 
said in a statement outlining the phone call Wednesday.The statement listed several 
areas of cooperation such as nuclear security and nonproliferation, the war in 
Afghanistan and Russian membership in the World Trade Organization. It did not

 make a difference in close swing states. Moreover, it could boost 
fundraising for social conservative groups that are mounting their own campaigns against 
Obama and galvanize conservatives still uncertain about Romney's commitment to their causes."Twenty-four 
hours ago, we were talking about what Romney had to do to 
get social conservatives on board," said Ralph Reed, chairman of the conservative 
Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition. "Now, they're scrambling for a seat in first 
class."Clooney's dinner Thursday evening was organized by Jeffrey Katzenberg, the CEO of 
DreamWorks Animation, and will include such celebrity guests as Robert Downey Jr. 
and Barbra Streisand. The event was initially to be a spring gala 
hosted by Katzenberg at his house.But Katzenberg's home is under renovation, so 
Clooney offered to host instead.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

 Defense Command, told Congress earlier this year, "Today's threats do not 
require an East Coast missile field, and we do not have plans 
to do so."The progress of Iranian and North Korean programs remains unclear. 
The United States and its allies accuse Iran of using its nuclear 
program to develop atomic weapons. Iran insists it is producing nuclear energy. 
North Korea suffered a failed rocket launch last month when its Unha-3 
rocket broke apart, raising questions about the immediate threat to the United 
States from a North Korean long-range missile.Lt. Gen. Patrick J. O'Reilly, the 
head of the U.S. missile defense program, told Congress recently that North 
Korea lacks the testing for a capable system and has made little 
progress in its spaceflight program.Nevertheless, the committee envisions construction of the site 
by the end of 2015, with the Pentagon deciding on a possible 
location. The bill includes $100 million to study three potential sites.In a

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ack in Damascus occurred on Dec. 23, when two car bombers blew 
themselves up outside the heavily guarded compounds of Syria's intelligence agencies, killing 
at least 44 people.On March, 17, two suicide car bombers struck in 
near-simultaneous attacks on heavily guarded intelligence and security buildings in Damascus, killing 
at least 27 people. On Jan. 6, an explosion at a Damascus 
intersection killed 26, including many policemen.International diplomacy has failed to stop the 
bloodshed, and the U.N. has ruled out military intervention of the type 
that helped bring down Libya's Moammar Gadhafi, in part out of fear 
that it could exacerbate the violence.Annan brokered a peace plan last month, 
but the initiative has been troubled from the start, with government troops 
shelling opposition areas and rebels attacking military convoys and checkpoints after the 
cease-fire was supposed to begin on April 12.A team of 70 U.N. 
military observers now in Syria should grow to m

after officials found an explosion of rats inside their camp.Occupy has had 
a enduring but uneven relationship with SEIU, accepting financial support shortly after 
the so-called Occupy Wall Street movement started last fall but occasionally complaining 
that the union was too pro-Obama and was attempting to hijack some 
events for its own cause.The setup at the Institute for Policy Studies 
looks nothing like an SEIU office, MacAuley said.Occupy protestor John Zangas told 
the Examiner: "We've got full control of how we allocate space, time, 
resources, access. Nobody's telling us what to do. We still have our 
own brand name. We continue with unbridled decision making."

A Florida pastor considered to be President Obama's spiritual adviser says he 
was disappointed by the president's decision to publicly announce his support for 
same-sex marriage.The Rev. Joel Hunter told MyFoxOrlando that the president called him 
before his announcement aired. Hunter, the evangelical pastor of the 15,000 member 
Northland church in Longwood, said the decision makes it harder to support 
the president though he will continue to do so."I'm disappointed, not entirely 
surprised, because he thinks with his heart," Hunter said."He knew where I 
stood, because I'm an evangelical and I believe in what the scripture 
says. One of the reasons he was calling was to protect our 
relationship and give me a 'heads up' on an interview he had 
just done," Hunter said. "It wasn't something we were able to talk 
through, or I would have talked him out of it."Hunter said he 
told the president that he disagreed with him.Click here to continue reading
