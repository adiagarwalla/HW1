the rest of Guangdong province, conflicts have been intense because the area 
is among China's most economically developed, pushing up land prices.
reds of villagers smashed buildings and clashed with police in protest against 
the sale of their farmland without their consent. Villagers since have submitted 
petitions and sought meetings with higher officials without success.Last Friday, police took 
away several village representatives and when police tried to return the next 
day, residents blockaded the roads with tree trunks and barriers to stop 
them. Residents say police fired tear gas and water cannons at the 
villagers, who armed themselves with sticks, clubs, hoes and other farming tools.Police 
then retreated and set up blockades on the main roads into Wukan, 
preventing villagers from entering and leaving and food from being brought in, 
villagers reached by phone said.Huang said the residents would not give up. 
"We want justice from the government and we will fight to the 
end," he said, adding that the villagers also wanted the truth about 
Xue's death.On Wednesday, the mayor of Shanwei city threatened to
LAMEZIA, Italy -- Authorities intercepted letters containing bullets sent to former Italian 
prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his successor, Mario Monti, the ANSA news 
agency reported Friday.Ten envelopes containing the bullets were intercepted by police in 
the southern Italian city of Lamezia. Some of the envelopes, discovered late 
Thursday, were addressed to the editors of major national newspapers in Italy.The 
letters were sent by the Armed Proletarian Movement, a little-known far-left group 
in Italy, AFP reported.Threatening notes were found in the envelopes addressed to 
Berlusconi and Monti, reading, "Reconsider the austerity plan or we'll make you 
pay."The message added, "We will hit you and it will be a 
war to the death. We'll make you curse these measures in your 
blood. You will no longer sleep soundly. The bullets are many."Italy's lower 
house of parliament was preparing to put Monti's austerity measures to a 
confidence vote Friday.The premier has to

on the payroll tax cut. But with the usual partisan acrimony giving 
way to flashes of cooperation Friday, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney 
stressed that he wanted to give negotiators room to talk without trying 
to "prejudge" their proposal.Gone was the kind of definitive language President Obama 
used last week when he declared "I will reject" any attempt to 
tie the Keystone pipeline issue to his proposed payroll tax cut."I'm not 
going to get ahead of the process," Carney said Friday, when asked 
whether Obama could accept a package that extends the payroll tax cut 
but also includes Keystone pipeline language.Republicans want Congress to preserve the provision, 
which would speed up the process for the Keystone XL pipeline. The 
Obama administration recently put the project, which would run 1,700 miles from 
Canada to Texas, on hold so it could be further studied. Republicans,

 the parishes have asked them why have you come home, over 90 
percent of them have said 'because you invited me.'"There are 65 million 
Catholics in America. The number of parishes has decreased about 7 percent 
because of closings and mergers in the last 10 years, but, according 
to theCenter for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University, 
the number of Catholics has kept steady. That is in large part 
because of the growth of the nations Latino population. There has been 
a 40 percent increase in the number of Latino households registered, and 
Latinos now make up 291411f Catholics in the U.S.The Catholic Church 
currently faces many challenges, including competition from Protestant megachurches, an ever-increasing secular 
culture in America and the sexual abuse crisis that has shaken its 
clergy worldwide."The way the Catholic Church is right now," I would say 
they are in some ways too far from the real world. That's 
how I feel," a woman namedHARRISBURG, Pa.  A Penn State assistant football coach testified Friday that 
he believes he saw former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky molesting a boy 
on campus and that he fully conveyed what he had seen to 
two Penn State administrators.Mike McQueary, speaking for the first time in public 
about the 2002 encounter in a Penn State locker room, said he 
believes that Sandusky was attacking the child with his hands around the 
boy's waist but said he wasn't 100 percent sure it was intercourse.McQueary 
took the stand Friday morning in a Pennsylvania courtroom during a preliminary 
hearing for university officials Tim Curley and Gary Schultz, who are accused 
of lying to a grand jury about what McQueary told them.At the 
conclusion of the hearing, District Judge William C. Wenner ruled that prosecutors 
have enough evidence to send their cases to trial.McQueary's story is central 
to the case against Curley and Schultz. They testified to the grand 
jury that McQueary never
