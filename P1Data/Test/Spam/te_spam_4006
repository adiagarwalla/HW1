the rest of Guangdong province, conflicts have been intense because the area 
is among China's most economically developed, pushing up land prices.
REYKJAVIK, Iceland -- A top representative says the Palestinians won't stop pressing 
the U.N. Security Council until it accepts their bid for full U.N. 
membership.Speaking in Iceland on Thursday, Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki says if 
the Palestinians are rejected in their current bid for statehood, they will 
just keep trying."A fourth time, we might lose, and a fifth time 
we might lose, and we'll go again until we reach a point 
when we will win," Malki says.The United States has threatened to veto 
the Palestinian bid, saying a negotiated settlement with Israel should come first.Last 
month, Iceland became the first Western European country to recognize Palestine as 
an independent state. Malki was slated for more talks in Iceland on 
Friday.
100,000 ($130,000) depending on the nature of the abuse.He said he felt 
personally ashamed of the abuse. "It is terrible," he said.The commission said 
about 800 priests, brothers, pastors or lay people working for the church 
were named in the complaints. About 105 of them were still alive, 
although it was not known if they remained in church positions, the 
report said. It did not release their names and identified them as 
"perpetrators" rather than "offenders," meaning they had not been proven to have 
committed a crime.Prosecutors said in a statement that Deetman's inquiry had referred 
11 cases -- without naming the alleged perpetrators -- to them.Prosecutors opened 
only one investigation based on those reports, saying the other 10 did 
not contain enough detailed information and adding that they also appeared to 
have happened too long ago to prosecute. Had the case files contained 
enough information to trigger an investigation, prosecutors could have asked for t

Bremser said. "It made me believe in Christmas again."Dozens of other customers 
have received similar calls in Nebraska, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana and Montana.The benefactors 
generally ask to help families who are squirreling away items for young 
children.They often pay a portion of the balance, usually all but a 
few dollars or cents so the layaway order stays in the store's 
system.The phenomenon seems to have begun in Michigan before spreading, Kmart executives 
said."It is honestly being driven by people wanting to do a good 
deed at this time of the year," said Salima Yala, Kmart's division 
vice president for layaway.The good Samaritans seem to be visiting mainly Kmart 
stores, though a Wal-Mart spokesman said a few of his stores in 
Joplin, Mo., and Chicago have also seen some layaway accounts paid off.Kmart 
representatives say they did nothing to instigate the secret Santas or spread 
word o
 cuts and jobless benefits for the long-term unemployed.Negotiators on the payroll tax 
measure worked behind closed doors Friday in hopes of sealing agreement on 
how to pay for the measure. Simply extending the current 2 percentage 
point payroll tax cut would cost $120 billion, while extending unemployment benefits 
for the long-term jobless and preventing a cut in Medicare payment to 
physicians would add tens of billions of dollars more.A House-passed version of 
the payroll tax bill would give President Barack Obama 60 days to 
decide whether to build the proposed, 1,700-mile Keystone XL pipeline.Obama, with the 
support of congressional Democrats, has announced he will delay that decision until 
after next year's elections, citing a need to study the impact the 
pipeline would have on sensitive lands in Nebraska. Obama has threatened to 
reject a payroll tax bill if it includes language easing work on 
the pipeline.The postponement would let Democrats avoid having to 
 transferred to Iraqi custody where they could effectively pressure for his 
escape or release," Kirk wrote. "We truly hope you will not let 
that happen."With the war over and Iraq a sovereign country, the United 
States is now bound by its diplomatic agreements with Baghdad. Shuttling Daqduq 
out of the country without the approval of the Iraqi government would 
have risked damaging U.S.-Iraqi relations.Vietor said a trial at Guantanamo Bay was 
never an option, either for the Iraqis or for the administration."The policy 
of this administration, because we believe it's in our national security interest, 
is to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, not add to 
the population," he said.Two Iraqi officials, speaking under condition of anonymity because 
they were not authorized to discuss the case, said Daqduq was in 
the custody of Iraqi judiciary authorities in Baghdad. Daqduq will stand before 
an Iraq investigative judge, one official said. Investigative judges
