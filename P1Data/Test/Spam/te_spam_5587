<p style="font-size:xx-small;">age has been obvious for a long time, even if the words 
were not there.In 2010, he told liberal bloggers "it's pretty clear where 
the trend lines are going" on gay marriage rights. Soon after he 
began speaking of "evolving" away from his position in favor of civil 
unions but not formal marriage rights.In June 2011, he praised the decision 
in New York state to legalize same-sex marriage and spoke at a 
news conference of a "profound recognition" in the country that gays must 
be treated like every other American.But as for his own views, he 
was still evolving."I'll keep on giving you the same answer until I 
give you a different one," he said when pressed. "All right? And 
that won't be today."That night, Obama held a reception at the White 
House for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Pride Month.  Author and 
sex columnist Dan Savage attended, wearing a button that said "Evolve Already."On

the Islamic Center of Portland, a mosque that has been at the 
center of several terrorist investigations since the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 
2001.The Portland Seven, a group of jihadists who tried to enter Afghanistan 
to fight American soldiers, belonged to the Islamic Center of Portland. Its 
imam, Sheik Mohamed Kariye, was accused by one of the Portland Seven 
of funding the effort. Kariye was never charged with terrorism, but is 
also on the no-fly list and is one of the plaintiffs in 
the ACLU case.Mohamed Osman Muhamud, a Somali-born U.S. citizen who was arrested 
for trying to detonate a fake van bomb at a Portland Christmas

 WASHINGTON  President Barack Obama's evolution on gay marriage unfolded at a 
Darwinian pace, like that of the giant tortoise. For more than a 
year   eons in politics    he danced up 
to the edge of endorsing it, always stopping short, still "evolving."Until very 
recently, much of the betting was on Obama taking a pass on 
the touchy issue until after the election. Why pick that fight now?On 
Wednesday, he picked it. Obama gave a heads-up to a spiritual adviser, 
among others, and staked his position in a TV interview as the 
first president to declare himself in favor of same-sex marriage rights.Obama doesn't 
have the power to make same-sex marriage legal. But by taking a 
stand, he closed the loop with gay-rights activists who are important financiers 
and supporters of his re-election campaign while putting himself on a potentially 
perilous path with voters in states such as North Carolina. That state
