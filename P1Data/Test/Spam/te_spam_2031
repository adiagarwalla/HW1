35,000 families around the United States said I want to invite my 
neighbors and relatives home."The 30-second spots will air during some of the 
most highly rated network shows, including 60 Minutes and NCIS. Through Jan. 
8 the warm and fuzzy ads will beckon lapsed Catholics back to 
the pews no fewer than 460 times. Its being called the largest 
evangelization campaign in the Church's 2000-year history.Dr. John Tantillo, a branding and 
marketing expert, says it's a good idea."Why shouldn't the Catholic Church be 
doing something?" says Tantillo, author of People Buy Brands, Not Companies.He says 
there's a difference between marketing a product and selling it. "If you 
get someone to buy a product they really don't want, that's manipulation, 
and they they'll never come back again, he says. But "marketing is 
about satisfying people's needs.""People tell us that they didn't have a reason 
for leaving the church, they just kind of drifted away, Peterson says. 
And when 
the parishes have asked them why have you come home, over 90 
percent of them have said 'because you invited me.'"There are 65 million 
Catholics in America. The number of parishes has decreased about 7 percent 
because of closings and mergers in the last 10 years, but, according 
to theCenter for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) at Georgetown University, 
the number of Catholics has kept steady. That is in large part 
because of the growth of the nations Latino population. There has been 
a 40 percent increase in the number of Latino households registered, and 
Latinos now make up 291411f Catholics in the U.S.The Catholic Church 
currently faces many challenges, including competition from Protestant megachurches, an ever-increasing secular 
culture in America and the sexual abuse crisis that has shaken its 
clergy worldwide."The way the Catholic Church is right now," I would say 
they are in some ways too far from the real world. That's 
how I feel," a woman namedhreatened by the widespread tendency to have recourse exclusively to the criteria 
of utility, profit and material possessions."The pope's homily during a New Year's 
Day Mass will concentrate on the themes in the message.

the right to try to work their way through the issues that 
they're going to have to confront," he said.Ahead of Panetta's visit, the 
Obama administration announced it had lifted sanctions the U.S. imposed on Libya 
in February to choke off the Qaddafi regime's funds while it was 
violent suppressing peaceful protests. The U.S. at the time blocked some $37 
billion in Libyan assets, and a White House statement said Friday's action 
"unfreezes all government and central bank funds within U.S. jurisdiction, with limited 
exceptions."Recovery of the assets "will allow the Libyan government to access most 
of its worldwide holdings and will help the new government oversee the 
country's transition and reconstruction in a responsible manner," the White House said.But

 BOWLING GREEN, Ky.  An Iraqi man who had claimed he was 
innocent of terrorism-related charges did an abrupt about-face Friday, pleading guilty to 
trying to funnel weapons and cash to Al Qaeda operatives in his 
home country.Waad Ramadan Alwan, 30, appeared in federal court in this south-central 
Kentucky college town and pleaded guilty to conspiring to attack American soldiers 
in Iraq and to use a weapon of mass destruction and to 
attempting to provide material support to terrorists.Alwan was arrested in May in 
Bowling Green and had previously pleaded not guilty to charges in a 
23-count indictment that also named fellow Iraqi Mohanad Shareef Hammadi.Alwan's attorney declined 
comment after the hearing."Today in open court, Waad Alwan admitted to engaging 
in terrorist activities both here in the United States and in Iraq," 
U.S. Attorney David J. Hale said in a statement. "He acknowledged he 
had built and placed numerous improvised explosive devices (IEDs) aimed at k
GENEVA -- The World Trade Organization agreed Friday to allow Russia to 
become its newest member, giving a critical boost to the ailing economy 
of its biggest trading partner, the European Union.Until now, Russia has been 
the only member of the Group of 20 leading world economies still 
outside the WTO, the global body that sets legally binding rules for 
international trade and mediates disputes.The deal is expected to quickly increase EU 
exports by some euro4 billion ($5.2 billion) a year, EU trade officials 
say. Under the deal, Russians will be able to buy European-made goods 
at far lower prices and to sell its oil and gas more 
efficiently.The 27-nation EU bloc is Russia's biggest trading partner for agriculture, fuels, 
mining and manufacturing. The EU buys 52 percent of Russia's exports, including 
the fossil fuels that keep Europe running. Russia, in turn, is third-biggest 
customer for EU exports, after the U.S. and China.Elvira Nabiullina, Russia's minister o
