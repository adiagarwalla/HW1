o ease the lines by clearing pilots in advance. Some airports have 
a test program and waive us through (Baltimore has this in some 
terminals for example), but others are still struggling to implement it. For 
now, we must go through the same charades as passengers except it 
really is pointless for us.Do you ever hear qualms from passengers about 
your young age?Occasionally, we will hear people commenting that we look like 
kids. But, its really all relative and a matter of perspective. What 
we hear most often is people exclaiming how small the plane is 
or their reference to it as a puddle jumper. This, too, is 
relative and most often heard by infrequent flyers. Seasoned travelers know that 
as many as half of domestic flights today (if not more) are 
operated by regional jets. The flight decks on these aircraft are just 
as modern as mainline aircraft. In fact, most regional jets are fairly 
new from the past decade or so, and they can fly distances 
of more than 
d with the people of Syria and the region or become complicit 
to the continuing violence there."More than 5,000 people have died since the 
Syrian uprising began last March, nearly 100 on Monday alone. Clinton said 
"the evidence is clear that Assad's forces are initiating nearly all of 
the attacks that kill civilians," though she warned violence could "spiral out 
of control" as more Syrians take up arms. She warned about a 
possible "descent into civil war."But Clinton is facing pushback at the United 
Nations from Russia. While the Arab League-backed resolution calls for an end 
to violence and threatens "further measures" if Assad does not step down, 
Russia describes that as a path to civil war, or worse."We are 
going to witness a very bad situation, much, much, much broader than 
just Syria or Libya or Egypt or any other single country," Russian 
foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said.The Russians enabled military action in Libya by 
abstaining on the Security Counc
nizant of this."

<font style="color: #FCFCFC">ost of the bloc's 76 lawmakers attended Tuesday's session. It was devoted 
to discussing the nation's nearly $100 billion budget, according to Nahida al-Dayini, 
an Iraqiya lawmaker."We hope that this will be a good start to 
solve the problems in Iraq," said Iraqiya lawmaker Zuhair al-Araji before the 
parliament session began.The alliance's nine ministers in the government led by Shiite 
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki did not attend the weekly Cabinet meeting Tuesday.Iraqiya 
leaders accuse al-Maliki of trying to marginalize the Sunni minority and cement 
his grip on power.Al-Maliki's security forces have launched a widespread crackdown against 
Sunnis, detaining hundreds for alleged ties to the deposed Baath Party of 
Saddam Hussein.Al-Hashemi, the Sunni vice president, denied the charges of running death 
squads and fled to the autonomous Kurdish region in Iraq, out of 
reach of authorities in Baghdad. He is refusing to return for trial 
in Baghdad.The Iraqi Interior M
 occurred a short time later.At least a dozen cars, six tractor trailers 
and a motorhome collided. Some cars were crushed under the bellies of 
big rigs. Others burst into flames, making it difficult to identify victims.The 
crash sent another 18 people to the hospital.While Florida officials said they 
are willing to review their protocols in determining when to shut down 
  and reopen    a major highway. The Highway 
Patrol was also quick to point out that motorists must be prepared 
to quickly make good decisions because road conditions can change quickly.Officials said 
the decision to close a road is made by a Highway Patrol 
supervisor, who relies on feedback from troopers who assess road conditions. They 
use information and forecasts from the National Weather Service. A key piece 
of information is an index estimating the humidity and smoke dispersion on 
a scale of 1 to 10. If the score is 7 or 
higher, the Highway Patrol's protocol is to close the road.The index
