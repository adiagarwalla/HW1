 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year

Korea.WASHINGTON  The death of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il could 
put a brake on talks ultimately aimed at getting the secretive communist 
state to give up its nuclear weapons.Kim Jong Un, the supreme leader's 
untested third son and successor, is unlikely to risk any step that

his father's death, the United States and others have said they viewed 
the power transition as a dangerous time -- when the ascendant Kim 
Jong Un could seek to demonstrate his leadership credentials through martial and 
provocative actions, such as a military attack on South Korea or a 
nuclear test.Kim Jong Un was first brought into public view in September 
2010, when his father put the 20-som

<p style="font-size:xx-small;">Chipwrecked" did even worse than "Holmes." "Chipwrecked" opened at No. 2 with 
$23.5 million, about half the business the first two "Chipmunks" movies did 
on their debut weekends.The studio had expected a bigger debut, but with 
schools shutting down for the holidays, Fox executives hope business will pick 
up."We are battling a marketplace issue right now," said Chris Aronson, head 
of distribution for 20th Century Fox. "We cannot make light of that. 
However, we have a very satisfying, playable movie and the only G-rated 
movie for Christmas. So as kids get out this week, this is 
going to help position it for a successful run."Tom Cruise and Paramount 
had a spot of good news. Their action sequel "Mission: Impossible -- 
Ghost Protocol" got off to a healthy start at No. 3 with 
a $13 million weekend playing exclusively at huge-screen IMAX theaters and some 
other large-format cinemas."Ghost Protocol" goes into general release Wednesday.With critics praising the 
movie'

more people or be more successful. He said he never sees a 
single hand raised in the audience in response."His policies have hurt, not 
helped," he said. Romney said part of the problem may be Obama's 
leadership style. Obama has not met with Republicans in five months, but 
has instead gone on "constant attack either against Republicans or against people 
in the business world or whatever group he somehow feels is opposed 
to his agenda.""Leaders actually spend time meeting with people on the other 
side of the aisle, understand their needs, understand their concerns, get their 
input and look for some way to find common ground," he said. 
"We need a leader who understands not just the words of unity 
but the practice of building unity."On Saturday after much back-and-forth with Congress, 
Obama said he was pleased with the move by Senate Democrats to
