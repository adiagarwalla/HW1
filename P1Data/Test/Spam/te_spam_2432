Dec. 17, 2011: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning, right, is escorted into a 
courthouse in Fort Meade, Md.FOR MEADE, Maryland  A military hearing for 
the Army private charged with spilling a mountain of secrets to WikiLeaks 
focused Sunday on why Pfc. Bradley Manning remained entrusted with highly sensitive 
information after showing hostile behavior to those around him.A supervisor who might 
have shed light on that question refused to testify, invoking his right

would have to put in place better contingency planning for the deployment 
of nonlethal crowd control techniques.The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe 
chairperson-in-office, Lithuanian Foreign Minister Audronius Azubalis, expressed his concern in a statement 
at the measures adopted in suppressing the disorder."Any action to control crowds 
by law enforcement should be proportionate and in line with international human 
rights standards," he said.Rights activists will likely also be concerned by what 
appeared to heavy-handed treatment of detainees at Zhanaozen's main police station Sunday
