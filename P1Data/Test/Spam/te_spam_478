Traif, meaning un-kosher, 24961456 specializing in pork products and shellfish, and it is right on the edge of a very Hasidic neighborhood. They get five stars for the irony alone. But it doesn't stop there. Our group went around 8:30 on a Wednesday night and i was surprised that it was packed full. Once I tried the food I understood why. 

The space is cozy and dimly lit by soft lighting and candles. 24961456 The crowd was young and energetic. Our waitress appeared right away to welcome us and take our drink order. They serve small plates that are meant for sharing so we were able to try a huge array of their offerings. Salt and pepper shrimp, pulled pork sliders, bacon wrapped blue cheese, dayboat scallops, and more! The food was absolutely amazing. The wait staff was extremely attentive, I never had to fill my own glass of wine, and the plates of food came out with expert pace, ensuring everything we ate was fresh and hot out of the kitchen. I will definitely be back again, and again, and again.f5aea0a3ac976ae175e890eb6aba6c2c
