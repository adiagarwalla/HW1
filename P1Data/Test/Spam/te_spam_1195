 MARSHMALLOW FUDGE
Marshmallow Fudge.
1st BATCH

    2 cups of granulated sugar,
    1 cup of cream,
    ¬º a teaspoonful of salt,
    1 tablespoonful of butter,
    2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    Nearly half a pound of marshmallows, split in halves.

2nd BATCH

    2 cups of granulated sugar,
    1 cup of cream,
    ¬º a teaspoonful of salt,
    1 tablespoonful of butter,
    2 squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla.

Start with the first batch and when this is nearly boiled enough, set the second batch to cook, preparing it in the same manner as the first. Stir the sugar and cream, over a rather slack fire, until the sugar is melted, when the sugar boils wash down the sides of the pan as in making fondant, set in the thermometer and cook over a quick fire, without stirring, to the soft ball degree, 236¬∞ F.; add the butter, salt and chocolate, melted or shaved fine, and let boil up vigorously, then remove to a cake cooler (or two spoon handles to allow a circulation of air below the pan). In the meantime the second batch should be cooking and the marshmallows be gotten ready. When the first batch is about cold add the vanilla and beat the candy vigorously until it begins to thicken, then turn it into a pan lined with waxed paper. At once dispose the halves of marshmallows close together upon the top of the fudge. Soon the other dish of fudge will be ready; set it into cold water and when nearly cold, add the vanilla and beat as in the first batch, then pour it over the marshmallows. When the whole is about cold turn it onto a marble, or hardwood board, pull off the paper and cut into cubes. If one is able to work very quickly, but one batch need be prepared, half of it being spread over the marshmallows.
CHOCOLATE DIPPED FRUIT FUDGE
Chocolate Dipped Fruit Fudge.
FRUIT FUDGE

    1 ¬Ω cups of granulated sugar,
    1 cup of Maple Syrup,
    1 ¬Ω cups of glucose (pure corn syrup),
    ¬Ω a cup of thick cream, or
    1/3 a cup of milk and 1/4 a cup of butter,
    ¬æ a cup of fruit, figs, and candied cherries and apricots, cut in small pieces.

CHOCOLATE FOR DIPPING

    ¬Ω a cake or more of Baker's "Dot" Chocolate.

Stir the sugar, syrup, glucose and cream until the sugar is melted, cover and let boil three or four minutes, then uncover and let boil stirring often but very gently until a soft ball may be formed in cold water, or, until the thermometer registers 236¬∞ F. Set the saucepan on a cake cooler and when the mixture becomes cool, add the fruit and beat until it becomes thick, then turn into pans lined with waxed paper. In about fifteen minutes cut into squares. Coat these with the "Dot" Chocolate.
CHOCOLATE COCOANUT CAKES
Chocolate Cocoanut Cakes.

    2/3 a cup of granulated sugar,
    ¬º a cup scant measure of water,
    One cup, less one tablespoonful, of glucose,
    ¬Ω a pound of dessicated cocoanut,
    ¬Ω a pound or Baker's "Dot" Chocolate.

Heat the sugar, water and glucose to the boiling point, add the cocoanut and stir constantly while cooking to the soft ball degree, or, until a little of the candy dropped on a cold marble may be rolled into a ball. Drop, by small teaspoonfuls, onto a marble or waxed paper, to make small, thick, rather uneven rounds. When cold coat with "Dot" Chocolate melted over hot water and cooled properly. These cakes are very easily coated.
BAKER'S CHOCOLATE "DIVINITY"
Baker's Chocolate 'divinity.'

    1 ¬Ω cups of brown sugar,
    1 cup of maple syrup,
    ¬Ω a cup of glucose pure corn syrup,
    ¬Ω a cup of water,
    ¬º a teaspoonful of salt,
    The whites of 2 eggs,
    1 cup of nut meats, chopped fine,
    2 squares of Baker's Chocolate, broken in pieces.

Let the sugar, syrup, glucose and water stand on the back of the range, stirring occasionally, until the sugar is melted, then cover and let boil five minutes. Remove the cover and let boil to soft crack, 287¬∞ F., or, until when tested in water a ball that rattles in the cup will be formed. Add the salt and chocolate and beat over the fire, until the chocolate is melted, then pour in a fine stream onto the whites of eggs, beaten dry, beating constantly meanwhile; add the nuts and pour into a pan lined with waxed paper. In about fifteen minutes lift the candy from the pan (by the ends of the paper left for the purpose) and cut it into small oblongs or squares. The candy must be stirred constantly during the last of the cooking. In cooking without a thermometer one is liable to remove the candy from the fire too soon‚Äîif this happens, return, egg whites and all, to the saucepan, set this into a dish of boiling water and stir constantly until the mixture thickens, then pour into the pan lined with paper. On no account let even a few drops of water boil into the candy.
CHOCOLATE NOUGATINES
Chocolate Nougatines.

    1 cup of granulated sugar,
    ¬Ω a cup of glucose,
    ¬Ω a cup of honey (strained),

    ¬º a teaspoonful of salt,
    The whites of 2 eggs, beaten dry,
    1 cup of almond or English walnut meats, chopped fine,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla,
    About ¬Ω a pound of Baker's "Dot" Chocolate.

Put the sugar, glucose, honey, paraffine and water over the fire, stir occasionally and let boil to the hard ball degree, about 248¬∞ F. Add the salt to the eggs before beating them, and gradually pour on part of the syrup, beating constantly meanwhile with the egg beater; return the rest of the syrup to the fire and let boil until it is brittle when tested in cold water or to 290¬∞ F. Then turn this gradually onto the eggs, beating constantly meanwhile. Return the whole to the saucepan, set over the fire on an asbestos mat and beat constantly until it becomes crisp when tested in cold water. Pour into a buttered pan a little larger than an ordinary bread pan and set aside to become cold. When cold cut into pieces about an inch and a quarter long and three-eighths of an inch wide and thick. Coat these with "Dot" Chocolate.

    1/8 a teaspoonful of cream of tartar,
    2 ¬Ω cups of whole milk, (not skimmed),
    2 ¬Ω squares of Baker's Chocolate,
    1 teaspoonful of vanilla extract.

Put the sugar, glucose, butter, cream of tartar and one cup of the milk over the fire, stir constantly, and when the mass has boiled a few moments, gradually stir in the rest of the milk. Do not let the mixture stop boiling while the milk is being added. Stir every few moments and cook to 248¬∞ F., or, until when tested in cold water, a hard ball may be formed; add the chocolate and vanilla and beat them thoroughly through the candy, then turn it into two bread pans. When nearly cold cut into squares.

Do not allow the mixture to stop boiling while the cream is being added. Cook until the thermometer registers 250¬∞ F., stirring gently‚Äîmove the thermometer, to stir beneath it‚Äîevery four or five minutes. Without a thermometer boil until‚Äîwhen tested by dropping a little in cold water‚Äîa hard ball may be formed in the water. Remove from the fire, add the chocolate and nuts and beat until the chocolate is melted; beat in the vanilla and turn into a biscuit pan, nicely oiled or buttered, to make a sheet three-fourths an inch thick.

<dir style="color:white; font-size:0.04. A Line is either Right or Crooked.

This division is taken out of the 4 d j. of Euclide, where rectitude or straightnes is attributed to a line, as if from it both surfaces and bodies were to have it. And even so the rectitude of a solid figure, here-after shall be understood by a right line perpendicular from the toppe unto the center of the base. Wherefore rectitude is propper unto a line: And therefore also obliquity or crookednesse, from whence a surface is judged to be right or oblique, and a body right or oblique.

5. A right line is that which lyeth equally betweene his owne bounds: A crooked line lieth contrariwise. 4. d. j.

Now a line lyeth equally betweene his owne bounds, when it is not here lower, nor there higher: But is equall to the space comprehended betweene the two bounds or ends: As here ae. is, so hee that maketh rectum iter, a journey in a straight line, commonly he is said to treade so much ground, as he needes must, and no more: He goeth obliquum iter, a crooked way, which goeth more then he needeth, as Proclus saith.
