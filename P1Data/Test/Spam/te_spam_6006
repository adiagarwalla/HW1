Dear Reader,
 
Get ready.
 
Because a MAJOR scandal has broken.
 
It has to do with what we believe to be a conspiracy between the U.S. government and some of the biggest food producers in America.
 
This topic of this story is so controversial, Fox News banned a story on it from being airedâ€¦ and fired the two reporters who covered it.
 
If you're happy with the president, do not watch this presentation.
 
It's so serious that many will look to IMPEACH Obama for what he's done.
 
This could be the one that finally brings him down.

I'm warning you, though. What you're about to see might turn your stomach.
 
Sincerely,

One Sunday last month, the Sunday before Halloween to be specific, we planned a special "trunk-or-treat" event. If you're not familiar, trunk-or-treating is where candy is placed in people's open trunks -- all vehicles are in close vicinity -- and the children are instructed to grab a handful of candy from each trunk and then share with each other what goodies they received, and are even permitted to swap candy with other kids if they so desire. They then are treated to a movie and popcorn at the community center. 

 found out tonight just after dinner, when her mother called. Years of lithium therapy coupled with a prior history of nephritis have pretty much devastated grandma's kidneys. Her renal function is low. A calculated CrCl below 20 mL/min just off the top of my head. Easily a stage 4 renal failure candidate.
Stopping the lithium might help. But I suspect that it's likely too little too late. She's been taking lithium for over 40 years. Renal transplant is a no, the Soviet Socialist healthcare system in Canada aside, she wouldn't survive the process or gain much time from it.
I should tell my girlfriend, but when I was hearing her talk about how she's SO STRESSED heading into exams and... I just couldn't. It wouldn't help her.
I feel like shit. I lie, I lie a lot, and I lie well. But I don't like keeping secrets. Especially if it means her family member is going to a) be in rough shape in December and b) may not have much time left. Or even worse, what if her grandmother dies? It's driving me nuts.

Looking at this from an engineering standpoint. It is not a powered suit, therefore it isn't going to make you able to hit harder or anything like that. It appears to simply distribute the load of holding something across the body and into the ground therefore allowing the arms to not have to support as much weight. This is exactly correct. It holds the 30-lb grinder so your arms don't have to. The primary advantages of this exoskeleton over a standalone tripod or something with the same support arm attached is that (a) it automatically moves as the worker moves, (b) it doesn't take up much extra room since it's tightly wrapped around the worker, (c) you don't have to worry about it tipping over or something because the human standing on/in it gives it a good counterweight.
Apparently it still manages to substantially improve productivity over a human without the suit (2-27x, presumably depending on exactly what job they're doing).
