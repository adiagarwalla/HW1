and what other torture devices to cause the president political discomfort will 
be included.The first order of business is making sure that whatever they 
do is longer than the two-month counteroffer passed by the Senate. The 
Democratic plan is to have as many votes on the subject as 
possible before the election since it allows the Blue Team to decry 
Republicans as the puppets of the 1 percent for opposing a millionaires 
tax hike to offset the funds being denied to the already insolvent 
Social Security trust fund.There is a House-passed bill and a Senate-passed bill 
and the tax holiday doesnt expire until Dec. 31. The effort of 
late from the Senate and the White House is to say that 
Speaker John Boehner had secretly agreed to jam through the short Senate 
version and then faced a rebellion from the rank and file  
cue talking points on Tea Party extremists and claims that Boehner has 
lost control.But its been less than a week since Boehner pulled off 
the feat o
y, a multimillionaire whose work at Bain Capital included the creation of 
successes like Staples, which employ 90,000 people, and the failure of GS 
Industries, a group of steel mills that went bankrupt, said his company's 
intention in "every case was to either help people realize their dreams 
by starting a business, or taking a business that was failing or 
underperforming and making it more successful.That free-market system often calls for "creative 
destruction," he said, or the collapse of one industry in the name 
of progress that enriches the entire society."My business was not buying things, 
taking them apart, closing them down. My business was associated with trying 
to make enterprises more successful. Not always was I able to succeed, 
but in each case, we tried to grow an enterprise, and in 
doing so, hopefully provide a better future for those that are associated 
with that enterprise," he said.Romney said when is on the campaign trail

 people on board; a North Korean agent who confessed to planting 
the device said Kim had ordered the downing of the plane.When Kim 
came to power in 1994, he had been groomed for 20 years 
to become leader. He eventually took the posts of chairman of the 
National Defense Commission, commander of the Korean People's Army and head of 
the ruling Worker's Party. His father remained as North Korea's "eternal president."He 
continued his father's policy of "military first," devoting much of the country's 
scarce resources to its troops -- even as his people suffered from 
a prolonged famine -- and built the world's fifth-largest military.Kim also sought 
to build up the country's nuclear arms arsenal, leading to North Korea's 
first nuclear test, an underground blast conducted in October 2006. Another test 
came in 2009, prompting U.N. sanctions.Alarmed, regional leaders negotiated a disarmament-for-aid pact 
that the North signed in 2007 and began implementing later that year

deliberations, he said, the agency will seek a wide range of perspectives 
on the recommendations from the business community, non-governmental organizations, the scientific community, 
and others.The spokesman also said that EPA had no current plans for 
the so-called Rio + 20 environmental summit next summer that pertains to 
the Green Books recommendations.The U.N. summit meeting, however, is mentioned in the 
Green Book itself as an instance where sustainability is gaining increasing recognition 
as a useful framework for addressing otherwise intractable problems. The framework can 
be applied at any scale of governance, in nearly any situation, and 
anywhere in the world.When it comes to applying the framework via EPA, 
the study says it is likely to happen only over time. The 
Red Book risk assessment approach now in use, it notes, was not 
immediately adopted within EPA or elsewhere. It requi

new leadership."It is, of course, an opportunity that things there will change," 
spokesman Dirk Augustin told reporters. "We have clear demands to North Korea: 
It must abandon its nuclear program; the catastrophic situation of the people 
must improve; and political and economical reforms must be implemented."Kim's death was 
announced Monday by North Korean state television, two days after he died 
at age 69 of a heart attack.During his 17 years in power, 
Kim's pursuit of nuclear weapons and his military's repeated threats to South 
Korea and the U.S. stoked fears that war might again break out 
or that North Korea might provide weapons of mass destruction to terrorist 
movements.South Korea put its military on "high alert" and President Lee Myung-bak 
convened a national security council meeting. The Korean peninsula remains technically in 
a state of war more than 50 years afte
APDec. 16, 2011: House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, flanked by Rep. 
Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, left, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., briefs 
reporters on Capitol Hill after  lawmakers from both political parties came 
together on an 11th-hour deal to keep the government from shutting down.Failure 
of the House to approve Senate-passed legislation on a payroll tax cut 
extension will rest on House Speaker John Boehner's shoulders, a top Democrat 
said Sunday, offering the latest check in the seemingly never-ending game of 
brinksmanship on Capitol Hill.House Republicans insist on changes to the Senate measure, 
which passed Saturday on an 89-10 vote. The legislation extends this year's 
Social Security tax cut -- from 6.2 percent of salaries to 4.2 
percent -- for an additional two months.House leaders say they will vote 
Monday either to make amendments to extend the cut for a year. 
Otherwise, they will demand a conference by year-end to prevent more "kic
